The Hotel is located in the midtown and you can go out for a walk and buy some souvemirs like tipical clothes from the region and carrings neackledes, etc. The also celebrete fair where Virgen de San Juan you can have fun during your stay and it's a beautiful and interesting place. "
40,We spent a night here at this hotel when we first pulled in to town.... it was adequate for our purposes.... the internet wifi worked just outside our room door.  The staff were friendly and helpful even though we didn't speak Spanish.
40,Our room was clean and only a short walk to the beach. Good price for location. Was great to have a pool. However we booked last minute so there wasn't too much else available but we were informed by a taxi driver that you can get a beach cabana for very good value.
10,"Booked for 8 nights but stayed one( only because we arrived late and were too tired to look for something else) and checked out first thing in the morning. Rooms are filthy and disgusting with dirty curtains, torn bed sheets and cracked tiles in the bathroom. Toilet, sink and shower looked like they havent been cleaned in months, absolutely revolting!!!There is no wifi, room was very dark despite being advertised as ""full of natural light""  with tiny, ancient tv mounted on top of an old coupboard without remote control so we couldn't even reach it to switch it on. When we checked out despite telling at the reception that room wasn't as advertised, we were charged cancellation fee !!!Never seen anything like it before so please avoid like a plague!!!"
20,"This is the loudest hotel I’ve ever stayed at. Good luck sleeping. Doors slam at all hours of the night, the hotel staff walks about with walkie talkies on full volume all night, and the maids come by at 8am so if you manage to fall asleep at all you get woken up. They have bright lights on the sides of the hotel so the rooms are bright all night long, bring a sleep mask.I included a photo for reference that is 2am. (I usually take Americans reviews with a grain of salt because I’m an avid traveler and have stayed at some 1star/ 2star places but my god this was a disappointment )   The hotel is not on the beach as the photos indicate(catfish), there is a beach club which is a drive away from their hotel. The beach club is nice, but they also have it open to the public so anyone"
40,"My wife and I decided to make a spur of the moment visit to Puerto Escondido earlier this month. We selected Hotel Villasol as it seemed to be in the right price range, location and had availability. Checkin was very slow, even though the hotel didn’t seem overly crowded and it was almost 4PM before we had keys to a room. As excepted the room was small and tucked away at the end of a hall with no balcony and only 1 window. It was clean, had a working Tv and the beds were firm but comfortable. Breakfast was included in the morning and was not spectacular by any means, but good. The pool and surrounding area was very nice. Shaded with sufficient loungers and again, not busy. The highlight of this hotel in our opinion is the beach club. A short walk or shuttle van away. It was"
10,"I wish I could get a negative star to this hotel. I am outraged! I have stayed in this hotel 2 out of 9 nights in October 2021 and had to cancel our stay because of a funeral. The hotel agreed to cancel a reservation, promised to refund, asked to wait 15 days (it's their policy ) and now it is January 2022 and I am calling every day for weeks now to resolve this issue. One day a person tells me that the refund is approved and they need an email with my address for the refund to be wired. Many emails with all the information were sent. The next day nobody speaks English. The next day the person doesn't know anything about this situation. The next day I need to call back. The next day and the excuses are endless. Why is this so difficult? I made a mistake of not canceling with"
20,"There are more cons than pros about this place unfortunately. Nice amenities, good enough internet to have your video calls but it all gets ruined by customer service.  I've been here 4 times and got disappointed each time because they change rules and make you pay for it. There is no way you can track the rules either.  Initially I came here to relax and enjoy myself in a comfortable space.  Unfortunately everytime I tried to do this, one of their employees would come up to me and haggle me for one thing or another. First they let you in without buying a day pass but not using a pool. Second time they tell you can't do it and you in have to pay for the day pass. The day pass price changes on a daily basis whenever they want. Regardless, each time I have been there I spent over"
50,"The beaches of PE are splendid but we had our visits to Carizalillo and Manzanillo ruined by loud boom box music. There is nothing the restaurant owners there can or will do. This is why we spent 3 days at Villasol Beach club. Friendly staff, sparkling showers and bathrooms, beautiful grounds. If you are having lunch and a few drinks price is same as beach chairs on a rowdy public beach. Definitely worth it. Family friendly and tranquil. Class act! Thank you! "
50,"The hotel is located about 10 minutes walk (there is also a shuttelt that goes every 30 minutes) to the Bacocho beach where the hotel offers a fantastic beach club.  The hotel has simple rooms (make sure you reserve a refurbished room) and nice area with pool, but we spent almost all the time at the beach club and on the beack. The hotel is located in a calm area and the Bacocho beach is not crowded, very different from the crowded Zicatel area and beach."
20,The hotel itself is very nice. Pool area is great.  Now our room....I saw the hotel on an online travel site and the price was good so we had our taxi drop us off.  I asked the front desk how much for a room (I prefer to book directly with the hotel if possible) and she quoted me a price way higher than online.  So of course I sat down and booked the room online. I don't know if this irritated the staff because the room they gave us was not good. Room 514. 1. Bed is horrible. You can feel the springs.  Pillows were comfy.  2. Curtains are thin which is fine if you do not have a giant street light shining in the window directly onto the beds. 3. Loud vehicle traffic all night that would continually wake you up... if you managed to fall asleep.   The good about the room is the A/C
50,"We spend a month at hotel villasol to sit out quarantaine at home, so we worked from here while enjoying the beach and food here. I can’t imagine a better place to spend quarantaine: you’ve got your own cosy appartement with kitchen that is cleaned super well, the staff is super friendly and thinks along, you’ve got the best internet in town and an amazing beach club where I spend most of my time working with excellent sea-views, internet, food and lactose-free cappuccino. What better office than one where you see whales coming by and excellent food and drinks available at a fingertip?   Most of all, I got to know the people owning this place really well and they’re such lovely people who really care about the planet and people. They were the ones who started the daily turtle"
50,"Best internet in town! Really cute hotel with so many little details. The beach club is paradise, I recommend to watch the sunset here. Also check out the breakfast at pez gallo. Try to stay at 433 or 300s they are newer. The food is ok upstairs. Easy access to center"
20,"This hotel has SOOOOOOO MUCH POTENTIAL, it could easily become the best in Puerto Escondido but unfortunately it has so many flaws they should work ASAP before they are back on track.  The common areas are really nice, providing the experience of a cozy hut. The restaurant is out in the open next to the pool, and they bake fresh bread every morning. The staff is very kind but unfortunately the hotel rooms made things soooooo for my stay.  When I arrived, the toilete was leaking from underneath so I reported it to the lobby and they kindly upgraded my room to another one with view to the pool. Unfortunately the room's courtains were not able to cover the full window, and there was a minor stench in the room. We headed out in order to enjoy the beach but by the time we returned"
50,"There are no words to describe this place and what you experience when you stay there. Facilities and amenities are beautiful, perfect pool even the one located private in the room. Staff is great, good service and very lovely people, perfect place to take some days of relax in the pacific, 100% recommended. Casona Sofrza is a MUST when you visit Puerto Escondido."
50,Our 2 nights stay at the Casona Sforza was a dream.  First the hotel architecture is beautiful. We were lucky to get the room 11 (which is a bit away from the other rooms) The room is beautiful and bed very confortable.  The staff was very lovely and very attentive all the time. We were also so lucky to experience a turtle laying her eggs next to us.  The beach in front of the hotel is empty and the beds and hamacs just perfect for the amazing sunset. Lastly the food at the restaurant is very tasty. Breakfast is also great. I would return there in a heartbeat!
50,"Entering the space feels like coming into a new world. It feels like a secret you and only a few others know of. The staff is glorious, they are friendly and highly attentive. The salt water pool transports your senses as you float. The food is brilliant, the cuisine takes you on a cultural journey through the pre colonial past that delights all senses. I could spend a lifetime by the pool drinking signature cocktails. The hotel is also right on the beach and it’s very private and serene. I can’t recommend visiting enough!  cheers"
50,"The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.We spent the day at their salt water pool ,had a fantastic pre colonial lunch very Oaxaca . The grounds were beautiful and clean a top notch resort in my book . I will return Thank you Ivan and your wonderful staff."
50,"Off the beaten track on an endless stretch of Oaxacan beach, Casona Sforza offers the constant backdrop of the Pacific Ocean crashing on the shore line, saltwater pools, wonderful staff and the simply stunning and thoughtful architecture of Alberto Kalach. As one can expect of an Eco property, electricity can drop on the odd occasion, wifi is not turned up to 11 all over the place (thankfully) and not everything is served within 5 seconds of ordering. It’s a wonderful place to come to unwind - not to endlessly work/post or ‘be busy’. With just 9 accommodations (pool suites on ground level, ocean suites above) it’s a quiet and secluded stay. The longer, the better. Enjoy."
50,"Had such a wonderful time at Casona Sforza. Every single person working there was so kind - brought tea to my room when I wasn't feeling well, kept us hydrated by the pool, was always coming by to see if we needed anything. The hotel itself is gorgeous -we absolutely loved it."
30,"It is a nice hotel but needs quite some work in order to become a luxury hotel. Wifi comes and goes, so does electricity and water. Not acceptable for a hotel which charges 600$ a night. Staff is very friendly but you need to keep on repeating the order to multiple people as they forget or change tables etc. In general, does not meet expectations of a luxury hotel. Hotel Escondido is still a much better choice"
50,"My friend and I had an incredible time at this hotel. The architecture is stunning, the service was phenomenal, the food was well crafted with local ingredients, and the beach felt like where you might go when you die if you have lived a good life.   The staff were genuine in their kindness and the quality of their recommendations for our trip in Oaxaca were unparalleled in meaning and significance.   The journey to the hotel is rugged and winding which in my opinion sets the stage for the beautiful fever dream you are about to experience. By all means, go."
20,This place looks gorgeous but unfortunately it’s style without the substance. The staff appear to be very attentive but in reality were very slow (had to wait 25 minutes for a glass of wine) and one member of staff was quite rude. We also asked for a vegetarian option and was told that a dish with pork was vegetarian but thankfully didn’t eat it before it was too late. The food was over priced (west London prices but without the quality to back it up).
30,"Went to eat at the restaurant as it was recommended to us by a friend. When we got there we had great first impressions, the hotel is beautiful and the drinks were delicious but unfortunately we did not have a good experience overall. Our food was over priced and the menu was largely international (Italian, sushi, burger etc) but the taste was disappointing. Then to make matters worse the staff bullied us into leaving a bigger tip than we wanted to (we were going to leave 12% and he demanded 15%). We came away feeling a bit robbed."
40,"Spent 3 nights at Nomad as a couple and it was overall a pleasant stay. It's nice and quiet and the room was clean. The room could be improved with a few more hooks and shelves, other than that we were very happy. The barman and lady with the short hair, and the French lady were very helpful and went out their way to make sure we had what we needed and could get around. Thank you! One tip - do the dolphin tours Robert (Robert's ecotours on TripAdvisor) - was a real highlight as we got to snorkel with 100s of dolphins. Memories we will have forever."
50,"When we planned our trip to Puerto Escondido, we didn’t want an “Acapulco” area. The Nomad offers a a basic and clean accommodation which is located close to the Playa Principal and Playa Zicatela.  The kitchen made us a healthy breakfast each morning for an extra charge. There are also sun beds and umbrellas available for hostel guests to use. You can also order food and drink there as well. Ricardo will help you on the beach.  The staff were super friendly and very helpful to ensure our visit ran smoothly. Our rooms were cleaned every day with fresh towels.  The only thing that could be improved on would be adding a safe in each room. Despite Opodo advertising there was one on their website, there wasn’t one when we arrived.  Many thanks to Barbara, Fernando and all the staff"
50,Really enjoyed my week long stay here! Less than a minute walk to the beach and a 5 minute walk to Zicatela beach. Barbara made us feel very welcome and invited us out with her many times for dinner and drinks around the town to many restaurants and beaches.  Nice chilled bar at the hostel with Fernando the evening bartender always up for a chat. Thanks for everything guys and all the best! 😁
50,Stayed for a week. Excellent breakfast available  virtually all morning . Packed breakfast available if on an early morning excursion. Very helpful staff who would take you down to the Beautiful  beach bar at a moments notice.  Towels available for the beach.  Very good value. Would definitely return. 
40,"This hostel is close  to beaches and bus station, with a nice little kitchen and garden facilities, staff are willing to help you, the only thing I wished for was charging points on top bunks otherwise quite good stay here. "
50,"Adjacent to the Santa Fe Hotel this was a really nice stay.Huge, clean Bungalows with AC. Very mexican style. Everything is a little dated but worked fine. We had a lovely terrace with ocean view. The Bungalows share a pool. But there are more in the main building. Wonderful Restaurant with both- good food and views. We will be back !"
30,"I wanted to give the Bungalows Santa Cruz a better rating, but just couldn't do it.  Positives:  great location, just steps from Zicatela Beach, ATM, small grocery store, fun beach restaurants.  Cute bungalow, but we pay for apartments and bungalows in order to eat in for breakfast, and sometime lunch and/or dinner.  Our room, R3 was upstairs (which I recommend because of the better beach views.)  It is across the street from the beach, and the car/truck traffic can be pretty loud.  In the kitchen, we had 1 kitchen knife, that had the end broken off:  unusable.  No paper towels, no hand towels, just a couple of glasses and dishes, no spices, but we did have lots of ants in the kitchen.  Big ones and small ones.  Also, the bed is rock hard and every night my husband and I were"
40,"First time in Mexico, stayed at this place. It became my favorite place.   Spacious room, best location. Very clean. Vegetarian food is amazing and their breakfasts are delicious.  Location is amazing, just in front of the beach."
40,"This was my first time in Puerto Escondido and I must say staying at this hotel made all the difference.  Most commendable about the hotel is its excellent restaurant. After heading out to the various beach palapa restaurants and being ripped-off with bad food and terrible service, we had dinner at the hotel restaurant once and never looked back! Food was well-priced, the menu varied – with an amazing vegetarian selection (unheard of in Mexico) – and every dish we sampled was absolutely delicious.  The bungalows are not bungalows at all but rather a kind of house with 4 apartments. That said, each has a very private feel and has a pleasant terrace with table, chairs and hammock. There is a very nice pool in leafy surroundings with sun-loungers. The apartment itself is spacious"
50,"I have for many years on spent a week or two with family and freind over Christmas at the Santa Cruz Bungalows and always enjoyed it very much. There are only eight bungalows, four in every building so you don´t see the neighbours much. The pool is nearly always alone since many take to the beach or one of the two pools in the Santa Fe Hotel right next to it. I prefer the bungalow pool since it is not as warm as the other pools, it is just perfect for cooling you down. We would have a light meal in the bungalow and vegetarian food at the restaurant in the Hotel. If you want to vary there are plenty of places around. I highly recomend it for couples and families."
50,"It is so clean, it has a good location , close from the surf point. Big rooms. And also the food is really good. The vegetarian food is tasty !! I really had  a great time staying at bungalows Santa Cruz !!!"
30,My husband and I stayed for many years at the Bungalows Santa Cruz.  We enjoyed having the privacy of our own swimming pool and kitchen but still having all the amenities of the main hotel.  The restaurant is one of the best in Puerto and for sure has one of the best vistas of the ocean.  The location is very central and you can access the beaches quite easlily. I know you will enjoy your stay there. Ana
10,"Santa Fe/Santa Cruz.  We made a booking through DHR for a Junior Suite in the Santa Fe Hotel only to find that we were given a room in the adjacent Santa Cruz Bungalows, managed by the same Reception Desk.  Only the next morning were we to realise that the responsibility for what turned out to be, to us, considerable discomfort lay with DHR who had also charged us for the Junior Suite in the Santa Fe whilst allocating to the Santa Cruz.  This assessment, therefore, relates to the Santa Cruz Bungalows.  In a word, our room C4 was a dump. Very warn and very smelly.We were suspicious that the source of the smell could have been leaking gas from the 4 ring gas cooker and this turned out to be the case with the result that we were moved to room C2. Rubbish already in bins, electrical"
40,"Respecto a mi estancia en PAZIFLORA HOSTEL - Puerto Escondido (México) durante el mes de Noviembre de 2020 puedo decir que..  La calidad precio en estancia de HD en habitación compartida - Hostel ha sido excelente.  Destacar el patio con la vegetación y los árboles frutales y por supuesto, la habitación. Tambien el trato, es un host local y familiar.   La ubicación bien y el personal local que lo regenta muy bien.   Valorando la habitación y los baños puedo decir que excelente. No facilitan toalla pero si buena ropa de cama. La habitación, super limpia y organizada, con súper colchón, luz individual, buen baño dentro de la habitación.   No se exige fianza por llave.   No realizan actividades y no ofrecen tours.   El WiFi es correcto y otros servicios o cuestiones que reseñar es"
50,"Gracias que dimos con este maravilloso hostel. Desde que contactamos, todo fue mejor de lo que esperamos. Llegamos a las 00:20 de la noche a la estación que queda bastante cerca, pero aun así se acercaron a recogernos para no tener que ir andando cargados, un detallazo. Las habitaciones están limpisimas, las sábanas también, el baño de la habitación también, en conclusión, está todo muy limpio! Dispone de un patio donde puedes relajarte en sus hamacas, comer mangos del arbol o incluso cocinarte. El desayuno está compuesto por café, fruta variada pelada y tostadas. El trato es lo más destacable del lugar, ya que son maravillosos todos los que trabajan ahí.  Sin dudarlo volveremos y lo recomendaremos a todo el mundo."
50,"El hostal es pequeño pero muy bonito, las habitaciones están súper limpias y los baños también. La dueña es un encanto, nos ayudó en todo lo posible. El patio es el sitio perfecto para relajarse y preparar una cena. Totalmente recomendable!!"
30,"TYPE OF TRIP: Great place to stay if your boyfriend/husband surfs.  Waves are right in front of this hotel.  Lots of other side trips where he can surf, just an hour or two away via car.  I found ways to exercise while he surfed.  Early runs on the beach and exercise in the pool. There is a yoga studio in town - daily classes which was another option.  FOOD IN TOWN: Tons of eating options - delicious burrito place on the main drag and good Spinach and Cheese pastries at Cafecito restaurant.  The Italian restaurant at the end of the street is some of the best quality food in this beach town.  ROOM/FACILITIES: Rooms where simple, a bit run down but if you can get a room with a balcony overlooking the ocean, it's worth it.  Beds where comfy and big.  Sheets had some holes in them"
10,"Rude staff, poor breakfast, I had a wash bag stolen with £300 cash inside it. I would not recommend this hotel. Room wasn’t cleaned often enough. The pool area is dirty. Overall very poor. The AC ineffective and noisy."
10,"While in Puerto Escondido we stayed at 3 different properties, this was by far the most expensive and worst.  It was unclean, ripped pillow cases, grime build up around the taps, the sheets didn't fit the mattress, the bathroom wall was incplete exposing the inner wiring of the wall, I showered in flip flops it was so dirty. While there my mum stood in glass in the room, they said it had come out the air conditioning unit (which we hadn't used at that stage).   We added breakfast to our booking because we were volunteering at a local animal shelter in the mornings, it was never ready by 7am as advertised (or even 7.30am).  If you are considering this property I would suggest looking at Hotel Rockaway in Zicatela which is clean, well maintained with great facilities."
50,"My girlfriend's sister recommended we stay at Caracol Plaza when we visited Puerto Escondido so I booked the trip online and when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel staff.  I felt as if I was at the Ritz Carlton with the service we experienced.  After checking in I took my girlfriend to the restaurant for something to eat for dinner.  Had a great time there as well, the head waiter Salvador was great and the food was delicious.  BTW.....this hotel has to have the best views in Puerto Escondido of Zicatela beach, (out of this word type view) I noticed the head chef, Daniel Ortiz,  was very attentive to the food delivery and after we had finished the meal he came over to introduce himself.  I really can't say enough about his food quality and its presentation 5"
30,"Room key kept on not working, despite being no where near my iPhone - not once but on 4 different days.  One time they changed the lock without telling me.  Dirty corridors - liquids spilled t and not cleaned up.  Noisy with music coming up from town venues until 04:00., as well, a lot of traffic noise from highway below hotel  Pool area not kept clean.  With a little bit of effort by management, it could be a nice hotel.  Don't expect reception to know any English."
10,"- One of the reasons to rent a room in a hotel is the wifi. In this case the wifi did not work none of the 7 days I was there. - Rooms are made from time to time and not every day - Some days there was not hot water - There are private parties making noise until late, so you can hardly rest - Towels are not changed everyday - The doors keys failed several times, they even changed door locks - Breakfast is uncompleted, sometimes they don't have bread or butter  "
20,I was literally the only person staying at the hotel. The rooms were ok at best and the location a loooong walk from the best area of pe.....I checked out after night one after realizing that their wifi was almost nonexistent even after I'd changed rooms. The people running the hotel seemed quite nice.
10,"This hotel was horrible!! It is not even finished and there was construction going on all night long. It is also on the highway so you have to cross the 6 lane coastal highway to get to town. Also, the noise from the highway was unbearable along with the all night booming dance music coming from a local nightclub. The service was so bad and the hotel was not clean - we had to ask constantly for the hot water to be turned on and the outside hall lights to be on as well. The manager is the only one who speaks english and was nowhere to be found. I would never stay here not only because it is not finished, dirty and has no hot water but because it does not feel safe. Beware -"
50,Best price per value. Pay for a 3 star hotel and got 4 star service. The restaurant next door is amazing. Very nice quality meat and good Argentinean sides. The empanada is flavourful and is presented in a really nice way. Really recommended
10,"Ok, so the Pool area is nice, if nothing fancy. And the beds are reasonably comfortable. Had this been your basic $45 Mexican hotel, I’d give it a couple of extra stars. But I paid more than double this, and for such prices, there are certain things that this very well traveled writer has come to expect.  Towel racks in the bathroom, for example.  Or a toilet paper holder. Or lights that consisted of a bit more than bare bulbs. The room was not very clean, nor well furnished. The decor (in Oaxaca!!!) was nothing more than two small pictures from what appears to have been a garage sale. The ‘kitchen’ was a rusting two-burner hot plate and a frigobar, plus a few implements.   There was a coffee maker, but no coffee. In fact, there was no drinking water!!!  The WiFi is unreliable"
40,This was our first time staying at Hotel Acuario and we were pleasantly surprised. We were given an extremely good rate due to it being low season and we stayed for 12 nights. The room was very simple but had an excellent air conditioner (a must in Puerto at any time of the year) and a sizeable  balcony with a great view of the beach. We could certainly check the surf conditions anytime.    It is a little noisy with Kabbalah directly opposite but that's only on weekends during low season. The rest of the time it was fine.  The pool was a great place to cool off in the afternoons as Zicatella is too dangerous for swimming.   The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for its convenient location and great price. It's everything you need
40,"I stayed here for 22 days in February. Note that the hotel is under new management and they are working on many improvements and updates, so some comments from previous years may be outdated/no longer applicable.  Pluses = Staff were wonderful...friendly, polite, helpful, always hardworking. Location great...right on center of main strip in town surrounded by many restaurants and shops with an OXXO (corner store) right next door and and ATM (Santandor Bank) just a few minute walk away). Pool was refreshing and kept clean, hotel was kept spotless with daily room cleaning, free access to beach loungers and umbrellas across the street at the hotel restaurant. I stayed in room 35 (2nd floor poolside) which was good for noise reduction due to it's location a bit away from the street"
50,"Thank you so much for your hospitality, more than being in a hotel we felt like being at home. Huge thanks to Alex, Miranda and excellent manager. Definitely coming back in the future. All the best  Pavla"
40,"Location is the important thing here, right across the street from the beach. Wonderful ocean views from the balcony and very Mexican in design. There is a small kitchen with a fridge and decent size balcony. The rooms and hallways seem dark and a little worn. The host, Peter will go out of his way to help you."
50,"Best place to stay on Playa Zicatela. Check out the huts in the back past the pool for a great Puerto experience. While I have never been in the hotel, I have stayed in these huts several times.Cant beat the location, and when Zicatela gets hot in the late afternoon, the pool is steps away from the street."
40,I particularly liked the location across from the beach and the fact that you could sit in the restaurants lounging chairs facing the water which was included with the room cost.  On the weekends the pool was overrun with children of all ages and their parents.  I didn't mind this so much but it made using the pool less desirable.  My room was quite nice - it was in the upper level and faced the pool.  A ceiling fan was adequate to keep the air circulating.   I would suggest earplugs for the noise from both the pool and other guests.  One night a very loud party went on until 3:30AM - screaming outside my door woke me up at which time I finally called down to the front desk.  They immediately took care of the problem but I wondered why they hadn't acted earlier.   One complaint
40,"We have stayed here quite a few times over the years.  The staff is always friendly and will help with anything you need.  Rooms are big and clean.  Nothing fancy but who cares!  You'll be at the beach anyway!   Beachview rooms have balconies but it does get noisy late at night sometimes with the music and extremely ""happy"" people walking out front.  The pool is nice but not very big.  All in all, I would recommend this hotel highly. :)"
50,Great little hotel on the beach!  Really good value.  Hot water - even though we didn't need it.  Some rooms have air conditioning.  Good full service restaurant on premises. Excellent staff.  Clean basic room and comfortable beds. Highly recommend.
30,"I was inclined to give this a poor rating but this is unfair as it does have some things going for it, but, in my opinion, these are all outweighed by the architecture. The place is noisy and although I stayed there during the low season, not many people staying in the hotel, it was still noisy and I got about 3-4 hours sleep. There are 3 grades of room and I went for the mid-priced option with ceiling fan. This was a cabaña near the swimming pool which was clean, had a good shower and would have slept up to 6 people. Because the climate is so hot the rooms in the cabañas do not have glass windows but instead only have meshing to keep the mosquitoes out, and this seems like a good idea until other guests return from the various bars and clubs along the beach from 1 a.m. onwards."
40,"Stayed there this December 2017 and much to my surprise, the discos had disappeared.  It was SO NICE and quiet.  The maids are still the sweetest.  The hotel is super clean and is right on the beach.  The restaurant-bar serves great food and Alfredo, the bartender at night, is a cutie, super efficient with a great sense of humour even tough his English is limited, understands foreigners.  Get an air conditioned room if you can. The prices haven't changed in many years and are affordable."
40,It doesn't look like much from the street but once inside you realize you are right on the beach. On site bar and restaurant. Super helpful and friendly staff. In the evenings a full on market right out the front door.  The only down side to this hotel is that if you arrive by car the parking is about 6 blocks away at another hotel owned by the same fellow.
40,"Love the maids.  Super kind, friendly and helpful.  Nice basic, clean rooms with fan or air conditioning.  A few guests stay for months during the winter and find it a great little community.  Downside is the many discos on the same street which are REALLY loud, and I mean it. Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights are noisy.  They run until 5 am, especially the open rooftop disco on Saturdays.  It really pounds.  Vibrates the hotel.   Earplugs won't help.  Businesses have tried to have the volume lowered because they are losing patronage.  Disco guy won't cooperate.  If you want a quieter sleep, you're better off at the sister hotel Barlovento up the hill across the water.  But you will still hear the pounding bass sound of the disco! 24-hour security at both hotels."
40,"Very basic hotel, but can't beat the view and location. Clean room with a fan, tv, comfortable beds and a georgous view of the Playa Principal beach. We left our door cracked open when we were in our room so we could hear and watch the waves. Every morning my husband would get up and go down to the beach and visit with the local fisherman. One morning we bought fresh fish and took it to a local restaurant that cooked it for us!   Some negatives, but keep in mind this is common in the little hotels on the Oaxacan coast. Very small thin towels are provided for bathing with a personal size soap. No screens on the windows but they secured tight enough to where we weren't bothered with any bugs or mosquitos.   We definitely try to stay here each time we visit, but due to pricing"
50,"This hotel has a small street frontage and can be easily missed yet it has many rooms and it's rear faces the beach.  It is a spartan hotel yet clean, comfortable, and price is reflective.  It has central location in the fishing village of Playa Principal and many shops and restaurants located a few meters away. Most nights the street in front of hotel is closed and vendors move onto the street to sell food, etc.  Real pleasant atmosphere and substantially different than Zicatela although Playa Zicatela is about a 500 meter walk on the beach or a five minute taxi ride.  I stayed over a week here and found I wanted for nothing.  Very nice and helpful staff.  I will return here when I visit P.E. again."
40,Friendly staff nice clean room. Recommended to go here. Bit older people than in other places. Good beds as well. Price is a bit high for the location maybe. The staff takes care of the hotel which means less privacy 
40,"I stayed here for a week and enjoyed it. Here are my thoughts:  I first stayed in the cheapest room possible: PROs:   -cheap, like...$25/night room + private bathroom -very friendly and accommodating staff -best location on the strip among the souvenir booths, stores, restaurants, and clubs (I thought this area was much better than the popular Zicatela tourist strip 5 min away) -tiled, private bathroom -two large Windows, partial ocean view -beachfront property, located in front of the marina within full view of the principal beach in PE with large rolling waves. Beautiful.  -located at the bottom of the hill where the rest of ""town"" away from the tourist zone begins (cheaper restaurants and shops are always found outside the tourist strip). A short 5 min walk away. -10-20 min"
40,"This is a great location on the beach. It's not on the best beach for swimming, but rather the fishing beach. It was also right by the Garza strip with a nightly market- fun place to walk around. Small grocery store/farmacy nearby and plenty of restaurants. The price was right, and it was cool watching the fishing boats do in and out every day. There were a lot of interesting bird noises as well. If you want something really quiet, this may not be the best place, as there is a nearby club that played music until late on Saturday night and there were kids playing soccer until midnight or families having parties. However, this is part of the Mexican culture and it was fun to see (and with ear plugs I was able to sleep). The rooms were cleaned nicely. We were a couple, and they"
50,"The price was great and the staff was amazing! A perfect location, as well. The courtyard was a prefect place for and afternoon beverage. Head out one direction to the main street and the restaurants and the other, right onto the beach. Lots of good fun with the staff."
50,"Nice place in the middle of the zicatele.  You hear some music noise at night, but actually not nearly as noisy as I expected.   Rooms are basic, but adequate.  Shower was hot.  All was clean.  No bugs,yay!! (Ya never know, lol!). Location is great.  I had a room on the first floor with a terrace facing the street.   It was great!  Shout out to Israel the security guy for offering helpful information and restaurant recommendations.  They do have security all night too!   Lastly the pool was great.   I would certainly stay there again."
40,"when we stayed there, you get internet only in a few locations away from our room and the connections were not good....rooms great, location great, parking great...we really hope they wii connect the rooms soon...we won't stay there again until they do..."
40,"Very lovely hotel with good friendly staff at the best location of Puerto Escondido. I enjoyed a lot having my breakfast at the restaurant that has a first row view over the bay. I went there every morning. We traveled with a 2 year old and were a bit afraid for the noise of the bars nearby, but we didn't hear a thing and slept very well every night. The only downside was that our room didn`t had wifi. Apparently only the rooms near the restaurant got wifi, but with the sea at 100 steps, who needs internet :).  Will definitely go back again."
40,"WE have been staying at the Arco Iris for at least 25 years,  Yes things have changed, NO MORE DO WE HEAR THE WAVES! Music has taken over.  Ear Plugs are a necessity. The Hotel though quaint is still charming and so many of us return, the service is wonderful. The help are our friends and work so hard to please each guest and see to your needs.  If you are looking for upscale frills do not go to Puerto Escondido.. There are fancy rentals aways from the action Food is very good in PE, Cafe Paris is up scale , so are many of the others and of course we old timers always head to the Flor de Maria for Joanne 's home style cooking when we need a taste of home.  We love the friends we have made in PE the warmth of the locals. it is still our home away for 3 weeks each January. The"
40,"This hotel was one of the first built in Puerto, so it is not a modern hotel  and fits right in the relaxed mood of Puerto. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It has a great swimming pool and the restaurant offers a lovely view of the ocean, plus room service.  There are rooms with a balcony overlooking the view of the waves. There is no elevator, so don't try it if you have weak knees.  "
30,"I expect that in the 80s and 90s this was a happening place, but alas things and owners have changed....perhaps too many times.  The views are wonderful, the staff remain attentive and the rooms are clean, but the pool is missing tiles, the paint in the rooms is tired and the classic Mexican  furniture is scuffed.  You can see all this going in, but what you need to know can't be seen ..... the BOOM BOOM BOOM of the base of the bars across the road and down the strip and the oppressive heat that the ceiling fans cannot move is something that one must adjust to (cools down around midnight).  In three nights we did manage to, but really would have preferred not to have had to.    Our room looked directly out towards the beach and was located in the main building in the lower"
30,"We stayed comfortably at this formerly charming hotel for 15 years. Loved it!  And then a new regime came in and changed everything . . . even the paint. (White is a ""young color""?)  The hotel is now stark white and looks nothing like these photos.  Have not seen the rooms in the last year - they may be white now too.  We understand most of the staff are still there so that's a good thing at least.  Food is mediocre, except breakfasts which are outstanding and the open-air restaurant overlooks the surfing beach. For some, Zicatela is the place to be. If you want quiet, this is not for you. Zicatela Beach is full of palapas - some illegal - and clubs serving free booze with crazy rap 'music' thumping on into the wee hours. Make sure they confirm your rate before you arrive. In"
30,"We were supposed to stay at the Arco Iris for a whole week and we left after the first night, in which we couldn't sleep because of the loud music of a rock concert held on a place steps away from the hotel.  It certainly is well located, but everything is close in Puerto Escondido, so you don't need to be in the middle of that chaos, if you're looking for a peaceful vacation.  Rooms are just ok, decoration is deplorable, service at the restaurant is very very slow.  Conclusion: there are better places for the same rate."
30,The location is good since you are right across the street from the ocean and all the bars and nightlife in Puerto Escondido if that is what you are looking for. The rooms are clean but take your own towel. There are hammocks in the pool are facing the ocean which is good. Gets pretty hot at night though in those rooms.
40,"I spent a week March 9-15 at the Arco Iris.  I was warmly welcomed by Rebecca when I arrived.  I had a lovely room up on the top le vel of the resort view... Phenomenal - Stairs up and down not so much.  But it gave me my daily exercise.  I had a full fridge and a coffee maker in my room along with filtered water.  The bed was not as comfortable as my bed at home but I still had a restful sleep each night.  Sitting out on the balcony watching the sun come up or go down was glorious.  I had breakfast each morning, fresh fruit tea toast and juice.  But the restaurant did have a full menu each meal of the day.  The ""boys"" took great care of me when I was hungry or thirsty for that matter.  My room was always very clean and I always had clean towels.  I spent several afternoons"
40,"I was so happy to spend a whole week a this little villa! the room was big enough for a family of four... clean, fresh towels and sheets everyday and are AC running and cooling the whole unit. The lady in charged and a young man took care of everything for 4 families that in the midst of the Covid-19 era traveled there with kids. Fabulous location a block of great restaurants, little store and the steps of Carrizalillo Beach... and abet more than a kilometer away of Puerto Angelito and Manzanillo Beaches... you'll love it!"
30,"We spent a few weeks here and there are pros and cons about the place.  First many of the guest return year after year and are a great bunch.  They have an awesome palapa on the 4th floor with amazing views of the sunset and happy hour starts at 5.30 pm.  On occasion the guest get together for appies as well.  The location is great, just across the street are many restaurants.  The pool area is a nice spot but the water is on the cool side and the pools chairs are covered in duct  tape and need replacing.  The rooms come with a kitchen but are poorly equipped.  You should consider bringing your own frying pans, cutting knives & board, etc.  They have lots of plates, cups, a few forks, spoons and butter knives but that is it, after that it is hit and miss.  The fridges are in"
10,"We had reservations for 4 nights, arrived at 6 pm and apparently there was a problem with the room already for 3 days and the manager did not remove it from the site. Luckily the receptionist, Angel, took us to another place for only 1 night and picked us up again in the morning and took us to another hotel! The manager never apologized to us and Angel was an angel ! "
30,"First, the many positives!. The staff was very friendly and amazingly accommodating. We had an early flight out the next morning. The man at the front desk who checked us in actually came in two hours earlier than he needed to the next day to call us a cab. If that is not above and beyond I don't know what is! I was super grateful for this kindness. After check- in, I wanted to see one of the larger family suites for future trips, and he was happy to show us one.  His English was much better than my Spanish, and he was very kind about this.  The hotel has a spectacular 4th floor shared palapa with wonderful views of the ocean and plenty of room to relax, eat take-out, or just enjoy a cerveza. The pool on the 1st floor is small but big enough to cool off in, clean, and the tiled"
40,"This hotel is at the same time close to everything and far enough to be quiet.  Set on a small side street but two minutes from all the restaurants and 300 meters from the beach, it has the ideal location. You can rent a studio, 1 or 2 bedroom apartment.  All come with a complete small kitchen, with a coffee maker, toaster and blender (upon request).  Anything is available except dish soap. There is a huge terrace on the roof perfect for late afternoon drinks and a small pool on the ground floor. The staff is really nice and helpful. There is an internet connection for each floor so it's important to verify if you're connected to the right floor.  It is the perfect spot for a short or long term stay (they have monthly rates)."
40,"This is a quiet hotel with attractive and comfortable rooms.  Our room had 2 beds as requested, a kitchen and eating area, and tv.  There is a pool on the main level and a lovely rooftop area with comfortable seating for just one or several people. There are good places to eat within easy walking distance and it is only a short taxi ride into the village where there are even more wonderful eating spots and a great market! The staff are friendly and helpful.  It would be helpful if there was a kettle and coffee maker provided in the kitchen."
40,"We were going to go with just a standard budget/mid-range hotel in Puerto Econdido but then stumbled upon Quinta Carrizalillo Villas, and decided to go with them because it was a full suite with kitchen and living/dining area. Puerto Escondidio isn't really a walkable city due to its layout having multiple beaches and then different areas centered around those beaches, and then the local area across the main highway. Therefore, we thought it would be best to have a kitchen and cook our own meals rather than search out hotels (there's a Super Che nearby for groceries which is similar to Walmart). This hotel is in the Playa Carrizalillo area, and actually just located across the street from the stairs down to that beach. It has an outdoor pool area which was lovely, and a rooftop"
30,"The pros - great location across from Carrizalillo Beach.  Delicious eats in restaurants across the road and just a quick $25 MXN cab ride to Playa Principal.  Very clean room, comfortable and spacious.  Beautiful pool area and lovely and large rooftop palapa area.  Good value.   The cons - advertised balcony was a joke, no room for even one chair,  kitchen was spacious but not equipped with much beyond 2 pans and dinnerware.  No kitchen linens, dish soap, coffee maker, bottle opener, etc.  Staff was impersonal - surprising in a country where warm and helpful service seems the norm."
50,"got a 5 person suite that was very very nice at the last minute. the front desk guy was extremely nice and friendly. it's a bit off the main drag of the bars (playa zicatela) but is about a 10 minute drive, and this is right by the entrance to a lovely, small, secluded beach - carrizalilo."
50,"This hotel may not have the hype of its neighbours in Puerto Escondido but trust me, it is well worth a stay. Literally across the road from the steps to Carrizalillo Beach (best swimming and beginner surfing and cervezas) and a ton of cafes. Gets you out of the grimy European-traveler-in-wooly-hat-even-though-it's-100-degrees vibe of Zicatella and puts you in a more chill area with good people. Our host Coila was SUPER friendly and her recommendations for things to do and places to eat were on point 100%. Clean comfortable rooms and an amazing sunset view from the roof, even better than some of the supposed 'best' spots to see it. Even the cleaning lady is awesome. Do it!"
20,"Pros Very friendly and helpful staff   Good location if you like Zicatela   Decent breakfast   Cons   Noise - Difficult to sleep as the room was literally shaking from the booming music opposite.   In fairness we were kindly moved rooms on request to the one furthest away from the front which helped.   Woke up at 7am sharp to the continual sound of a hammer tap and power tools. This went on all morning until we left.   General cleanliness -towel had a brown smear on it and the flush in the toilet didn't work at all.   Rather than a hotel, its more like a hostel. Very expensive for what it is as its really just a very basic room."
50,"This was a good find for a reasonable price located in the center of zicatela.  This was a great place to stay for the first time because it was centrally located in Puerto Escondido. Staff was super friendly, room was clean.  The A/C worked AND I had hot water!  The bed was comfortable too.  The breakfast was delicious.  I would stay here again.  The wi-fi works intermittently, but that is the norm for PE.  The hotel also has a property on the beach directly across the street which also had great food!  I would stay here again.  Thank you "
50,"Amazing place for a short or longer stay, you will feel like you're at your own home. The service is perfect, the food is excellent, you have your room cleaned every single day and also the option of breakfast included in Bungalows Zicatela or at their beach bar Cana Brava. Also the place to be if you want to be in the front of one of the world's best waves!"
50,Relaxed easy going hotel suitable for families or couples. Lovely friendly staff. Brilliant location and the breakfast is incredible. Highly recommend! Nice rooms with a decent size fridge. Two pools and a babies pool to chill out and relax by.
50,"We stay here as a couple and bring friends every time we come to Puerto. We love it because #1 - they accept pets and are very pet friendly! I can eat breakfast with my pup on my lap and can swim in the pool while my pup sits in the shade! What more can I ask for? A drink, you say? You can order fresh fruit smoothies all day long if you like and they have a great menu, large portion sizes and good prices!   It is always very clean and the rooms are comfortable with great beds and we have always had hot water, great AC and good internet. Many hotels along the coast say they have hot water and internet, but once you get to your room-it is not the case. Bungalows Zicatela has met our expectations every time. The staff is kind and always helpful! And every time we stay, the staff"
20,"Nice staff and good breakfast. Pool nice but only very limited sun beds. Room quality is below what you expect for the price.  Overall the main very bad thing is the extrem loud noise of the surrounding clubs, bars etc! Especially the nice sea view = street facing rooms where you pay even a premium for!!! Yes you chose this hotel for the location close to the street but their own bar/club (Caña Brava) as well as the ones next door make an extreme loud music that makes it impossible to have a relax, constant sleep! We woke up so often that it was not relaxing at all. Strong bass sounds until 3:00/4:0@ in the morning.  We were offered another room (less facing the street) which was quite dark and not what we expected for a holiday. Then the confirmed that there is no noise"
40,"We arrived and was immediately concerned because there was no safe in the room and the window did not lock.  Carolina handled the situation well and put us in a different room!  Be careful taking ""white items"" I took a white wash cloth for my face and the maid accidentally took it with the bedding.  The same thing happened with my white rash guard.  I did not get the rash guard back but they did end up paying me $35 to replace it.  So all in all was good!"
40,"This hotel has it all. Perfect location in the middle of Playa Zicatela. The breakfasts are huge and delicious. The a/c in the rooms works great. Plenty of pool space, although they can get kind of murky by afternoon for some reason. The desk staff was very friendly. Definitely staying here again."
50,"This hotel is probably one of the best on the Zicatela strip. The staff are extremely friendly and kind and our housekeeper was the sweetest woman. They really make you feel at home here. The rooms are spacious, ocean view is an absolute must being that the sunsets here are the most incredible thing you’ll ever see. The pool is large and there are lots of areas to lay down and soak up the sun. There’s a nice restaurant downstairs in the main area and also across the street (they are connected somehow) which we had breakfast at every morning as it was included in our stay.   Overall I have nothing but good things to say about this place and will return next time I’m in PE. "
50,"Three couples have just returned from a two week vacation at this hotel! We are all planning on returning next year already! The staff are so accommodating, the rooms are large and we all had king size beds in our room. My husband and I had a jacuzzi suite with spectacular ocean view! An amazing breakfast was included in our room price and the pool area was lovely!  The front desk was so helpful and none of us can think of one thing to complain about!"
50,"We just love it perfect for relax really not expensive and great food and service,  the have restaurant with really good service and food, they made to order everything  great seafood  people have the feeling of service they recommend everything to go to visit, inclusive great places to eat and visit lagoons and beaches  the rooms are great and clean really safe  try to call directly to make your reservation  they do not accept credit card, but really cheap"
10,In November we saw the great reviews for Las Hadas in tripadvisor and we decided to spend 5 days of vacation at this resort. We had many emails with the sales person of Las Hadas and as the information and service of this person was very exceptionnal we were sure that we might have booked the perfect vacation. We asked to prepay 50% and should have paid the rest early January 2009.  On January 7 we received a mail from the sales person and he asked not to make anymore payments as there would be some trouble at Las Hadas. On January 13 we received an email of a person who told us that she was the daughter of the owners and she warned us not to make any payments to the sales person as they ended the relationship to this man more than one month ago. She told us that he stole money
50,"We just return from a trip though whole Mexico. We were a group of 15 people from 11 different countries and wanted to connect real Mexico, culture, adventure and history. After a trip from Cancun via Merida, Campeche, Veracruz, then some days in Mexico City we wanted the relaxing part to happen at Las Hadas in teh State of Oaxaca and we cannot imagine that there would have been any better choice. If you grow up and live in Mid-Europe you cannot imagine that people have such a natural friendlyness and such a quality of service in their heart, always with a smile on the lips - this resort and its owners are just so natural hospitality people and do you want to know a secret? There`s everything above avaerage. A lot of people wrote already about the food but the food is even"
50,"Las Hadas has spotless, well-appointed rooms in beautiful grounds at a very reasonable price.  My wife and I stayed four nights, and would have stayed more had we been able.  It has a great swimming pool, and a beautiful beach and lagoon across the highway, with lots of birds and even sea turtles (protected by the local village).  Victoria and Milo took great care of us, and Victoria is an excellent cook -- fresh-caught fish fillets, quesadillas with squash blossoms -- you name it!  The resort is 20 minutes from Puerto Escondido, so it's very quiet and well-located for exploring this section of the Oaxacan coast.  San Pedro Tututepec, a Mixtec kingdom the Spaniards never conquered, is a half-hour drive, as is Pinotepa Nacional, the main  center of Afro-Oaxacan culture.  Amazing"
50,"After 3 nights at the Rinconada in uerto Escondido we decided to have the more laid back vacation - just ocean, pool and good food and at tripadvisor we read about Las Hadas. Well let me tell you a secret: The food is even better than they describe in the reviews. And once again it's an owner who offer this special gift - Victoria, owner and chef has the capacity to ""beam"" you into all gorgeous secrets of Mexican cusine. She'll finish you meal with the very special extra spice, extra care and extra taste and we seldom had visited any other place with such a tasteful cuisine. BRAVISSIMO! The units at Las Hadas are nice, spacious and very clean. There's a/c and a separate living room. It seemed to us as if Las Hadas Has the nicest and biggest pool in the PE area and the grounds"
50,"We decided to have the maybe most important event of our entire life at Las Hadas Resort on the Pacific close to Puerto Escondido. We rented the whole place and the people at Las Hadas organised some more accommodation for guests who could not be accommodated at the resort. They also arranged for a shuttle service for the guests who had to stay outside. Our parents, best friends and brothers and sisters arrived already on Thursday - the rest of the ´gang´ on Friday. Thursday night we had a 7-course-dinner prepared by Victoria, the owner, together with her lovely helpers from the near-by village - everybody worked just as if they were one family. We had fresh home-made picaditas, then a mixed Mexican starter plate with Guacamole, bean dip, salsa, fresh tortilla and chips, white"
50,"Las Hadas is a beautiful hotel/club near the Pacific ocean and very close to Puerto Escondido - surfing paradies for young people from all ov er the world.   It was a very special experience. As we are from France the meals are very important to us and we decided for Las Hadas because of so many reports in tripadvisor. We must tell you that maybe it is the best food we ever had in any holidays. The meals are so healthy and you can smell, taste and see how the chef de cuisine, Victoria, feels pleasure to cook good food. This place is created with passion and anthousiasme and all staff work the sa,e way and they have the sweetest smiles on their lips. Wonderful service and very nice rooms with sleeping room, living room and air condition and a very nicely maintained grounds and"
50,"I was at Las Hadas as a single traveler and it was worth every cent I spent for this marvellous place - they did a very special price so that I could easy afford the hotel. I cannot write too much in English but I must tell that I was very amazed about the menus and Mexican cuisine, about the smile in the faces of the people and wonderful treatment, very good hotel rooms with air condition, living room, TV and even a small bar. There are many birds in this place and they have some ""country faisins"" that sometimes follow you step by step - very funny!  If you want to relax during your holidays and feel very special then I recomment the Las Hadas hotel - I'll be back with some friends next year."
50,"Just got back from an unforgettable experience near Puerto Escondido - Las Hadas resort and club - a hotel with such beautiful settings - I feel that the people who created this place were enlightened and inspired by just one thought: Create beauty and create a home for the 'fairies' (las Hadas means 'the fairies'). This place was like a fairytale and I still cannot believe that everything there match to one single high level: Apartments, nature, pool, food, staff, owners, management and energy - if you could imagine the feelings that turn around my head after this experience you would understand! Prices are a little bit higher than in the area but it is worth to pay a little bit more as it might be the most beautiful place in the area. If you consider to stay there you MUST try"
50,"My husband and I stayed at las hadas for a week this past march. We were very pleased with our stay. The grounds of the hotel are very well maintained and are without a doubt the most beautifully landscaped place in the region.  Since we were there in the dry season almost all the vegetation around and in Puerto Escondido were brown, but las hadas was full of green lush vegetation.  We stayed in a one bedroom villa that was very clean and comfortable.  AC and cable TV was available.  We spent a few of our afternoons on the beach out in front of the resort.  The waves were too big for us to swim there, but we just hoped in the pool when we got back to cool off.  The food at the restaurant was delicious.  You can tell much care is taken into preparing each meal.  Las Hadas seems"
50,"We stayed one week at this beautiful little hotel. Our room was comfortable and very clean. Our host Fatima, who speaks perfect English, helped us with everything we needed. Very warm and welcoming and child friendly. We also liked the location because it is within walking distance of several beaches and restaurants and also close to public transport while being a bit set back from the busy streets. "
20,We really like Hotel Careyes but the Internet was completely unusable for many days.  Ping test attached.  We were forced to pay for Telcel mobile data or work elsewhere which was inconvenient.. Even though we had receipts for the Telcel charges the hotel was unwillingly to take off the costs we incurred out of pocket. It turned what would have been a good review and experience into a negative review and experience. I won't stay here again.
40,"The parties may go on around you but they are local and usually quiet down by 9ish. The hotel itself is quiet.  The staff at Hotel Careyes are exceptional. Helpful and always smiling. English is spoken there. The hotel is kept very clean by the staff. The towels are always clean but some are in bad repair or small. They do have some towels for the pool area is you ask. There are two little patios. One on the  2nd floor and one on the 1st floor. Very nice for having a cup of coffee and catching up with friends.  The pool is quite small but serves well as a cooling off spot on those hot days. No fear, the beaches are about a 12 to 25 minute walk. Choices are endless. We liked it because the taxis are always passing by the entrance. And we were only a 4 minute walk to Chedhaul, the"
50,We traveled by bus from Huatulco to Puerto Escondido and were only blocks from this little jewel of a hotel!   The staff is very attentive and accommodating.   Quiet and secure.   We were able to walk to the main beach with shops and restaurants along the way.  We also walked to Playa Angelito and had the most delicious and fresh oysters!  Very good value and we will return again soon!
40,"We had to stay here by accident, because the hotel we paid for 4 Days was not available when we arrived in Puerto Escondido, nightmare....  so , we ended up at Careyes, in a nice 2 beds room, little varanda, good bathroom. The staff is extremely nice, helpful and accommodating. The rooms are very clean and have a good size. Our room was at the back of the hotel and very quiet. Close to the city market, 10 minutes walk to a major strip with restaurants and mini market. We recommend this place!"
40,"For a budget motel, it was clean and  of good value.   The hot water works well  and so did the airconditioner. It was a comfortable 3 night stay.  Security wise it was good also.  I came back from dinner on my last night at 22:30 and the front wrought iron doors were locked but, the night  receptionist opened it when I called out.    The wifi worked well on the 2nd floor where I lodged.   2 ladies run the coffee shop and they serve cheap breakfasts of simple fare.  There is also a small dip pool."
50,"This wonderful little hotel was a real find. My wife, my son and I stayed there for 4 nights in late August/early September and found it perfect. We had a good size family room at the front with 2 double beds and 1 single, with a balcony overlooking a fairly quiet street with pleasant square opposite,  an adequately sized bathroom, cable TV and super wifi. The cleaning staff are excellent and keep everywhere super clean and well-stocked. Bedding and towels are excellent quality. The owner and staff are really really friendly and helpful, always ready to help with arranging taxis for excursions to local attractions. The hotel is a good 15-20 walk from the centre of town and the main beach, but the two excellent and quieter beaches of Playa Manzanilla and Puerto Angelito are only"
50,"Excellent  super clean,no- frills hotel. 5 minutes from bus stop and up town. Beautiful beaches 10-15 minutes walk. We stayed 10 days and enjoyed our stay immensely. Owner and staff are exceptional and very courteous and friendly. We enjoyed our room with a balcony overlooking the street. Bedding and towels good quality. Looking forward to going back in 2017."
40,"This lovely little hotel is well located, just a few minutes from the bus depot and a short walk to Carazillio Beach. There is a small restaurant (untried by us) serving lunch and various coffees. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Great value."
40,"This small, no-frills hotel is well-located - just about a 10 minute walk to Manzanillo, Puerto Angelito, and Carizalillo beaches and the Rinconada area, which has yummy food. The staff here is very kind. The only downside was that the bathroom seemed to have a sewage problem, so it would get a little stinky at times, so we just left the door closed. If you're not looking for anything fancy and just want to stay in a clean, comfortable hotel that offers good value, then this is the place. Oh, and they have wifi, which is a big plus!"
10,"Everything was bad. Over priced. Very bad internet, tiny bad bed. I didn't had the room I paid for. Paid more by hotels.com than their regular price. Bad and unsafe doors and windows, like living directly on the street. Could not sleep until 2:30 in the morning, HYPER NOISY party just in front. On all the photos you see, just one representing the real <regular> room I had. I suspect many fake review. Nothing related to 8/10 score. So many other hotels in the area, almost impossible you will find worst. I suspect Hoteles.com to remove bad review. Last experience for me with them."
50,"I stayed there for a couple of night and the location was simply great. It's a walking distance from the beach. It's locate on El Adoquin which is a small street with everything you need (drugstores, convenience stores, cafes, restaurants, bars and a nightly market). I took a few of the tours they offer on the same street and the experience was worth every penny. For a solo getaway or an adventure long weekend with friends Puerto Escondido and this hotel/hostel won't let you down."
50,"Hello my name is Honey.  I stayed one night in the dormitory suite of Casablanca Hotel.   The linens are so fine and fresh towels as often as need be.  Bunks made daily and mysteriously with military precision. The hotel itself is situated in the heart of the city on a curvy cobblestone street that embraces the natural flow of the ocean's edge.  All the amenities are here.  At night the music is lively, continuous and soft.  Pure lavender oil is all you need in the evening to repel the mosquitos who might be willing to feast upon you.   The back grounds are cosy and private.  They feature a huge rainfall shower followed by a modest pool that brims with translucent water even softer than glycerine."
40,This hotel/hostel is right on the Main Street near the beach. We stayed in a small I bedroom room right above the street. Bed was a double and was clean and comfortable.the room is very small but it had what we needed. Fridge for snacks and beer. Hotel has wifi and a pool that is kept up nicely. No restaurant on site but two right across the street. Markets line the street and at night they close the road to vehicles and all the merchants pull their goods from indoors to out in the street. The streets fill with shoppers and the three discos come alive. Usually goes till very late so bring earplugs if you need sleep. Was a great experience and people are friendly. Water taxis or land taxis will take you to any of the beautiful beaches or walk across the street and go to the main
40,Location of this hostel was very good close to the beach. Don't stay here if you don't like music in the evening/ night because it is in the middle of everything. A-C in the room was nessecarry in the heat
50,"This was our meeting place while we were in Puerto Escondido. Such great, healthy food - nowhere comparable in town. Tasty, organic coffee and baked goods made with love and served by a very friendly staff. Nightly workshops on a number of topics were interesting. Thanks so much, guys! We will be back!"
30,"To be honest I only stayed here because this was the only place that took credit card. I got a pretty spacious room with two beds all to myself for 500Mexican pesos, but there was no AC!! So that would be my negative comment. The pool was ok the faciliites were clean. So I did not mind, just a regular hotel, nothing special about it. But I do recommend it."
40,"I stayed here quite a while ago. All I remember is it was clean, comfortable and the staff was very friendly. It is a very typical Mexican style hotel. Tile floors that keep it cool and clean.  It was in a great location too! "
30,This hotel is well priced with large rooms and great balconies over looking the street. The rooms are clean and staff are very helpful. The only complaint I have is that on Friday and Saturday nights it is very noisy as music from near by bars will keep you awake.  There is also a very good restaurant attached to the hotel. I would give the hotel four stars but the nose can be extreme on the week end.
40,"I stayed in One Love for four nights and loved my stay. I booked a double bungalow with a porch/hammock which was even better than in pics. The bungalow and the outdoor space were secure and felt private. The staff were incredible and always there to help and the location was perfect, walking distance from La Punta but on a quiet/secure street. The bungalow with spacious bathroom was also incredibly clean as staff cleaned rooms daily. The roof terrace was also a highlight as it allowed space to work with good wifi and shade/coolness from the heat (I visited in May which is one of the hottest months)."
30,On a recent vacation trip to Mexico my travel companion and I wanted to visit some of the beaches further south from Acapulco. There is literally no way to get to Puerto Escondido except on a bus and that takes hours of travel through the back country. Once you arrive Puerto Escondido is magical.  The Hotel Casa Blanca is right in the heart of everything. It is situated on the main street where there are lots of good restaurants and shops.  The hotel is basic. Services incude a small restaurant attached to the lobby. There is a pool on the main floor.  The rooms are ample. We rented a room with two large beds. The balcony overlooked the street. Two large french doors allow for some ventilation.  There is air conditioning but that comes at a considerable price. The overhead fan
50,"Very cosy place, super friendly employees and owners. It feels like they read every wish from your lips, it‘s very clean, they have tasty food for fair prices and a warm hearted atmosphere. Absolutly recommend this place!"
50,"Nico and his staff are very hospitable. They keep everything super clean, which doesn’t seem to be the norm in Puerto. The terrace is beautiful and they offer great yoga classes for about $5 USD. Short walk to la Punta and easy to grab the Colectivo to Zicatela. Highly recommend! "
50,"We stayed at the hostel for one week. Everything was great: the location is brilliant, less then 5 minutes from the beach, the hostel is stylish and clean. The service is excellent, very nice, giving you good and useful information about the place, great vibes in the place and chill atmosphere. Very recomend :)"
50,"Super nice place, very very clean and very nice staff. Highly recommended as we think it is the best place to stay in PE! Especially Ernest, who works at the hostel is an excellent host who pushes hospitality to new limits :)   The beach is really close and the staff will give you very good recommendations regarding sport, food and tours. Would book again :) "
50,"My stay at One Love was perfect for me, and close to the beach! I travelled solo and stayed here for 8 nights, you open the door and you are basically surrounded by palm trees and other plants. Niko welcomed me, explained everything, and immediately helped me to find the best surf instructor. Everyone is so welcome there and really make sure that guests have a good experience in Puerto Escondido. The food is extremely fresh and delicious, try the fish tacos, I was told three different times to try it...best tacos ever. The refreshing pool was perfect to cool down in the evening, and the hammocks on the terrace are so comfy I could sleep there for 3 hours."
50,Had the most amazing time at the one love hostel! Thanks to the whole team making our stay unforgettable!  The hostel itself is very clean and comfortable! Everyone made our trip unforgettable! It felt like home away from home! Thanks for all the help organizing all our trips and helping us seeing as much as possible from Puerto Escondido!  We had a couple of special request and the team was more than flexible making our special wishes come true!  Looking forward to coming back!  
50,"Beautiful grounds, clean rooms, and friendly staff. I enjoyed my visit, and Nico took good care of me when I needed assistance. When there was confusion in the booking of my room he upgraded me to a better suite, which was lovely. Check this place out when you come to PE"
50,"This hostel has been the most beautiful, cleanest and friendliest place I've been to. Lots of greenery, clean towels every second day, the staff is awesome, nice and helpful. I can't complain about anything. Loved the food and coffee in the morning, well located, it's a beautiful and really calm, happy place :) thank you so much for having me there! "
50,"Without a doubt one of he most amazing places i've stayed! Everything about it is perfect and i cannot recommend it enough.  I was very nervous about traveling alone for the first time, but Nico the owner made me feel very welcome and i ended up meeting some wonderful new people and spending the two weeks of my time there with all of them.  The Hostel is set in a beautiful location, with a little sitting pool where you can meet new people, it has the most incredible yoga for 1.5hrs every morning (its so cheap with great instructors), there is a restaurant/bar on site that serves great food and drinks and its only a few minutes walk away from the beach and local town. I was so sad to leave and can't wait to go back again next year!"
50,"Amazing! If you are debating about Losodeli and another place, stop debating, go to Losodeli.  I had been to Puerto before while working remotely and I stayed at an Airbnb. The place was nice, but the wifi was very unreliable there. I heard from someone else that Losodeli had the best wifi in Puerto, so I decided to move there. BEST decision ever. I had zero issues with the wifi, it is fast and reliable and I was able to work remotely there without any issues.  On top of that, the ambiance in Losodeli is great. Very nice, chill place. I meet really cool and open people there, everyone is very friendly and nice. Also, the staff is super attentive and care about you have a good experience.  Highly recommend!"
50,"I had initially booked 5 days in Losodeli. I stayed over two weeks, and only had to leave because I had to leave Puerto Escondido. There is something about this family that makes you feel at home instantly, surrounded by open-minded, adventurous and interesting people. The staff is super friendly, accommodating and they give great recommendations. I needed to work from my room and the coworking space, and never had any issue with Wifi (which is pretty rare in Puerto Escondido). If you're looking for a chill vibe, with people who also know when and how to have fun around the city, this is the place for you. I highly recommend Losodeli, and will be back."
40,"The facilities here are clean and well maintained , pool is clean and  good ,a couple of  beaches are all within walking distance, staff are friendly, I enjoyed my time here and it's  quite close to bus station "
50,"Had a wonderful 7-day stay at Casa Losodeli and I’m already missing it! The hostal is very cozy and familiar, the rooms are comfortable and the location is very central. My favorite part was relaxing by the pool or reading under the shade of the large mango tree after a day of being out and about. The hostel is only minutes away from the airport by taxi, walking distance from the restaurant-filled Rinconada and beautiful Carrizarillo beach, as well as it is only a short colectivo ride away from Zicatela or La Punta beach. Casa Losodeli also offers a café with hearty breakfasts (some of the bests in them, in my opinion), a shared kitchen for family dinners and a recently opened pizzeria. Thank you to “la familia” Losodeli for such a great stay!"
50,"They have a super good piscina area with a bar.  If one of you major concerns when traveling to Mexico is security, then you will like to know that this place does its part really well. The hotel is like a little fortress.   I have been here for a week and I always look really well for cheap and good places to eat and I think the cafe here has been the best. Food is high quality but the price you pay is the same you pay for low quality food.  The have some bikes to borrow. Right now they allow guests to borrow it for free if you return in less than 2 hours (this is a great plus in my book)  I find the location great if you are the type that likes to explore all over the place. The reason is that the main road is in front of the hotel, there you can get dirty cheap public"
50,"This place is amazing! The room was very spacious, the food at the cafe was delicious, and there is also a happy hour every night at the bar. The whole place has great wifi and it is a great place to just relax and chill for a bit. The beaches are also within walking distance. Highly recommend you stay here."
20,Stayed here one night. Probably wouldn’t stay here again. No hot water to be had. It didn’t matter how long you let it run. I think they charge too much for what you get. Didn’t care for breakfast in their restaurant either.
50,"I spent 3 nights at Casa Losodeli and can't recommend this place enough! The location is very central and walking distance to beaches, restaurants and ATM machines nearby. I booked the fully equipped apartment which had cooking facilities, large open living area, ensuite, work desk, balcony and comfortable bed! There is happy hour at the bar every day, hammocks to chill in and a swimming pool to cool off."
50,We had a private double room here. The place is more like a hotel than a hostel. We liked it so much we returned for a second time!  -it was spotlessly clean  -the pool area was fantastic -always a supply of hot water with good pressure in the showers -AC was good and much needed during a Mexican summer all the staff were super friendly and helpful -good food available in the restaurant  - place has a really sociable vibe without being a party hostel   The only thing that would make this place better is having a few more sun loungers by the pool. There are only two at the moment and it’s too hot to lay down on the ground so if you want to tan it means sitting on a chair.  
50,"I was drawn to book Casona Sforza based on the beautiful architecture and after staying there, I can say it exceeded my expectations for service and food. Though the area is more remote, it's well worth the isolation to have a real oasis to relax and offer a unique experience. It feels like living in an architectural magazine, but with friendly and approachable staff. We only stayed 2 nights but maximized our time at the pool, beach, restaurant and took advantage of ordering in-suite massages. I love the community concept to support local artisans and businesses - from the beautiful glassware to delicious coffee and toiletry products, it really enhanced the experience of our stay.  We felt so well looked after and it was the perfect stay as a couple. I'd highly recommend if"
50,"We had some great days at Casa Losodeli. The whole place is beautiful, everything is super clean, the staff is very nice and kind and it's just the perfect place to relax and enjoy the sun. We loved it there! "
50,amazing. you must go! It was the best! I cant recommend it enough. The rooms to the staff. Everyone is so nice and makes sure you have everything you could ever need in a hotel. Love this place and cant wait to come back 
50,"Casona Sforza is an absolutely gorgeous property made even more special by the attentiveness of their staff.  Attention to detail throughout was exceptional from beyond luxurious bath products, candles and incense in the rooms, beds that offered the best night’s sleep I have ever experienced to the overall ambiance of the property.  Just go!!"
40,"We loved our time at Casona Sforza.  The entire property is stunning and the food and drinks are good.  The staff was also really kind and attentive.  It's a secluded property, so you cannot walk to any other restaurants and the road to the hotel is bumpy (not a problem if you just want to stay on property, as we did... the hotel will also call you a car if you want to go anywhere but it's a bit of a trek out).  This is a quiet hotel... even at capacity there aren't a lot of rooms, so it's a very chill vibe.  The rooms are lovely.  That said, I would not recommend the ""Hot Tub Suite"" as it is a natural bathtub with cool water, not a traditional hot tub on the patio.  The room is right above the bar, so the noise filtering up when the patio doors are open is significant.  Other"
50,"An incredible stay and a must visit for any trips to Puerto Escondido. Every detail of the hotel, from the  exquisite architecture and amenities, to the amazing staff made this a memorable experience. Miguel especially was brilliant. We will certainly come back!"
50,"We (2 people) stayed at Casona Sforza for 4 nights and we had such a lovely stay - this was my 2nd time in Puerto Escondido and I love that it is a beautiful, less touristy vacation spot. Casona Sforza creates a wonderfully memorable experience and treats their guest with the utmost warmth, respect, and care. The entire place is impeccably designed - beautiful and effortless at the same time. Our room was gorgeous with beautiful amenities (including A/C) and a very functional layout. All staff members are so friendly, helpful, and kind hearted. Food and drinks are delicious and made to order with care. Given there are a small number of rooms at the hotel, spaces never felt crowded. Also, it was very nice that it is adults only. Overall, we loved our stay and highly recommend"
50,"Besides stating the obvious (that archeologically the place is a work of art), the vibe of the hotel and the service from everyone from Bartenders (including stunning  Macarena) to hosts is just extraordinary. This place really is a gem."
50,"Spectacular design, food, and service. Loved the fact that it supports a local indigenous community. I also enjoyed how quiet it is (only 11 rooms). Perfect for a peaceful getaway. I went by myself but the place is so romantic, I want to return with my husband :)"
50,"Casona has exceeded our expectations ! This property is GORGEOUS. From the structure , to the decor ,the cleanliness ,  the relaxation , the friendly & fun staff, delicious food & even the hip music playlist from morning to night ! Every single detail was well executed . We felt pampered everyday . A much needed true disconnection from the rest of the world . We can’t wait to go back again !"
20,"El hotel tiene un diseño muy bonito, pero no es nada cómodo o funcional. Los aires acondicionados de los cuartos no alcanzan a enfriarlos porque las puertas del balcón no sellan correctamente. No hay cortinas para evitar que se meta el sol en la mañana por lo que no puedes descansar y levantarte tarde. Se escucha todo lo del cuarto de arriba o abajo, no hay privacidad. La alberca no tiene un cm de sombra, y no tienen sombrillas que ofrecer. La recepción cierra temprano y abre tarde, entonces si sales temprano el día del check out, debes hacer el check out un día antes, muy desorganizado todo. La comida y drinks excelentes y un precio muy razonable. Está muy bonito para una foto de instagram e irte a la fregada pero NO les recomiendo hospedarse aquí.  The hotel’s arquitecture and"
50,We get a membership to the beach club at Villasol each year for a number of years now. This year is much Improved in that the music is quite wonderful as it is not played at a “noisy” volume as in previous years and is a lovely choice of tunes. Unfortunately good friends of ours quit going to the Villasol this year because of the noise and they joined an adjacent beach club.  Also the Internet is superb this year and is in fact better than the hotel that we stay at on the Rinconada.
30,"Considering this is one of the pricer places to stay in PE, it was a disappointment. On the positives, the location is lovely, the beach club is clean and not over-crowded, the beach and pool are lovely & clean. The negatives are all to do with the service; the staff are very friendly and have great intentions but are very poorly trained in terms of efficiency. The hotel seems to be understaffed, on one evening there were approximately 30-40 customers in the restaurant with only 1 very hard-working waitress. We couldn't even find her when we wanted to pay. On 2 separate occasions the hotel phoned us very late at night to ask for payment details because they failed to set-up our room bill. Some of the staff argued with us regarding this even though they didn't communicate"
10,"Unfortunately, I must recommend that people do not stay at this resort due to management issues. We stayed 5 nights and rented out 3 rooms. The hotel has it's positive attributes, including kind waitstaff during the breakfast service and the women who cleaned the room and wished us a good morning. Though there were positives, we also experienced many negative parts of our stay as well. Our biggest issue pertained to how the management dealt with our problems. Our room, 531, was on the top floor of the hotel complex which we originally enjoyed because of the view. A few minutes after settling in our room, loud construction sounds including banging, hammering, and drilling, were giving us headaches. We arrived jetlagged from Europe and wanted to have a rest before heading to the"
50,"The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The pool is cool and refreshing with poolside food and drink service. The restaurant is clean , the service is commendable,  and the food is fresh and very tasty. The baked goods are freshly bakes each morning and delicious. "
30,"The hotel seems great, at first, but it is disappointing. Not much of the staff speak English. We stayed as a group and many of us had no hot water in our rooms. They were also working in that wing, so it was lucky I was there on Business. The banging and clattering started around 7am. No bottled water in the rooms. There is a jug of filtered water but was nervous of it. Food in the hotel average at best. Forced to walk to the restaurants up the road (about 15 mins) or take a taxi to town most of the time. They also seem to make up the room at some random time. Sometimes before lunch, sometimes afterwards. WiFi is a joke - hardly works and is slow. You also have to walk to the beach area (or take their bus) but it is about a 5 min walk."
30,"First of all, the pictures on the listing are outdated. The room we stayed in had a cracked sink and the outside window did no t loco. Overall, the room needs attention. The staff were not rude, but were not friendly either. We spent many hours by the pool and not once were we asked if we wanted to place an order for drinks or food."
30,"This lovely beach side area is part of a large resort . My comments refer to the beach area only. For a number of years my wife and I have joined and enjoyed this part of the Villasol complex. We do not stay at the Hotel but pay a monthly membership fee to use this facility which is on the beautiful Bacocho beach. My critical comments refer to the the poolside food and beverage service only. The food itself is quite good and always has been. However the service of such is often quite poor. Specifically the tabulation at the end of the day either in the enjoyable Pez Gallo restaurant or at the “quiosco” on the way out can sometimes be quite complicated as their accounting system is somewhat archaic and confusing. At the restaurant this year where we were a party of 6, we spent an"
50,"My stay at Hotel Suites Villasol was over a period of five weeks from January 20 to February 24.  This has been my third visit in a 5 year period.  I stayed last year for four weeks.  The hotel has seen many improvements and I rate it as excellent.  The management and staff do a wonderful job running this establishment.  The staff  at the front desk (Alicia, Carlos, Nestor), restaurants (Eric, Omar, Aristel, Shayla, Carolee, Diana, Olivia) Room cleaning, Beach club, Grounds (Jonathan), Shuttle Drivers (Moresto, Bento, Fermine), building maintenance (Victor, Alfredo) and many more unnamed were very warm and accommodating to this guest.  I would like to thank all the staff that permitted me to practice my Spanish on them and were so polite even when I'm sure it made no sense at"
50,"Hotel Suites Villasol in Puerto Escondido is an excellent and quiet hotel. Our room was clean, the staff were friendly and even if the hotel is not located down town it is pleasant and everything is within reach.One of the best parts of this hotel is their beach club ! Only 2 min away with a free shuttle bus. It's located at the beach and it's beautiful ! during some months of the year there is cinema at the beach with good international movies."
10,"Yesterday we were out all day (from  7:30am-4:30pm) and upon our arrival we noted that the room had not been made up. We called to see if they were going to clean the room and they told us that it hadn’t been cleaned because we hadn’t hung the “clean room” sign on our doorknob. Today we also left all day (this time we made sure to hang the sign on our door) and again we arrived to an unmade room. I called the front desk and in stead of a kind “don’t worry we will see what happened and fix this right away,” I was answered by a “did you hang the sign on your door?” “YES!” “Well our cleaning service ends at 5pm” “ok, it’s 4:56 so at what time were you planning on coming?”   Also, we found a purple cleaning rag in the room today that was not here this morning, indicating that"
10,"Great location, nice pool good sized room but Horribly dirty tiled floors clearly never mopped, hopeless cleaning staff, rooms that with a little money could be lively etc  This is a perfectly positioned hotel.that could be wonderful but due to lazy management and cheap owners is trading dishonesty.. its such a shame as well motivated staff and some money spent would transform this place. I have  looked at 5 years of complaints for the same thing. All unanswered and ignored"
20,"Stayed there during our stay in Puerto Escondito and were looking for  ahotel on the beach strip. The hotel is centrally located on the beach, just the road separating it from the beach (were you cannot swim since the waves are HUGE). Location is a plus, but keep in mind that there is a disco club just across the road making it impossible to sleep on the weekends (and i am usually a very hard sleeper...). The hotel itself is quite worn out, everything would need a complete makeover. And on the rooftop n there is a gym that plays music that loud, there is no rest during the day. Pool area is fairly clean but very small, not everyone will get a sunbed or shade. Breakfast is not served but only in a closeby restaurant on the road where service is on the slow side of things...."
40,"Very cool entrance, clean and friendly. Desk reception spoke only Spanish however there was one person who spoke very good English so we had help there. Our room is clean and updated and the sunset view is amazing!  Now the challenges. The sink didn't drain properly, no face cloths and very dim lighting in the bathroom. There was a utility noise that went off every 20 seconds, I counted as it woke me up several times throughout the night despite wearing ear plugs. There is also a beach club that played loud music until early morning. Had we known about that we wouldn't have stayed here.  Other than these issues, it's a decent place. "
50,"Sit at breakfast and watch the surfers on Zicatela. Spend the evening after a day at the sea and relax in the lovely, spacious pool. There are abundant chairs with umbrellas to protect from the sun. Food and beverage totally acceptable."
50,"My husband and I are from Portland Oregon and planned an EPIC trip to Mexico from mid January to mid february. We started in Puerta Vallarta and made our way down to Puerto Escondido, a groovy little surf town. Looking online we found this cute little inexpensive hotel and booked it for the last leg of our journey. We Scored with this place, right across the road from the beach, great cantina and restaurants, the have a nice swimming pool, laundry service and their own little bar/restaurant. I would stay here again"
50,"Hotel is very clean & conveniently located to restaurants & beach bars. It is right across the street from the beach with direct access. Elevator, pool, 2nd floor area to watch the sun set, watch the waves & surfers. They even had parking. There is an onsite restaurant/bar as well."
20,"The hotel is old and it can be noticed on several things. As an example the sink in the room was leaking and was not clean, the AC unit was porly installed. The rooms were not clean and the tip envelope to the cleaner was old with coffe stains on it. The bathroom/shower in our room was quite nevly renovated.  The wifi is not working in the rooms so you have to go to the lobby/bar to have connection. One of 30 workers at the hotel that we met spoke english.   The location is good and lots of good restaurants in the area, also the beach is just infront of the hotel.  The breakfast was not soo good, nothing extra. You can get better breakfast at other places.   "
20,"After browsing hotels in the area for staying a few nights after getting married (not honeymoon, just to spend a few days at the beach with family) we decided for Olas Altas because of their location, almost on the beach.   The hotel is somewhat nice, from the street it appears really nice but as you get in it's kinda worn down, and needs much more maintenance than it's getting.  Room was fairly nice, but dirty. Had used toothbrush in the toilet, had a nightstand that fell off the wall as I put my phone on it, cleaning staff that didn't do much cleaning or even change the towels.   We were a group paying for 5 rooms, all payed the same rate and some had breakfast included, some didn't, which was really strange, even after getting confirmation over phone before making"
30,"Famous for the bih surfing waves, hotel in perfect location across the beach.  Nice restaurant in front fscine the beach.  Nice beach bar across the street.  Big pool and patio to enjoy.  Room nice and clean."
50,We stayed there for a week with a group traveling on a medical mission trip to the towns more inland. The staff and management were very accommodating. When some of our group caught some large fish their kitchen staff prepared them for the group and it was delicious. Their meeting room was comfortable.
40,The staff was very friendly and the maids did an excellent job cleaning the room each day! This hotel is also very affordable. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay right on the beach.
50,"Our dab driver thought we should stay at the Santa Fe, since we came on our own plane. But we love this place. Right on the El Adoquin, the small zocalo on the playa principal. All the fishing boats and souvenir shops are right there.  Be careful of your room. To the south is a disco, which is very noisy.  Cannot beat the price. People very nice. "
40,Unbeatable price. Very nice people. But it cold have AC because the tempreature is very hot all the time
50,"Cable tv, aircon, and right on beach at low season price of mxn 500 prpn is unbeatable."
40,"I stayed for two weeks at this hotel in a double room, having breakfast and lunch at the open air restaurant upstairs. My room was cleaned every day, I enjoyed the friendly atmosphere in the garden, appreciated the helpful and serviceminded staff, enjoyed the good food of the restaurant with a view to nearby Ziccatela beach. The hotel is right by the beach wellknown for surfing. I spent Eastern hollidays here, and Puerto Escondido changed from being a quite and preaceful town, to becoming a crowded partyplace. Loud music from bars till early morninghours disturbed some nights sleep, but soon after hollidays ended, there where peace and quite again. Maybe avoid peak season, if you like the more ""tranquil"" experience of charming Puerto Escondido. Altogether I will warmly recommend"
30,"Everyone was really sweet.  The grounds are beautiful, food very good, views from restaurant superb, coffee delicious.  But if you want to sleep....3 or 4 nights the loudest disco ever plays just across the road on the beach. till 3 am not fun for us..we finally got moved away from the street but still had to wear earplugs.   Price for our room was fair."
30,"We tried several hotels in PE and this was our last. Central location, beautiful garden, nice big pool, ok rooms, so so restaurant. Most of the hotels in PE seem to be stuck in the seventies. They are basic accommodation at reasonable rates. The biggest turn off, totally nothing to do with the hotel, was the fact that we didn't get any sleep for 2nights due to the fact that there was a Reggae concert untill 6am. The base being so strong that it rattled the windows continuously. All the hotels along the beach were affected by this."
50,The last time I was in Puerto Escondido I stayed at the Arco Aires the pool was not even finished yet but everyone that work there was great when I come back I will be staying at the Arco Aires for sure
30,"Puerto Escondido has blossomed in recent years and there are many new hotels at every price range.  Hotel Arcoiris is an older hotel with parking, pool, restaurant, wi-fi,and landscaped grounds.  It is across from the longest beach (Zicatela) which has many beachfront restaurants.  However, there is almost always a dangerous undertow at Zicatela.  We went to the beach nearer to town (to the right as you exit the hotel) where you can see the fishing boats  but not near to them -- good bodysurfing.  We had drinks at the upstairs restaurant/bar at sunset and the drinks were good and there was live music some nights.  Our room was very large with an overhead fan which was like a jet but we were on the ground floor and I got warm at night even with the fan.  There are rooms with air"
50,"Have returned her for Xmas many times over the last 20 years, on my own and also with my son from him being 5 years until now 12 years. All Staff especially Juliette and Jupiter are fantastic, helpful and welcoming. Rooms functional, roomy and clean. most with own balconies looking over the beach and the sunset. Perfectly placed, reasonable price. Great place to chill out, pool area good place to hang out, restaurant facilities perfect. Very child friendly, but not over run by them. Only down side is that over recent years it has got a bit noisy on the street in front of the hotel late at night from partying. A few bars nearby think they are in Ibiza, but doubt they will be around for long spoiling the chilled out atmostpher of the place, and to be fair I am normally there at"
40,"I really loved this hotel and found its grounds and quiet environment wonderful.  It seems a tiny bit dated with the light fixtures and such, but it appealed to me completely and feels very much like ""old Mexico"" with the ferns and stone steps and painted tiles, etc.  My room was reasonable, cheaper than many of the surrounding hotels considering the amenities (restaurant, pool, tourist shop, ATM, massage, and more) although I will agree with one reviewer who had troubles with the internet.  I also could not get internet in my room and was obligated to sit outside and getting bitten up by mosquitoes as that is the only place I could get a good connection.  So I was disappointed with this aspect, but otherwise I found this hotel very sweet.  Staff were super nice, the room was"
50,"I spent at hotel Arcoiris for 3 months while I where doing my studies there( sep-nov2010). everything was great! the staff where excellent, everything I needed help for they would come and help. the food was good, the rooms where clean and had good space, and they had internet.  the location is wery good, it is right next to the beach, not far from shops, restaurants, bars and cinema, and if you would like to walk to the city it only take about 10-15min, and a taxi is always nearby. the people , life and culture at zicatela beach is perfect! I  promise if you go here you will not regret!"
10,"I booked a room by phone and they quoted me a price of 500 pesos per night including breakfast but when I checked in I was told that breakfast was an extra 100 pesos! Real good for a start! Then it got worse very quickly! My room was ocean-view but right on the road and out of the six nights I stayed there I couldn't sleep three! Very loud students residing at the hotel went out all night every night and looked so bad in the morning at breakfast you didn't have to run a breathalyzer test on them!  My room was very hot and because of the noise it was not possible to keep the window opened. The staff seemed totally unconcerned, very unprofessional, smiled a lot but nothing ever happened... The management was nonexistent if they have ever heard of hotel management! A very bad"
50,"Arco has many things to recommend it- friendly,  helpful staff eager to please. Rooms are large and all but two (213,214) have excellent large balconies overlooking the ocean.Furniture is eclectic but all rooms have at least two beds, a desk some with fridges etc. An excellent mix of Mexican and various nationalities tourists staying for long periods all through Dec, Jan, Feb and March. Easy to meet and make new friends.Restaurant is relaxed , accommodating and friendly. Servings are large and beans ,salsa and totopas are brought to the table while you wait for your order. All rooms are cleaned daily regardless of length of stay. Hard to beat. Babylon(meeting place) can be noisy at times and probably the biggest problem. We love the place and call it our second home."
10,"I called a business friend to meet her at the hotel Aldea Bazar reception, in Puerto Escondido.  I was there with my two minor girls. My friend arrived and I took her to a table wick a few feet from the reception desk. The manager who refused to give me her name, out of the blue, stopped and yelled at my friend telling her that she had to pay $200 to seat at that table. She told her that she was very old and dirty and that she was calling the police on her if my friend did not remove herself from the premises. I was shocked. My two little girls started to cry because the manager was yelling like nuts. I gently asked my friend to leave and the manager refused to apologize or talk about it."
40,"This is a lovely, simple, yet tasteful accommodation.  The yard and pool is quiet, clean, and inviting with a beautiful view of the ocean.  The hotel employees were hospitable and responsive to any inquiry we had.    The hotel is located close to some amazing beaches and to a community that offers several options for great food."
50,"Aldea del Bazar is a non expensive, quiet hotel in Puerto Escondid, located in the Bacocho area and near the Bacocho beach. The rooms are comfortable, spacious and clean. The pool area has a beautiful view of the ocean and a perfect spot to watch the susents during Winter. The pool is of a nice size, enough to do some laps if wanted,and sorrounded by an always well kept garden. The only aspect I would say needs to be improved is the restaurant & bar service at the pool area."
30,"Tripadvisor booted an earlier review so here goes again. We stayed at this hotel about 5 years ago. There used to be an agreement with the resort below this hotel with beach frontage - hotel users could use the beach and dine in the restaurant.. No more unless you pay a cover charge - even to eat in the restaurant.  The hallways of the hotel are very dark and it's hard to get the key in the door lock. A waiter at the hotel restaurant appeared to try to shortchange us when he brought back our change which was 100 pesos short. He did give us the missing 100 pesos after I spoke up. We've toured Mexico six years on a motorcycle and never had anything on the bike touched - until we parked it at this hotel. Someone opened a canvas like bag, went through it and left it open during the"
50,"this is hotel, though a bit dated, offers large comfortable rooms and a huge pool with ample seating space under shade. definitely a great find for the cost. it is in a quiet setting but not far from restaurants and swimming beaches,. Extremely helpful staff: thank you Moises Romero and Reynalda!"
40,"Have been to Puerto Escondido many times. Thought we would stay a little further out this time. Glad we did. The hotel rooms are large and clean, comfortable beds. The property is big, lots of open areas to relax and take in the sunsets.  Bar - Rest area is nice and open. Big pool which you need for those hot days. Walking into town is a half hour or a cheap quick taxi ride. The ""Arabic"" architecture ?? Some reviews said it is so Mexican/Spanish ??? Maybe if you are in southern Spain or Morocco. Interesting architecture for down south in Oaxaca. Only draw back was the price of beer at the bar...50 peso's !!! in a foam cup.... way to expensive."
40,Arabian style designd hotel. Quite and kindly staff. Even though little distance from beach but if you want to stayed quite and rest i want to recommend this hotel. Spa & masage. Masage is 500 mx peso ($25 somthing)
40,"I had been to this property 25 yrs ago and was very impressed.   Our recent visit was pleasant.  The grounds are very lovely but the property is older.   If you are looking for a quiet and relaxing property, this is a good one.    There is a beach club Coco's close by and it is very nice and has a lovely ocean view.   However, this property is located on the outskirts of town.    Zicotela Beach is at the opposite side of town.   It's where the major surfing competitions are held in May and November, night life and entertainment."
40,"I have so many things to say about this place, I'll start with the positive. Is absolutely beautiful. We got our wed pic taken there and even the photographer loved the view of the hotel. But, it has no amenities, they charge you for ice. 25 pesos a pitcher. The bag with 20 kilos of ice from store is 15 pesos. If you want to take drinks to pool you cant. They charge you for opening a bottle of beer, wine, or any kind of drink. If you are ok with no fridge, ice machine, coffee maker, and you dont mind having an extra bed in your room, this is your place. And I will say this, this hotel is designed to experience the Puerto Escondido living, surrounded by beauty and quietness. My husband and I loved it, we will definitely be back, even thoug there is no special note, wine, or"
40,"The hotel is in a nice residencial area of Puerto Escondido. You can enjoy beautiful sunsets from your room (if west oriented) and from the garden and the pool. The rooms are quite spacious and the white color dominates on everything. Two comfortable double beds sit in each room. The pool is very large and nice. Everything is shining clean but a little more maintenance would surely offer more crystal clear waters. Just one step more... Service is good and everybody are very kind. Very nice restaurant. The price paid was absolutely acceptable. No stores in the premises, but taxis cost really cheap, something like 2 dollars per trip. The beach is at walking distance at the bottom of the slope. Of course going down is easier than returning up. But it is absolutely worth. All the"
20,"There are so many positives about this hotel that we really wanted to love it. We had a gorgeous room, the beach is very close and there are great restaurants within walking distance. It also has a beautiful pool and the staff is amazing. But there is one very loud negative! A nightclub, that's a couple hundred yards down the beach, starts playing very loud thumping bass music about 9 every night that made our room vibrate. This was supposed to be a relaxing vacation but with no sleep - it wasn't."
20,"We have been staying at the Hotel  many times!  We always book the sea view or Ocean view rooms.  We know these rooms are on the street and can be loud! It is out of control!  We were there January 22,23, and the 24 th. On our last night the bar nightclub across the street Chula had entertainment. They started playing loud and I mean real loud wall shaking music at 9:00 pm.  The played all night long until exactly 7:30 in the morning.  No sleep at all!  They are not the only bar that does this.  Do not rent the Ocean rooms, in fact I would stay away from this place. It is a loud location, like you have ever heard before!.  This is no joke, and can make the trip to Zicatela miserable. The bars and clubs rule the area and do not care about the hotels. Go somewhere else! We were"
30,"This place had so much potential at first sight! The staff looked very professional and the pool area was beautiful. We really felt we got into a great hotel for about 10 minutes  Our room was right on the pool which could be a great thing if they had better audience coming to the hotel. The crowd was 99% Mexican and it seems like they are allowed to do whatever they want like putting mega speakers with loud music, hanging out smoking and having their screaming children out until 23:00 Needless to say we asked to change rooms and it didn’t happen..! Not amazing experience"
10,"Sadly the main reason for bothering with this charatureless hotel was the fantastic gym which is now more bedrooms. Shame as there is no other gym near to zicatela, which is so seriously needed for the semi/professional surfers staying in the dozens of other local rooms run by wonderful local families that need the money more than the Rockaway. The old Rockaway was a legend. New one just aimed at up their own backside Americans/rich Mexico cityites who have tried to spoil this chilled out diamond of a place and make it plastic and soleless. It won't work!!!!"
40,"Everything was great about hotel rockaway!  their breakfast is beyond expectations, it is delicious and complete. there are different options and tings to complement your breakfast! the room was small, but we had enough space and everything we needed during our stay. Staff always smiling and helpful, so we felt at home! the gym is pretty good, although it should be on ground floor. while doing some deadlifts some staff came to ask us not to make drop the weights because it upset the people in the main desk. Anyhow, the gym was pretty good!"
50,We stayed at the rockaway hotel for three nights. Its a great hotel. Very clean. Clean room and towels Every day. They have A-C which you need in Puerto. Poolarea and location are great. Its only ten meters from the beach. The staff is superfriendly and helpfull. Didnt hesitate to help me out with booking Some tickets (my spanish is not that good). Overall we had an awesome stay.
50,Highly recommend if you really want to lay back and relax. Right on beach with great pool restaurant on site inclouding a great room service.  The rooms were clean and they had very comfortable beds. Great fishing nearby or surf in world class waves.
50,"I stayed 4 nights with my girlfriend and couldn’t be happier. Awesome location across Zicatela beach and restaurants/bars area. Breakfast is included and super tasty. The staff is super friendly as they make great suggestions on what to do around. There is even a tours agency located there (Lalo Ecotours) which offers a lot of activities for affordable prices (Around 30 USD for all-day tours!!).   If you are looking to get know all the beaches around Puerto Escondido this is a great place as taxis will charge around $35-$45 pesos (Aprox $2 USD) to beaches such as Carrizalillo, Manzanillo, Punta Zicatela, etc.  This is probably the best hotel on Zicatela Beach so we are definitely coming back. Only flaw is the WiFi, its a bit irritating to have to be forced to log-in aprox every"
40,I can't say enough about the staff. Day before heading home I got a horrid ear infection. The staff got me into an ENT specialist. Hotel was very clean and quiet. Location was phenomenal! I will return. 
10,When we booked our one month stay in the 1-bedroom penthouse suite with infinity swimming pool we did not imagine these problems:   1. Noise - this suite is crazy noisy. It would only be fair to prospective customers to alert them to the outdoor disco next door and to indicate that the palapa roof permits ALL noise from the community into the suite. Even earplugs did not cancel the boom box base.  2. Air quality - the garbage burning from the adjacent property entering through the air conditioner in the bedroom is a serious health hazard. The plastic made it hard to breath and my eyes water.   3. Pool - it is a health hazard as the water does not circulate through a pump and nor is the water tested for chlorine levels. This is very troubling as the birds use the pool as a
30,"This hotel is regular... Regular rooms with regular bathrooms. Not the best and not the worse, I would say that it's a good standard for the price you´re paying. The pool and the garden around is beautiful and the location is perfect. A very good choice for the regular traveler that likes to live cheap, but not the cockroach and no doors kind of cheap."
30,"FOR THE PRICE: It seems like a great hotel and, above all, a great location.  However.. be aware, if you get ocean view, you get lots of noise from the street and bars.  I was resigned to deal with the noise from the street til 3am... it was the LOUD hammering in the hotel at 8AM on a Saturday morning that really bothered me.  Also, check the beds.. I was bitten all over my legs by fleas there. Not pleasant."
50,"I've stayed at Acuario numerous times and have never been disappointed. The front desk knows me by name and they treat my whole family as regulars, even though we only stay there once or twice a year. The pool is pretty shallow, but is perfect for when you're tired of being beat up by the waves or need some time out of the sun. The rooms can get pretty chilly with the air conditioning, but it's better to be cold than hot, in my opinion. We like to stay in the rooms that have a balcony that overlooks the beach. The hotel is in a perfect location -- right on zicatela, and surrounded by shops and restaurants. The hotel itself has a restaurant (it's a bit on the expensive side, but so worth it for some delicious food right on the beach.) The hotel also provides a discount at"
20,"Hola Fellow Travelers!  I read glowing reviews about the Acuario in Frommer's Guide and decided to stay there... However, we had problems from the start :) When trying to book by phone, my Mexican friend phoned first and was told that she couldn't make a reservation and that the price would be 700 pesos per night (?).  I phoned right back, asked to speak to someone in English and was quoted 600 pesos per night and was able to reserve a bungalow.    So, we arrive and find the bungalow  is a bit substandard... you will need the mosquito netting (supplied) as there are no screens on the louvered windows, etc.  The bathroom was dirty and in need of repairs the room was dingy and old but worst of all, the beds were rock hard (junk).  If you plan on drinking your holiday away then I"
40,"I've been in Puerto Escondido several times and even when there are better hotels than this, this is the one I prefer. Of course there are cheaper (lower) hotels too but at a the low rate of $ 25-40 USD depending on the room type, you cant complaint. The pool, the personnel is nice, you have a GYM, bigger rooms with kitchenette, minfridge in some rooms, all very simple, some rooms don't even have a wall so feels like you re sleeping on the open air, Beware of the mosquitoes (bed nets provided). And the perfect location, right in the middle of Zicatela beach, one of the hottest spots for surfers wolrdwide."
50,"What a great place. Min from everything and charming . This is my second visit and with all my researches of the area find it as a great value . Several different roons possibility .Most of the rooms have balcony with view . There is curent construction that will be done at the end of this month dec 2018, The all new section will offer a roof top bar and terrace with a greater view of the ocean and sunset. I could easyly live here year round,just love i t!!!"
40,"My husband and I stayed in one of the villas at Hotel Xaiba for 2 months, Jan - March 2016.  Some units have air conditioning, but we didn't need it.  The villa was clean and comfortable, with a small kitchen, couches, upstairs bedrooms with a small queen bed and 2nd bathroom. It also had 2 tvs, one on each floor. It worked for us.  However, the refrigerator was old and small; it froze food on the top shelf and barely chilled food on the lower shelf.  There is a 2-burner electric stovetop that was so small, 2 pots would not fit on it at the same time.  Plus the burners were very, very slow. Xaiba has a nice palapa and swimming pool.  Wifi was intermittent, and sometimes not there at all.  The lobby appeared to have the most consistent internet service. The hotel's age is showing"
30,"The hotel is well located if you want to visit Carrizalillo and Manzanillo Beaches. Hotel's sraff is kind and friendly. The rooms are nice and clean, but the price is quite high considering the room size and bed comfort. The swimming pool is too small. "
50,We stayed 3 weeks in February 2013. Loved the place. Staff very nice and helpful. Very clean and secure. Well situated to go to Carrizallilo or in town. All description on their site is true. You can walk everywhere.I will definitely return. Sorry a bit that this place is on Trip Advisor...it is a good secret to keep.
50,"We staid in a Puerto Escondido ""city""-hotel and even if it was very cheap we did not like it. We looked for a nicer place and found ""Las Hadas Villas"" or resort. Las Hadas is a little bit outside Puerto but  - what a place! First of all they surely have the best landscape in the whole area - a place maintained with love, love and love. Second they have a food to just desire more. How do they get that kind of taste into all of their food? and they have the most beautiful pool, most amzing beach in front of the property, nice 1-bedroom villas (even if we do not use a/c they have it! Very welcoming and friendly atmosphere and worth every minute there. Hopefully next time they'll clean the rooms earlier!?"
50,"My Wife and I had the Pleasure of staying at this Wonderful resort we originally booked 5 days but we enjoyed ourselves so much that we ended up staying on for 12 days. We found the hosts to be very friendly and the resort was immaculately kept, the room we were in was very clean and the bed was comfortable. We booked the all inclusive package which we found to be excellent value. The food was first rate and was a mix traditional Mexican fare as well as european specialties. The resort is  family owned and run which just added to the charm of this place, a  lovely family who made us feel very welcome. I can highly recommend Las Hadas Resort to anyone who wants to enjoy all that Puerto Escondido and surrounding area has to offer.   Phil Stumpf   Australia."
50,"We spent 9 days at Las Hadas last Christmas. It's a great plaace with greaat service, a family owned place with such a familar atmosphere - yoiu think you're part of this family. The food is really great and very health: You get lots Mexican food and some great salads and nice food from Europe too. Lots of games and the most beautiful beaches and lots of contacts with locals made our vacation so special"
50,"I have been to puerto escondidio for surf trips before and was taken to Las Hadas by a friend for a bite to eat.  The food was amazing, and after I ate I checked out the grounds and rooms and realized I wanted to bring my family here for a peacfull time away from the States.  We finally went this december and stayed for one week.  We all absolutely loved it and cant wait to go back again!!!  The owners made us feel right at home once we arrived.  We rented one of the rooms with 2 bed rooms, one bed for me and my wife and another for my son.  The room was clean and  fresh and very comfortable.  We had a sofa and cable TV, fans and AC.  We actually did not even use the AC at night, as the celling fans cooled us off just fine.  The food in the restaurante is outstanding!  I have"
50,"Been for vacation for a week in Oaxaca, Mexico around Thanksgiving and it was a blast. I discovered a secret new jewel right on the coast approximately 20 minutes from the airport of Puerto Escondido - it was a huge sign on the road that attracted my attention and especially the kid's! Las Hadas is new.It's called villas/club and it means ""the Fairies"". Las Hadas with 12 small villas,some of them with kitchenette and some with up to 5 beds in 2 sleeping rooms. There's a living room in the villa, a pivate bath room and there's air condition! They have a great smimming pool with a kid's pool, a thached cabana for relaxation with hammocks and sitting areas and some games for families.There's a restaurant and bar with thached roof too and the place is owned by a Mexican family."
40,Very well located. Stayed 3 weeks.Staff friendly and helpful.
50,I would not stay anywhere else on Puerto Escondido. The rooms are super clean. The restaurant is amazing. The staff is very friendly and they have yoga every day.  When you stay here the owner will take care of you personally!! Stay here next time you visit Puerto Escondido! 
50,"I booked few days and I regretted it, I should have stayed twice as much. I had the best room (if you can book the one love room). It's clean, friendly, beautiful and full of amazing people. I made friends like in matter of hours. Everybody is kind, the food is delicious, the yoga shala on the roof is just to day for. Very good lessons too.  It's walking distance to a very good surf spot but taxis are cheap and you can go everywhere in matter of minutes. Tip: go to the sitting pool in the late afternoon to socialize, all the guests and people working there are just delightful.. I will go back, definitely!"
50,"My sister and I stayed in a 4 bed dorm room. Beds were good and steady, bathroom clean and good looking. There's an outside kitchen. Small, but perfect because there're only 2 dorm rooms, and eating out is cheap anyway. Upstairs is a nice yoga terrace/rooftop. You can join the lessons (not for free). But when there is no yoga going on, you can relax in the hammocks. The restaurant is attached, also for non-one love hostal users. Good food. A small hot tub, which is actually a bit cold and really refreshing, is for hostal people only.  The staff is friendly, and if you're lucky and in for a party they'll take you to good party places in town. "
50,We stayed there for five nights and we enjoyed it a lot. The people are super friendly and helpful.  Ou room and the bathroom in it was very big and clean and with nice details.  If you are interested in Yoga.. there is the perfect place to do in the mornings.   
50,"I only have good things to say about this wonderful place.  Nico was so great to me from the beginning, arranging my stay and giving me advices about how to travel around...  The rooms are beautiful, calm, clean. You just feel like home!  And even if your trip is short, you just wish to extend it to be able to stay longer in this magical place.  The location, the food from the restaurant, the common area with hammock and the view, the jacuzzi, they thought of everything to make sure you won't wanna leave.   Thanks Nico and the staff, I will be back!  Valery from MTL."
50,"We had some complications with our travel and they worked with us like we were family. We were so happy we spent the little bit extra for the suite with a king bed and tub and outdoor living space. Delightful staff in the kitchen, front of house, security, housekeeping, owner, you name it. Coming from an executive chef (my partner), the food was phenomenal. A good mix of activities to do, location  tucked into a little oasis away from the hustle and bustle, but easy and cheap to get everywhere you need/want to go. We recommend this place and will go back without a doubt."
50,"One love Hostal is the greatest place I have ever stayed that isn’t my own home. in fact it felt like home. Me and my partner stayed here for two nights in the beginning of our trip to Puerto, we were welcomed with loving arms by the wonderful owner Nicko who had nothing but attentive love, attention and care for our needs and advice for the area. The hostel is so quiet and peaceful less than a minute walk from the beach but a perfect distance (15 min walk) from the exciting hustle and bustle of the other ends of the beach. You are cocooned in beautiful plants , offered yoga and an amazing roof top view 🌱 which is a nice break from the heat and the food is absolutely exceptional. Comfortable beds, clean bathrooms, fans In the rooms to keep you cool. We came back again three"
50,"We loved the place! My brother and i stayed at this amazing hostel. Everything was great since we got there, the staff was really helpful and welcoming, the rooms are super pretty and clean, is a block away from the beach and it offers daily yoga classes plus the food is outstanding! The owner is a really nice guy, he came to welcome us and you always see him going around the hostel getting along with all the guests. He’s an amazing host!  We had a great time here, we will definitely come back. "
30,"The hostel is awkwardly located inbetween the small surfing village Punta Zicatela and the bigger Puerto Escondido - there is really nowhere to go out to eat or drink in the little cluster of houses where it’s set. At night, you can take a taxi to Puerto Escondido (eg Playa Zicatela), but it’s not very convenient. Punta Zicatela in the other direction is quiet at night. During the day, you can walk to either beach for surfing or sunbathing, it takes about 15-20mins. The hostel itself is a nice place: if you come as a couple, you can get your own hut and get a lot of privacy. It’s not great for solo travellers - there aren’t any obvious common hanging-out areas that facilitate socialising. There is a restaurant/bar in the reception area, but it’s quite pricey and not very social."
50,"I was only planning on spending a couple nights in Puerto Escondido until I walked into this magical place and felt incredibly welcomed by the owner Nico and his friendly staff, so I ended up staying a whole week here. I've stayed in hundreds of hostels around the world but have never felt so safe, comfortable and at home as I did staying here. Nico is an amazing man that took the time to connect with all of his guests and make them feel welcome. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and clean. More quiet location close to the beach and cheap taxi ride away from the busy downtown area. Highly recommend staying here."
30,"We are two couples. When we arrived to check in about 5:00, we were told there was a problem with our reservation. They did not have the 2 rooms we reserved, but only 1 for the first night.  We doubled up and were moved the next day. Later the first night, I got a notification from Booking.com that the Hotel had earlier reported us a no show, leading me to believe that they had just given away our rooms when we did not check in earlier. The other big problem was the noise, there are bars with loud music all around the hotel. The rooms are very simple but comfortable enough, you have to ask for hair dryer and there were no toiletries provided. The pool is nice enough and the view and breakfast were wonderful "
50,"A lovely hotel situated across from the Mexican Pipeline.  The hotel has three pools, a large patio area and a restaurant.  The rooms are simple yet spacious and come equipped with air conditioning, two fans, a wardrobe, and a small fridge (optional I think).  The bathroom has a large vanity with a sink, and a shower (no tub). The location is very convenient to the beach across the street and to many fabulous beach-side restaurants.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room and grounds are very clean and tidy. The hotel restaurant is very good for breakfast, lunch or supper.  The restaurant staff were fabulous! The beach restaurant directly across the street is also owned by the hotel and is very good as well."
50,"Perfect location right across from the Mexican pipeline.The rooms were large and clean and comfortable.The wifi was strong, the shower had hot water and the air conditioner was very cold.The television worked fine.The staff were nice and accommodating.When entering the hotel you walk into a large courtyard and swimming pool, really cool set up.The breakfast was good eggs, juices, coffee, etc there is also a restaurant on site.They also have a cool look out on top of the hotel so you can view the waves and beach.The location was perfect if you like to walk and explore I walked multiple times from the hotel to Playa Carrizalillo and to Punta Zicatela.There are tons of restaurants on the beach to choose from.I would definitely stay here again."
40,"Nice place, not wow but good value. The stay includes a free breakfast which is delicious. Nice pools, very central location 100 ft. from the beach. Decent price. Simple rooms not fancy at all but nice. Large TV in the restaurant so you can enjoy soccer matches on Sundays."
50,"We have stayed here several times now.  This year for a whole 5 weeks or just under.  America and her family are amazing at taking care of your wishes and any concerns you may have, immediately.  The cleaning room staff are extremely efficient and always are smiling.  Just about all our meals ( specifically breakfast) have been here.  The food is amazing and the servers are the most friendliest people we have ever met.  Best of all, you can request a room that overlooks the ocean and breathtaking sunsets.  Let the romance begin.  There are 3 pools to choose from and an abundance of room and seating areas around the pools.  Guarantee you will love this hotel and restaurant "
50,"We stay here as a couple every time we come to Puerto. We love it because #1 - they accept pets and are very pet friendly! I can eat breakfast with my pup on my lap and can swim in the pool while my pup sits in the shade! What more can I ask for? A drink, you say? You can order fresh fruit smoothies all day long if you like and they have a great menu, large portion sizes and good prices!   It is always very clean and the rooms are comfortable with great beds and we have always had hot water, great AC and good internet. Many hotels along the coast say they have hot water and internet, but once you get to your room-it is not the case. Bungalows Zicatela has met our expectations every time. The staff is kind and always helpful! And every time we stay, the staff are working on"
50,"We stayed here for 7 nights and got a room with airconditioning and breakfast included. The airconditioning was such a lifesaver because it was incredibly hot and humid during our stay. The room itself was pretty basic just a bed and some tables which was fine because we didn't stay in our hotel rooms the whole time.  For what the room maybe lacked the breakfast and the service really made up for it. The breakfast was anything but average, they let you choose off of the menu at the restarant, everything we had was really good. Everyone that worked at the hotel is super friendly and it made for really enjoyable experience. The location of Bungalows Zicatela was perfect, its situated near the center of playa zicatela and just a short cab ride to anywhere we wanted to go. I highly"
50,"I stayed in this spot with a couple of friends and we had an amazing time, we met great people, and really enjoyed the location, since there were so many awesome places very close to us. We also met people there that hopefully turned out to be lifelong friendships."
50,Owner &/or Manager very friendly and stays of a month or longer are very reasonably priced.  Vetch nice pool and the rooms have A/C which you will appreciate.  Very nice restaurant is available with a good choice of food available from menu.  Literally steps from the ocean.  Plenty of other restaurants and shopping available all within walking distance.  And of course about 15 minute walk up the road is Brad's Bar called The Split Coconut.  Locals know this place very well.  Good eats and good friends.  A Caribbean Outdoor Cheers if you like.
40,My partner and I were pretty sick whilst in Puerto Escondido. The staff at Zicatela were so helpful especially Marco who made sure we were looked after every step of the way. He went above and beyond to help us out. Thanks again :)
40,"I stayed in this lovely hotel for several days at the end of May/start of June (humid/rainy season!). It is such a lovely place, clean and tidy with friendly staff and in a great location on the main street of Puerto. The rooms have television and a fridge - great for storing a few beers and the aftersun!  There is also a lovely swimming pool, and a smaller pool for toddlers or those who just want to sit in the water and relax.  The only negatives were the lack of air conditioning (although it was a particularly humid time of year so this would not always be a problem), and the noise from the street that continues until very late and starts up again nice and early.... so pack some ear plugs!"
30,"great place to stay!allsome prices!,the food is very good,some of the best i had in Mexico. Outstanding location.The beach is so close! right on the adoqin,very friendly staff,and very helpful.Best bang for your buck!If you want a kool place to stay the Casa Blanca is the place to be.O' yeh! the geckos not geiko are very friendly.goodday!"
40,"The hotel is in a perfect location at the heart of the Zicatela area, and directly across from  a dozen or so beautiful, tropical beach front bars. It is a 45 minute walk from the La Punta village hippy area, and about a half hour's walk from the Adoquine tourist strip, or a 35 peso cab from either, so close to other things of interest. If you book in advance you can get a better rate than they offer in the hotel. The air conditioner is a little tricky, make sure they explain it to you if you are having trouble (it isn't broken, the settings are just weird). Ours got so cold at night, it actually caused the window to break, as it is just so, so hot outside in Puerto Escondido. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the room cleanings are great and respectful of your stuff. The"
40,"This small hotel is just a half block off the main street along Playa Zicatella but those few steps make all the difference. This truly is an oasis with a beautiful garden and nice clean pool. The rooms are smallish but comfortable with great beds and they are kept very clean. There is a well equipped communal kitchen good for making breakfast if you are so inclined. You can get beer and juice from the fridge on the honour system. There is no air conditioning but the fans are good and the hotel does a good job at keeping the mosquitoes under control. The Wifi comes and goes (like most places in Puerto Escondido)  The live-in hosts are friendly and helpful and the layout of the hotel allows you to socialize or keep to yourself as you choose. If you like cats, they have three, one"
40,"We were looking for a night away and change of pace while visiting Puerto and this was a good choice for us.  Comfortable rooms, nice pool, and centrally located to walk to many places to shop, eat, and watch the sunset  "
10,"The normal rate is at least double of what it is posted. Rooms are pretty much according to their rating, tough the furniture, specially in the bathroom, is old. On top of this, service to guests is nothing but dreadful; it feels like a hotel abandoned by owners into a very inexperienced hands. Find other choices; will be easy."
10,"Just got back and this was amazing.  I just turned 50 and my friend wanted to treat me to a birthday present which was to go surfing at Puerto Escondido and stay at a nice hotel. Everything seemed fine at first  a couple of days we bumped into a friend.  The hotel abruptly told us he couldn't come up and visit, treating us like college kids.  They tried to charge my roommate for a guest to come up and visit.  Which hotel on the planet refuses to let you have a guest in the middle of the day? Nowhere but this place. My roommate had to battle out that one.  They harped on us daily about paying in advance WAY before checkout even though we signed up online. We walked down a flight of stairs to get coffee and check the waves and they are all over us like buzzards unable to speak"
40,"Staff was great.  Room nice with a wonderful A/C.  Bed was a tiny bit lumpy but comfortable overall.  There were 3 of us in a room and did not feel cramped.  Our balcony door didn't shut well or lock.  Notified the front desk and they sent someone to inspect it right away.  It was fixed in less than 20 minutes!  Really great service!  The pool is large and very nice.  We enjoyed swimming and just relaxing.  Maid service was great and didn't tardy in cleaning while we were at the beach in the mornings.   This hotel is just steps away from Zicatela Beach.  Very good location to shops, restaurants, etc..."
40,"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights after leaving the Hotel Aldea de Bazar. This place is in an excellent location, right in the middle of the Zicatela strip - you have easy access to all the bars, restaurants, taxis, a currency exchange and ATMs.   The rooms are average, so don't expect any luxury, but they're very tidy and clean, they have great A/C and I believe they each have two beds and a balcony as well. Apparently, the water from the sinks are also run through a filter, and the pool nearby is a nice touch.   There are a few quirks that prevent me from giving the place a 5-star rating. Luckily, I had a friend with me that was fluent in Spanish, but if you don't know any Spanish then you're going to have a lot of trouble communicating with the staff at this hotel - at"
40,"The staff is very helpful and welcoming. The rooms are clean, with balcony and air condition. The hotel has the perfect location on Playa Zicatela. Close to bars, restaurants and grocery stores. Zicatela is not the beach for swimming, but with a 5 minute taxi ride, you can find beaches perfect for snorkeling and swimming. "
30,"We have stayed here 2 times now. The first visit we left hotelito Swiss oasis as it was not what was advertized. The rooms here are clean, the beds however are so hard  It was like sleeping on a cement slab. Staff can be condescending at times. The restaurant is amazing. Food is good and fresh and the staff is great especially Liz who made friends with the kids."
30,"I have been to Olas Altas 4 times, the main reasons being the restaurant attached to it, its relative quiet despite the closeness to the main road, and the rather large swimming pool that I had more often to myself than one would expect. As others mentioned, the staff DOES NOT speak English, but is nice. Watch out for the very slippery tiles in the showers and bedrooms, I slipped one morning with my wet feet, crashed backwards onto my right foot and acquired a nasty total demolition of most bones in it. Years later I am still recovering and cannot wear regular shoes because of 3 screws permanently imbedded in that foot. There are NO DOCTORS in Zicatela, and the local pharmacist gave me Ben Gay (!) for my grotesquely swollen and black colored foot. I needed surgery in the USA."
50,The hotel is only few minutes away from the entrance to the best beach in the area - Carrizalillo beach. The pool is nice and there is a great view from the open air roof area. The rooms are large and clean with a full kitchen. The staff are wonderful! They are so friendly and helpful and made our stay awesome. 
50,We stayed 2 nights here. Its a very clean and neat hotel that has rooms that look like small appartments that you will find all what you need for a very convenient price! Great people and a plus... The swimmingpool! Definitely recommended! Great wifi and amazing view from the palapa on the top!
50,"What a pleasant surprise to discover the Quinta. Quite simply exactly what we were looking for in an authentic Oaxacan vacation. Location in the heart of the Rinconada district of Puerto it is perfect, close to all of the restaurants on Benito Juarez and close to all of the beaches. The hotel is only three years old and is kept in pristine condition. The rooms are all spacious, bright and airy. The grounds are well maintained with a very nice pool area and beautiful rooftop palapa. To watch the sunsets from the palapa was s one of the highlights of our stay.  Juan, the manager, is most accommodating and willing to do virtually anything to make your stay an enjoyable one. One of the added side benefits of the stay at the Quinta is the interesting other travelers you will meet"
40,The Quinta is a nice relaxing hotel and in a very good location. Hotel staff and management are always trying to be helpful.
50,"My husband and I have been traveling to Puerto Escdondido for around 10  years and staying in various different apartments, hotels, houses, etc.  This year with found Quinta Carrizalillo.  I must say it has been one of the most comfortable places we have stayed.  There are a total of 11 rooms, a nice covered outdoor swimming pool, very quiet atmosphere, wifi in the room, AC unit, and cable television.  Super nice for short or long stays, but especially for long stays.  High recommend."
40,"Clean, safe, big rooms, fairly new, nice swimming pool, air conditioned, very close to best beach in area (Carrizalillo), but no restaurant, no bar, and fairly clueless about what American guests want.  This hotel is used mostly by Mexican families.  Our room had not been used for a while, and while it was clean, there were not enough towels, no soap, no drinking water, and the wifi did not work for days.  Often, there is no staff on site, but they are nice and try to be helpful."
50,"This hotel and its staff leave a lasting image in our minds of a secure and pleasant one month stay in November 2009.  Our room was large, airy and bright and had a large, tiled bathroom with huge shower.   We loved the rooftop mirador for enjoying our morning coffee or to watch the breathtaking sunsets.   The small pool provided a welcome cooling off after an afternoon walk in the hot sun and the comfortable seating area was a great place to relax with a book.  The gardens in and around the hotel were immaculately kept and provided  a nice balance of greenery and colour to the grounds.  The hotel is only a few minutes walk to one of the best swimming beaches in the area.  Though this hotel is in a quieter area of Puerto Escondido, there was a small strip of shops, restaurants"
50,"wow nothing can describe how wonderful my stay at Quinta Carrizalillo was. It's location is perfect. It's so close to one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen, Playa Carrizalillo, and to many other great tourist attractions. The room we stayed in was so comfortable and lovely. We had air conditioner, cable tv, wireless internet, kitchen facilities, swimming pool...what else could you ask for? The staff was more than excellent! The manager, Juan Jose, was very welcoming and extremely helpful. I could not ask for a better place to stay in Puerto Escondido, & with such reasonable prices! This is a place I would definitely recommend to my family and friends back in California. If friendly and honest service and a welcoming staff appeals to you, Quinta Carrizalillo is the"
40,We stayed in Quinta Carrizalillo Hotel for 6 weeks. Location is very central to get everywere we wanted to go. Rooms are very spacious and clean. Deffenatly a place you want to go back to.We like to say THANKS to Juan Jose for making our stay very pleasent. Fay and Guenter Busch
40,"After spending 2 months traveling in Mexico (and staying at some very marginal places which cost much more than Quinta) it was a breath of fresh air for us to stumble on this place.  The pool is lovely, with high end patio furniture; the rooms and grounds are very clean; the rooftop palapa has one of the best ocean views in Puerto; the kitchen had all of the amenities we'd missed in other places - and Juan, the manager, is a pleasant and accomodating. Other friends joined us at Quinta after spending most of the winter traveling in Mexico and they appreciated the place every much as we did.  Both couples plan on booking again next winter."
20,We reserved a room with a king bed for 3 nights -- for a special birthday.  When we arrived we were given a room with 2 twin beds.  The manager kept telling me I was wrong about the reservation even though I showed it to her.    Internet was not working in the room and the manager kept shrugging her shoulders
30,"Stayed at this hotel whilst in Puerto Escondido - ate breakfast at the hotel which was quite tasty, and dinner once which was ok but nothing special. The service was slow but staff were friendly. The other slow thing in this hotel is wifi which at many times didn’t work. The bed was large with good AC in the room."
50,"I love this hotel.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  The food in the restaurant is very good.  With the way it is laid out among trees and flowering plants, it felt like an oasis.  Plus the beach is just across the road and the sunsets are gorgeous."
50,"Santa Fe hotel staff starting with admin. office, cleaning crew, restaurant crew,  are all wonderful, hardworking individuals that provide excellent service to all!!  Mari with tours is top notch, got us the best tour guide Manuel, he made our week.  He decorated van for one of our travel members for her birthday,  gave her a bouquet and sang las mananitas!!  AWESOME surprise to our group! Highly recommend Manuel and Mari for all tour arrangements."
50,"We are so happy with our decision to stay at Hotel Santa fe.  First the staff.. friendly and helpful. Second .. the design, very old world charm with lots of balconies and steps. Third.. the food.. breakfast and dinner all week.  Never went anywhere else.  2 pools. Priced right. On the beach. quiet and clean.  Enough said"
40,"Super friendly and helpful staff, spotless constant cleaning during the Coronavirus crisis... a friendly iguana stalks the gardens, lovely food, relaxing and central location. The spa up the road is highly recommended too!"
50,"Great staff, best location, good full service restaurant with stunning views of the surf and sunset. Classic, with two pools, elegant landscaping, good rooms. Could use a little plumbing/bathroom updating, but it was not gross or bad … just a bit outdated with lovely hand made ceramic tiling. It was pretty hot for us San Franciscans during our stay (80F+), so the pool was spectacular relief. Walkable to all of Puerto Escondido. OK - one Sat. morning we were awoken at 6 a.m. by an evangelist street preacher with a very loudspeaker who went on and on for 1 hr … but I don't fault the hotel for that. I shouted at him to no avail … he had The Word to share with all, even if they didn't want to hear it.   ANECDOTE: I left two drawers of clothes in my room. I called them from Oaxaca …"
50,"Hotel Sante Fe is a delightful place to stay and enjoy the vibe of a lovely Mexican Inn, filled with wonderful swimming pools, a delightful restaurant, a superb and caring staff, and a real attempt to be mindful of sustainability.  We loved our stay and would recommend a short walk down the street to Flor de café, a coffee shop with extraordinarily good coffee!"
40,"The place is beautiful, with perfect location and kind and attentive service.  Nonetheless, they could improve the following:  mattresses are old and pillows are hard (after a 6 day stay my back is killing me),  pools are freezing cold (please spend more money on heating, guests will appreciate that) and front desk ladies are very nice but with a NO attitude that could be changed for a more flexible and empathetic approach   Food is great!"
50,"Stayed here for 2 nights during a birding trip in the area.  Perfect spot to relax and sleep.  Loved the 2 pools, especially the adult/lap pool.  Restaurant was convenient and provided delicious dining options for lunch and dinner (we were up too early for breakfast).  Grounds and buildings are beautiful."
50,"Loved this place.  The staff are super friendly,  they organise anything you ask for and are really attentive.  The pool is perfect for chilling out and it has a really relaxed atmosphere.  The rooms are air conditioned and spacious. I would really recommend those place"
50,"Myself and a girlfriend Initially booked for a few nights here. When we first walked In the first thing I noticed was how amazing and friendly ALL the staff were. Then I looked around and It looked exactly like the pictures they had provided (which for us rarely happens!)  We ended up booking 5 nights extra than what we originally planned!  It’s such a peaceful, welcoming environment with everything you need! They also provide a communal fridge to keep your things and a kitchen with everything you need If your wanting to cook yourself.  The breakfast Is so cheap and everything we ordered was perfect!  Perfect quiet location with a 40 pesos taxi into Zicatela. Could not recommend this hostel more! "
50,"Room was very clean and comfortable, and the location in walking distance to a great fish taco spot, a few beaches, and the downtown area. The pool was also SUCH a nice addition, and we used it every day. Awesome value for money and would definitely stay here again!"
50,"This is a great hostel/hotel. It's impeccably run (great owners, staff, etc.), and it's a great place to meet other travelers. It's also got a solid location close to beaches and restaurants. The place is truly a gem. Can't recommend it enough."
50,"Simple, spare rooms with a bit of style. Really good deal for the price, a/c, and the location can’t be beat. There’s a hostel in part of the hotel and a pool with a funky vibe, but the rooms are comfy for adults looking for R&R. "
50,"This hostel has a very high standard, almost a hotel with a kitchen and dorms ;) the location is nice, 7min from the ADO terminal, 5min from the beach (playa Manzanillo/Puerto angelito), close to good restaurants. The hostel is very clean, has a nice kitchen, the pool is great and clean, the 4bed dorm spacious with comfy mattresses (just 1 bunkbed), very strong wifi everywhere and friendly staff. They also have a bar in the evening, reasonable priced, great atmosphere! Just everything was perfect, we would definitely come again and recommend it. Muchas gracias!"
50,"We stayed here for 5 nights and have to say... this was more than just staying in a nice hostel. We found friends here! The staff is amazing, so friendly and always having fun with the guests. The people who stay there are so chilled and almost like a family. Everyone shares their stuff and we loved to have a cooking session all together in the nice kitchen of Losodeli. When it gets too hot on the beaches, that are in walking distance to the Hostel, the pool area spends a lot of shade and we loved to chill there and play pool games or just have a coconut and a power nap haha. The rooms are clean and cozy and also the dorms are really nice and clean. We also loved the breakfast options, the food was really good. Thanks for the nice time in Puerto Escondido, we don't wanna leave :("
50,"This place is essentially perfect. Nice grounds and pool area with an interesting younger-trending crowd. The accommodations range from simple hostel to large 1 BR apartment...we had the latter. It was modern, clean, and quiet with a large-ish private terrace. The property sits adjacent to a large rather busy street on one side, but you'll hardly notice once within the grounds. There are some roosters in the immediate vicinity...nature's most infamous alarm clock.  The location provides great pedestrian access to Playa Carrizalillo and a nearby stretch of good restaurants. We personally found this to be much more our speed than the beach scene of Zicatela and surrounding, though we didn't investigate such deeply."
50,"It felt one more time again like coming home!! Super clean,really nice stuff and an awesome time.... the pool area is quiet and realixing. It's a super safe place and even if you want to do party, the check that it's quiet! The stuff is super nice and helpful!!!not to forget the owner; she is amazing and give the people the feeling be home and like a family. She helps with everything, what ever you try looking for, she try's to get an answer in 30 minutes! I love this place and always like to come back home! Thank you guys!!!!i always have an awesome time there, with all of you! And the rooftop has the best sunsets!!!"
50,"Really good hostel.stayed there a few nights.forgot my e book,they kept it for two months until I went back. Super friendly staff.just 5 minutes to the beach.I felt like home. Thanks again for the e book Sebastian"
40,You can see magnificent sunsets from the ground of the hotel. The rooms are large and quiet. The restaurant serves great shrimp tacos.  But the hotel is a bit far away from the action though everything is accessible with a short taxi ride.   
40,"This is a very nice hotel.  We stayed here for 3 nights.  Our room was clean, airy and spacious with good A/C.  The pool was really fabulous with great views of the sea and it was never crowded when we were there in early February.  The restaurant was by the pool and a very pleasant place to eat breakfast, which was included in our room rate.  However the service at breakfast was very, very slow and not very friendly.  We didn't eat in the restaurant other than breakfast so I can't comment on the food.  The hotel is in a pretty good location.  It's close to the bus station and I think it's not far from the airport.  There's a couple of good restaurants close by (Paris Bistro is particularly good). Bacacho beach is a 5 minute walk and is really nice an quiet but you can't swim"
40,"Its a large piece of property with an amazing pool, helpful staff, and very relaxing atmosphere.Would stay there again! It's close to great restaurants and you can actually walk to them(less than a mile) or grab a very inexpensive cab!"
50,"This is our second time at the hotel and we would return again. It's simple and great value for money. The rooms are very large and the pool area is quiet, great for relaxing Finally view of the sunset is amazing. "
50,"One of the better Hotels in all of Puerto Escondido, but with the bonus of having A/C (many do not), and reasonable prices. As a bonus, the rooms and grounds are kept pristine and the garden is an Oasis. Hotel staff was attentive and professional with the exception of the restaurant staff (granted they work extraordinary long hours). Although the restaurant is clean and well maintained, the food was average, but service is extraordinarily slow; even with no other customers it would take an average of 10 minutes for a waiter to arrive at my table to take my morning hot tea request (stayed 9 days, ordered the same tea with a side of milk every day, and the same waiter would meander out and politely ask what I would like, as if he had never seen me before). Their Pina Coladas are"
20,"Maybe I had high expectations for a place that was a 3.5 star hotel. At first, I realized that our room key was actually a key (not electronic) as you might usually expect.   The building itself is very old and needs to be renovated. There are no frills here, the lighting in the management photos definitely makes it look better than it is...the floor, paint on the walls and room design leaves something to be desired. There was one outlet close to the beds, another indication of an old construction, also one of the lights would flicker long after being turned off.   It's very close to the airport and close to Bacocho beach. There's the 'liberation of the turtles' really close by, which is nice. The beach might be less crowded, but you can't swim in the water because of the rough"
50,"This is a clean and confortable place, the people is very kind, and the common places are very good  The food is expensive, but you can go to downtown, or in the beach  It has a great view of the ocean, I recommend hire the breakfast with the stay"
40,"Stayed just the one night to be close to the airport. Impressive features and lovely, well kept pool. Rooms really well kept and the pool facing room we had was great for sunset.  Staff friendly and there's always someone at reception. Breakfast was included but a little disappointing.  The scrambled eggs and chorizo was a little flat and only black coffee. "
30,The pool area was the highlight of this hotel.  The hotel seems to be popular with Mexican or Spanish speaking honeymooners.  For international non- Spanish speakers it can be a challenge as staff do not speak English.  Rooms basic. A/C works well as does the WiFi.  Beauty Spa very basic (give it a miss).  Local maps & brochures of local attractions are not provided.....thankfully there was access to TRIPADVISOR via the wifi. 
30,"The rooms are clean & spacious. The grounds are tasteful & gorgeous bedded into quiet surroundings with a beautiful view of the sea.   The one bad thing about this place is their restaurant. Firstly: the food is one of the worse I have had in Mexico. Secondly, I saw the waiter handle ice for beverages with his bare hands which is unhygenic & disgusting. In general the restaurant personell seems woefully untrained & not very customer oriented.  I was charged for filling my hot water bottle which I needed for health reasons - with tap water. Ridiculous. Given that this place is out of the way, be aware that you need to be OK with having bad or no restaurant service. "
50,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks, Nov 18-Dec 9, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The room we had was very nice & spacious, the staff was excellent - and if you needed anything all you had to do was give them a call or stop by the front desk, the restaurant right below our room had excellent breakfast & good drinks while sitting poolside.   We had a view of the most spectacular sunsets from our friends' top floor penthouse!  It was a great location to walk around Zicatela, many restaurants/bars on the strip to eat, & to travel to other beaches or to go up town was only a short cab ride away.   We had a full kitchen so could always eat in also.  We loved walking the beach in the morning which was right outside the Hotel.    We would recommend it and if we are ever lucky enough"
30,"Staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are nice but at some days (and nights!) it is very loud due to music around the area/street or aircons running. Breakfast was average, omletes are ok. Some more hangers in the rooms would be nice. Yet the place and rooms are very clean. At the beach there are not enough sunbeds/umbrellas and some mats are missing!"
50,"Me and my 10 year old daughter spent a week at Hotel Rockaway. It was wonderful.   Location couldn't be beat...directly across from the beach, tons of options for food around the hotel!  The hotel itself was well kept. The staff were wonderful! Our room was a good size with a kitchenette. Balcony was HUGE with seating and a hammock. I got extremely sick from an ear infection the day before we were to fly home. Staff at the hotel got me in to see an ear, nose and throat doctor immediately.   The pools were clean and not very busy.   We will return!"
50,"We went there for the wedding of a good friend of ours, we Arrived late that day because of the plain delay, we were tired and grumpy so we went straight to bed.  When we woke up the next day OMG what a beautiful place we were, it is a small hotel, but have all you need when you are at the beach a nice bed, a clean bath and super friendly staff.  It is definitely a good place to getaway for a long  weekend   "
50,"Sort of like a mini-resort, but way more mellow.  Clean, quiet, spacious rooms with nice interior garden courtyard views.  Breakfast was tasty and easy.  Great pools, great location.  No real ocean/beach views."
40,"Went there on business.  Good AC, good bed and iffy wifi.  The bar is well stacked and the staff is super friendly. Good food too.  The only knock is the parking.  I would suggest valet parking, but, that´s just me.  Cheers."
50,"We only stayed here for 1 night so my review is limited but we had a fantastic stay. We booked apartment 1 with two bedrooms, full kitchen, living room and great view of the ocean. We spent the day at the pool which was great and ordered food and drinks around the pool area with great service. Before we decided to stay here we asked the manager to show us some of the rooms and without hesitations he showed us four different rooms and was very friendly. It was a very clean and modern hotel!!"
50,"Really nice hotel, great furnishings. Super staff. THis hotel is right on the main strip at Zicatela beach, close to cool bars, but inside the hotel it is a nice little oasis. I was surprised at how nice the rooms were for the price."
50,"We spent 3 nights in the Rockaway Hotel. The hotel is perfectly located right by the beach of Zicatela as well as restaurants and bars in the area. Our double room was huge and the big bed was super comfortable.   What was outstanding is the staff. My partner and I have our own company in the UK so we had to do some work in the mornings usually, the wifi throughout the hotel is good for social use but not steady enough for business calls etc. The team around the front desk invited us into their office with super wifi without hesitation and we could spend hours in there looking after our business. This is super rare and highly appreciated. They would always try and help you wherever they can with a smile on their face. Would not hesitate to return."
10,"Terrible service! Very rude front desk manager. Hotel has a huge WATER problem! Showers are terrible, and hot water supply is very limited! When asked for help to solve the WATER issue they said that all the hotel had the same problem and they couldn't do anything about it. They also didn't offer anything in return to compensate! DO NOT OVERSPEND ON THIS HOTEL!!!"
40,"Stayed at Arco Iris several times during a low budget surf trip in September 2009. After having stayed for two nights at the poor bungalows at Rockaway, we decided to look for something better. We got a bargain price of $45 (low season) for a double room, which was way better standard than the crappy bungalow that did cost $30. Nice oceanview and good breakfast at the restaurant. Friendly host. The hotel had signs of lack of maintenance and could be cleaner, but overall we had a nice stay for a desent amount of Pesos. We used this hotel as our ""base"" during this trip. Good hooks on the balcony for your hammock, as well:-) Note: The hotel did not take credit card, so we had to take a taxi to Puerto Escondido to find an ATM."
40,"We have stayed at the Arco Iris, Santa Fe, Hotel Ines -- and prefer the Arco Iris.  We have been many times.  It's the best combination of value and comfort. Facing the surfing beach, Zicatela, it is well-located and a short walk to many great places to eat. I have had no trouble making reservations by emailing Rebeca at [--].  She responds promptly and we have always gotten the rooms we liked. The restaurant has a great view and is a convenient place for breakfast, even though we usually eat elsewhere for lunch or dinner. We usually pay $65 - 80 a night depending on how many people we have in our room (we have kids), which is about half the price at the tonier Santa Fe.  The rooms are furnished with wooden beds, Saltillo tile floors, bright talavera tiled bathrooms and all the"
40,"Arco Iris was very clean, has beautiful gardens and pool. The room with 2 double beds was cute, with sconce wall lights plus lamps, a small refrigerator, air conditioning (which we needed!), and a pretty tiled bathroom. Great balconies with a good view of Zicatela. Good restaurant, also with a view. Only downside was walking up 5 levels to get to the room with a view!"
10,"We arrived at the hotel, not having booked in advance and were told that they had rooms available for the week and that they also had Internet connection throughout the hotel.  It was crucial for me to be able to connect to the Internet for work while I was there.  They told us that we had to pay upfront for the room, for the whole week. I was very nervous about doing this, and did not think it was a good idea.  But my friend assured me that it would be fine.    As soon as we checked in I checked for internet service, and there was none.  So I went down to the front desk guy again and told him that the Internet was not working. He said that he would call a guy about it, and that it should be working by that evening.  To make a long story short, by the next afternoon there was"
50,"We originally booked our stay in Escondido at the Villa Bel mar Down the street. It was terrible and I gladly gave up a nights fee there to look for better digs. We came across the Arco Iris and experienced Jupiter( day manager) He said he had a room available but we looked around the strip anyway only to come back and book for a week. It was a great stay! Ocean Views, a great restaurant for sunsets and an attentive staff. I really have nothing bad to say about the place. Great location, service, crashing waves day and night and affordable rooms. Jupiter, Pronounced ""Hoopiter, like the planet"" ( pointing skyward) was the best. He got us everything we needed!!! Will return soon! F&R "
20,"My daughter and I stayed here in July 2005.  Aside from the view, which is tremendous, we were very unhappy.    The room was $80 -- a price at which I expect at least cleanliness, drinking glasses, and decent towels.    Our bathroom and shower were dirty, including sand and spiders in the shower.  We were given only two very flimsy, nearly ragged towels, and when I asked for another towel the housekeeper said,  ""Well, how many of you are there?""  ""Two,"" I said.  ""Well then, you only get two towels,"" she said, and walked away.  !! (and I am bilingual in Spanish, very friendly, and was travelling with a seven-year old!)  I had to ask for water glasses, and she brought only two (no surprise there).  The overhead fan did not work well and we sweltered throughout both our nights"
40,"After a nightmare the day before, we toured Puerto looking for another hotel. We saw quite a few. Hotel Arco Iris were prepared to deal on the price. Rooms are a little shabby, but very clean and neat. Place has a warm familiar feel to it. Walkways and gardens are lovely. Restaurant has excellent food - wait staff are ok but need to be a little friendlier. Reception staff were good - Julietta in particular, was a very sweet person and extremely helpful. Be careful of the bug screens - we had mosquitoes in the room and discovered they were coming in under the screen door / door. This was easily remedied by placing a rug between door and screen door - blocking the gap. Hotel has a nice pool. A very quiet peaceful place. Our room faced the street and we had no problems with noise."
40,"We read about Arco Iris at this forum and were thankful to all previous advisers. We though checked a few other hotels before checking in at Arco Iris, they first had no free rooms at main building and those rooms are the best. Then once a room was available we moved in and had best one week there, though originally planned to stay just 3 days, did not want to leave. Of course bugs can be an issue in Mexico, it is Mexico after all, but guess just don't expect it to be a German business class hotel,  broken masquito nets on windows can be easily fixed with tape or also most rooms have bed mosquito nets available.This hotel location is best, personnel is friendly and smily. Also hotel has a lot of character of a tropical hotel (being simply but conveniently furnished and really"
20,"I had to check out of this hotel after one night. Our room didn't have AC, so we left the windows open, with the bug screens.  I woke up the next morning and (I'm not exaggerating here) I had 100 mosquito bites on my right arm (since I slept on my left side.) After inspecting the windows, the bug screen behind the curtain had a huge hole in it.   We checked out and went to another hotel immediately.  On the positive side, their restaurant is great. Great food, and it is in a perfect location on the beach. Just watch out for the bugs! "
50,Hotel Arco Iris was absolutely amazing. Every day that I am in this office I just keep thinking about how long it will be until I can go back. The staff was awesome (ie Jupiter) and the food was great! All I can say is that I left my heart there. If you get a chance go see Maika

Ordered 3 Don Julio Añejo tequilas at 180 pesos each (9 USD), but then caught the bartender pouring Cuervo Reposado that sells for 110 pesos. Why the dishonesty? I don't get it? Is the owner aware of this?  After confronting the waiter, he said only the last one was Cuervo and adjusted my bill...  tip = zero"
50,"The best hostel in Puerto Escondido! Very homey, warm, amazing and friendly team. Cool and beautifully decorated rooms, large and spacious rooms. verry good vibe. There is an excellent restaurant in the hostel and Nico owner's an amazing man! highly recommend! "
50,"We had an awesome time in PE, we just loved this uncomplicated, quiet, safe and beautiful place. Good food. The most friendly staff. Nice rooftop. No warm water, but with tap water at 30 degrees - no need. Easy to reach the center by taxi (5 min, 35-40 pesos) and la punta by walking (15 min).  We just love you, Nico!"
50,"I have no words to describe the magic of this place. I'm no hippie but this place had good vibes exerting from it 100 feet away.  From the beautiful Amwen greeting us with a brilliant smile and helpful tips to Nico being the most badass person on this planet to beautiful bungalows and serene sorroundings, One Love has exceeded ALL my expectations.   This place is a MUST if you want to find a really chill and cool place. People super mellow. Drinks are great. Atmosphere perfect.   Just wow.   Just wow."
50,"This hostel ticks all the boxes. It's cosy, clean, everything works, it's close to the sea, it has a terrace with ocean view, hammocks, a tropical garden, a nice bar and lovely staff! One can clearly see that the owner fulfilled his dream of creating this hostel well thought through and with a lot of love for detail! I'd go back anytime!!"
50,"I stayed a few nights at One Love in May and I enjoyed it loads. I had a bed in the girls' dorm which sleeps four. It's a little on the small side and ventilation could be better in the sweltering summer months but the beds were comfortable, it was very clean and they had big lockers for all the important stuff.  It's set in a really pretty garden which gives it a feeling of seclusion and tranquility. There's small verandas outside, with hammocks for chilling and a place to hang up wet surf suits and store your board ;) The best part might be the rooftop, sheltered by a palapa and with lots of hammocks overlooking the ocean. There's a nice breeze up there and a good place to be if you just want to have some alone time. They also do free yoga classes there several ties a week"
50,Super nice facilities! Lolol is an absolute sweetheart... Owner and staff really go out of their way to make you feel at home! Just like 30 second walk to the beach!!! We loved it! I'll be back next year!
50,I had such a great stay at One Love. Nico and the rest of the staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful! The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. I stayed in one of the dorms which was lovely with only 4 comfy beds and our own bathroom. The hostel itself is small and really charming with a great location just steps away from the beach and close enough to nightlife etc.  Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Puerto Escondido!
50,"Punta Zicatela in Puerto Escondido is a surfers point. The waves are strong. But there are many other beaches nearby (10 min by public transportation -pickups fitted with seats on the back) where you can enjoy calmer waters.  One love hostel is an excellent choice to stay and make small day trips regardless of your choice of beach. It has all the comforts an expensive hotel would have (the beds and pillows are clean, fresh clean towels, polished cement floors with pebble designs -so nice to walk barefoot- bathrooms are clean and well built, a lushious garden, a beautiful bar and restaurant) and cheaper options for the budget traveler. 3 of the rooms are meant to be shared fitting up to 4. They have lockers and bunk beds, also a small outside kitchen if you really want to save up"
50,"My boyfriend and I traveled in November and stayed in the Bob Marley room. The rooms are so nice and tidy, with such a simple and creative look. I felt like I was in a hotel. I learned that Puerto Escondido does not have warm water in their showers, but it's not like you need it. It is warm enough to dry off quickly and if you got too hot from activities, you always jump in there to cool off or put your fan on.   There is nothing negative to say about this place, it truly was a gem that I was lucky to find. The owner is WONDERFUL she designed the place herself and put so much thought and effort into every little detail. She was so lovely and always had time to chat with me/let me know what the best tours/places in town were.  This place might look a little out of the action of"
40,"I really enjoyed staying at One Love Hostel, stayed longer than planned. I was travelling solo and stayed in a 4 bedroom dorm with a great private bathroom. The food is very good too. However I missed a real hang-out area as solo traveller, where everyone comes together. Only the restaurant is available and the patio.  Nice location, easy travelling to the center with the local 'buses' which are acutally pickups. Don't take the expensive taxi's as proposed by the staff."
10,We had a great stay until we let our luggage in the room to go to chedrau. We were gone 30 min and my luggage was literally broken in to. My security combo lock busted !! I will never stay again. Nothing was stolen. I think we surprised them upon return . the staff work together I'm sure.
50,"Check out the Hotel El Mirador Facebook page for incredible low season specials. It is seriously the best option in Puerto if, like us, you prefer to stay centrally and hang out with the locals. Comfy beds, two great swimming pools and incredible views out over Zicatela. The location is perfect with Super Che and Centro just across the road and Playa Principal an easy 10 minute walk down the hill. It's quiet and a total winner."
40,"I really have nothing negative to say about BZ. Our room was clean and comfy. We had a great view of the sea. The pools are fine, though a jacuzzi in the main area would be nice. The staff was generally helpful and friendly. We didn't visit the restaurant, so N/C on that. But basically, it doesn't get the 5-dot recommendation, because it doesn't have that certain something that really makes a place special -- or at least we didn't see it. That said, the price is well worth it. Prime location."
40,"We had a double seaview room with a balcony overlooking the surfing beach.  There was some street noise as it's in a central part of town but we didn't have any trouble sleeping.  The room was large and clean with Mexican furnishings and a fridge.  The loo had a shower only.  The breakfast which was included daily at the onsite restaurant was fab.  There are lots of separate and lovely pools which we loved, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We couldn't figure out the air conditioning at first but staff quickly helped out.   We also were able to order room service one night which was fab."
30,"We booked direct with the Bungalows Zicatela and found our stay quite average but nothing more. Hotel front desk staff were a bit of hit and miss - and several of them generally unhelpful when wanting information, a dinner reservation made or a taxi arranged at a certain time. Restaurant staff were great as was the breakfasts we enjoyed.  Room 44 is where we stayed and it was fine - but we could not use the patio because of the pigeons and pigeon dropping that was never ending. The maid tried her best to clean but its a reoccurring problem.  Maid service in the room was excellent. This hotel has a palm fringe lining and the birds roost under it and on the top air conditioning units - beware if using the A/C and the higher rooms. We would stay again but not in any room under the"
50,"What a wonderful experience staying at this Hotel was.  You couldn't get any closer to the ocean or the action then you do when you stay at the Bungalows Zicatela.  Marco is the young man who is responsible for making sure his guests are treated with high respect.  Whatever your desire for room accommodations, they can be found here.  The staff are plentiful and gracious.  The restaurant's food is good and delivered in a timely fashion.  Gonzales and Suzy made sure of that.  Your laundry can be done and same day service is the norm. Many other restaurants and shops all around you to satisfy that inner need and of course, the ocean which is literally only a few steps away.  Wonderful hotel and my recommendation to anyone wanting to feel safe and comfortable for an affordable"
40,"We stayed here for several days and had a great time chilling by the pool or watching the sunset from our balcony or the rooftop balcony. While a little older, the rooms were nice, big and clean, would stay again. We had an issue with our airconditioning at one stage and after they tried to fix it they upgraded us immediately to another room."
50,"We booked this hotel last minute and were really impressed with what we got. The room was generously sized, very clean, air conditioned (+ a fan), the pools were a great bonus post-beach and the location right across from Zicatela beach made late afternoon cervezas while watching the surfers a daily routine for us. The staff were very friendly and attentive and the restaurant was perfect for breakfast each morning (included with our rate and was a GREAT value). Would totally recommend for an easy-going beach holiday."
50,"Our room was poolside. No air conditioning necessary. The location couldn't have been more perfectly located to the beach and essential shops.  The big surprise was the complimentary breakfast - it was cooked-to-order and very, very tasty. We were so impressed, most of our meals were taken in the hotel. The Mayan chef did a very good job - combine that with the open, oceanview floorplan, and you've got an absolute winner!  The rooms were not particularly special, but quite comfortable and very functional for a beach hotel.  Bungalows Zicatela is highly recommended."
40,"I do love this hotel:huge top floor ocean view room;can do staff,ask and you shall receive,but even with a nice dinner and a sensational ""surfer"" breakfast the following morning I checked out after just one night.The reason was simple,couldn't sleep due to the music until way too late.Such a shame because I enjoyed a delightful afternoon by the pool,the manager came with me to select a wonderful room and we thought that,with the double glazing,and with 2 sliding windows the noise wouldn't be offensive.However,even with the ac on,once the music began at midnite that was that!Bottom line,really well run hotel with an excellent staff,lovely environment,good food,fair price.Wish I could've slept!"
40,"Bungalows Zicatela in Puerto Escondido is owned by my favourite hoteliers in Zipolite at Hotel Playa Zipolite.  A friend has been staying there for several weeks and we travelled to PE to escort him back to Zipolite for a few days.  Bungalows Zicatela is a very impressive hotel complex offering a variety of accommodations from rooms to self-contained suites.  Our friend is staying in one of the bungalows - two bedrooms, kitchenette, and a very large terrace overlooking the beautiful interior courtyard, featuring  several swimming pools, a fountain waterfall and a restaurant.  We were told that service is impeccable and the staff is very helpful.  These are family qualities also reflected in the Hotel Playa Zipolite.

The rooms we had on the top floor facing the courtyard were large,clean,had a small fridge,hot water and AC that worked.Anytime we asked for anything, from wine glasses to towels was always done with a smile.Being in the courtyard noise was never an issue.The pools were a great place to cool down. We usually  only stay at a hotel for 3 or 4 days and then move on just"
40,"I stayed here for a week with my family of five adults. Perfect spot to get away for a relaxing holiday. Bedrooms are designed in a traditional Mexican manner. Pool areas are beautiful, beach on your door step with spectacular views of the sunset in the evening. Massages and beauty treatments available in each bedrooms which was a real treat. There is a lovely travel agent onsite giving excellent guidance on tours and trips as well as local restaurants. Restaurant onsite is mainly vegetarian and Seafood, cocktails are top class. Bring your bug spray while traveling in this area."
10,"So many things wrong with this hotel, we called 2 days before (within our change/cancellation policy) to change our checkin date to a day later. Every time we called, we were told to call back as the reservationist wasn't in. When we finally were able to track down the elusive reservationist we were told that we were out of the timeframe to make any changes without a fee. Ok, fine.   We unfortunately splurged on a junior suite thinking we were going to be getting a nicer room. We also were thinking that because we were suppose to checkin a day earlier, we would possibly get a better chance at a nicer room. Nope. We got stuck in room 8 junior suite, which automatically hits you with a powerful mold scent, faces the street and parking area and bed is hard as a rock. When i asked"
50,"Good location at quiet end of beach. Nice shady pools, perfect to counter act the heat. The view from the terrace was fantastic.  spacious rooms and great architecture. I would definitely recommend this to others.  "
50,"Loved this hotel! The buildings, grounds and rooms were very well maintained and very pleasant. The pools and surrounding landscaping is beautiful and serene. Staff is friendly and helpful. Good proximity to the beach and restaurants. The hotel restaurant is a pleasant space, but the food is quite average. I think the Mexican cuisine dishes are the better choices. I would stay here again anytime."
40,"The location is on the the beginning of beach boulevard, so it's very quiet and you are at a a walking distance from everything.  The rooms are with enough space, with a Mexican decoration, in general it was very clean, but the toilet has some stains.  The AC works properly and it also has a ceiling fan.  All the staff has a high service level, the food in the restaurant is really good, but a little more expensive than other restaurants in the area.  It has two swimming pools, one for adults only.  It's not a must, but we can come back."

50,"Stayed here for 5 nights in April and can't really fault it. Not expensive (for European tourists anyway) for the quality of the room and location. We just had a standard room rather than a suite and the room was very spacious, nicely decorated, good bathroom (though the arrangement of the shower did mean that the floor outside the cubicle tended to get flooded and also one morning when we had to get up at 6am there was no hot water... Strangely this happened to us at another hotel too... Therefore not sure if it is common for boilers in Mexican hotels to be switched off overnight... Anyway it was no big deal).  Nice little balcony also. As the hotel has lots of outside seating and terraces i don't see the point in staying in a suite as you're probably be spending most of your"
50,"I put this place on. the attention to the client is maganifica, the foods that offer the best quality that you can see. a STAND BY place on the beach. the room very comfortable. There is massage service. the price of the room very accessible. a comfortable place for SIT DOWN to see the view."
40,"This is a really nice hotel, with a traditional Mexican ambiance. My room was large with a cathedral ceiling and a small deck with an ocean view. The food at the restaurant was great and I ate there every night even though I had originally planned to go to other restaurants in the area. Beautiful view from the main patio. Nice mix of guests, everyone was friendly and laid back. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
50,"By the beach, wonderful atmosphere, reasonable prices, two nice pools, well kept, great restauant wonderful view, helpful staff. My wife and I loved it and will be back in 2020. The retaurant choices nearby are plentiful and wonderful. Sunests are breathtaking. Only issue was noice from bands off the property so ask about room location. English can be limited at the front desk but staff try hard to be understood."

Upon arrival (after 4 days on the road) we were told the room we had reserved wasn't large enough for the extra bed. The manager, Carlos, was called. He immediately handled the situation, changing us to a larger room, with no up-charge, and had a sleeper sofa brought in. That was just the beginning of a very enjoyable stay. The staff is excellent, accommodations more than acceptable (with comfortable beds) and clean. The pool area and grounds are immaculate and the laundry service is fast, efficient and reasonably priced. And above all (for motorcycle riders), the parking was secure. Will definitely stay here again!"

The next morning when we arrived (4 of us carrying 3 surf boArds, 4 large suit cases) they refused to even look for our reservation details. We explained we had booked the night before here at reception but the manger (apparently her name is Marie) didn't even want to have one bar of it. She went on to try offering the rooms to us for more then what we had agreed on the night before and denied any trace of a reservation. I understand that paper work can be misplaced however these people did not even TRY to find it. They simply denied any reservtion at all!! The reception staff at this hotel are dishonest, lack"
40,"This is a very simple hotel. No luxury, no little details. However is clean and cheap. Great for the people that want to enjoy the nighlife in Zicatela. If you are looking for a quiet zone... this is not the place. Is sourrounded by bars and nightclubs.  Consider that internet service in Puerto is really bad. Not even with the hotel wifi you will get signal."
20,This mid range hotel is in a fantastic location on the main strip and opposite the beach in Playa Zicatela. It is surrounded by a variety of great restaurants and the surf break is directly across the road. We were given a free drink on arrival. There is a large tiled pool down the side of the hotel (although has no bar or music). The staff were very helpful with our luggage however did not speak or did not want to try to understand any English and we found this frustrating when trying to check in or ask for any help. The room was clean and large with a TV. The air conditioning did not work. Unfortunately there was a bright street light left all night outside our ground floor room which kept us awake all night. There are no doonas or even light blankets just sheets on the beds.

30,We stayed here for 4 days. Originally my wife made contact with the hotel as she was already in town staying at a different hotel that was next to a bar. So she chose to switch to this hotel for when I joined her. She was given a good deal on a room with a king size bed and advised me to contact the person at the desk via e-mail to confirm our requirements. I wrote to them but after 24hr had not received a reply so I made the booking via bookings.com as my wife advised it was high season and we needed to make reservations immediately. Upon arrival we were given a room with 2 double beds and told that they could not honour the original offer of the king sized bed because I had made this booking via the web site. In this room there was a poorly functioning A/C and a weak 20Amp

My wife and I had the seafood lasagna, was to die for. I do not know how else to describe it. I am a pasta lover. It was just great. My son-in-law had one of their specials which featured chicken and he really enjoyed it. The special came with soup and desert.

Management is attentive and professional. Zicatela has a great vibe and wonderful sunsets."

Pros Great staff - super friendly  Nice areas to hang out - lots of tables in the cafe area, hammocks and a great pool, which only needs a few more loungers  Mango tree - amazing. Constant supply of free mangoes Nice little bar They play films in the bar some nights  Spacious, clean dorms Comfortable beds Extra lockers for when you're storing your stuff before check in/after checkout  Absolute bargain for the quality of the place - recommend booking direct   Cons Location is a little away from everything - 10 minute walk to beach, 10 minute walk to main strip of restaurants, 5 mins to town centre, taxi to Zicatela and Borocho, but very handy for the ADO bus station Social atmosphere was lacking.

50,"From the moment I stepped inside this place it felt like home. Liz and staff are amazing, always friendly and willing to help in any way. The dorms are more like little bedrooms with lots of own space and the pool is something you would expect to find in a luxury hotel. The hostel has been set up in a way that makes it really easy to meet other travelers and the atmosphere is always social and relaxt. The bar area is a great place to hang out at night and on some nights there are things organized such as a salsa class or movie night. Location of the hostel is perfect; close to town, beaches and lots of great little restaurants around the corner. I came to Casa Losodeli for a couple of days and ended up staying for over two weeks. Still miss this place!"
50,"Great clean and beautiful hostel, amazing friendly staff.  Clean pool with cool water. great mango tree with heaps of mangos to eat everyday.   It is more like a hotel than a hostel, but their prices for their amazingly comfortable and clean bunks are even cheaper than other hostels around. Great location very close to both the beach and the market  GREAT STABLE AMAZING WIFI"

50,"This is by far one of the best and friendliest hostels I've ever been to. Beside that there was a bunch of great people around which made the whole stay memorable; the owner Liz, the staff, the pool, the cleanliness and just the whole vibe here is so great. There is   a bar in the evening, breakfast in the morning if you like,  hammocks, the pool...  It's not a party hostel, which I personally like, but still good fun, good to socialise, the location is great to go around easily to bars, the beaches and good food places.... Just loved it here.  "
50,"My partner and I stayed at Casa Losodeli in June. We were referred through another hostel that was booked up at the time. Check in was easy. The staff speak a lot of English and Spanish. They were so helpful. They gave us a map and showed us around. Miguel behind the bar was a gem! Always helping us with small Spanish words and inviting us out at night to bars. Liz was also awesome! Super friendly and willing to help. I got a stomach bug one day and she made up a natural remedy tea that fixed me up straight away. She also went out of her way and gave us lifts from the supermarket back to the hostel in her own car.  Losodeli just had a great vibe, the pool and pool area was good, the Mango trees at the property dropped lots of fresh mangoes, the other guests were fun. It wasn't a"
40,"We booked this place on a whim and I couldn't be happier about it! The rooms are spare but comfortable. Everything is clean, and the other guests are quiet and considerate - even on weekend nights. The air conditioner works just fine, but the ceiling fan was all we really needed most nights.   Unlike most hostels I've stayed in, though, you're discouraged from filling up your water bottle in the kitchen. This was a little surprising - so if you're planning to stay here, you may want to pick up a jug of water at the local market. "
50,"My girlfriend and I went to Puerto Escondido for a week and both of us are very glad that we stayed at Casa Losodeli! The atmosphere is very relaxed and friendly. The staff is incredibly helpful in making recommendations on what to do in Puerto and also very friendly and great to have conversations with. Most people on the staff speak English, so for someone that knows very little Spanish like me, this was a huge relief. Most of the other travelers are young adults from all over the world (Ireland, France, Spain, Canada), and too were quiet friendly. This did not have a party atmosphere, so it was easy to fall asleep at night. There were also some families with younger kids (who loved to play in the pool!), but a vast majority of stayers were in their 20s-30s. The amenities were"

The location is also pretty quiet- apart from the cockerels next door.  The one downside to the location is that it is the opposite end of puerto Escondido to la punta so you have to take a taxi or collectivo if you wish to surf.  The upside is that it is close to excellent local amenities like the market and the supermarkets."
50,"We were planning to stay there for 2 nights but ended up stayed for a week (wanted to stay longer but we had tight schedule ..)   Rooms:  -clean -quiet - spacious (we booked a private room with 2 double beds)  - balcony  - wifi worked perfectly  - daily housekeeping  Service:  - best staffs with great smile everyday, organized, arranged dolphin tour for us and taxi booked for the airport   ⭐️Top tips⭐️  Book the NEW wing (those ones with 2 double beds, if you book for the private room) as we stayed in the old wing for 1 night due to the new ones were fully booked, condition was a big difference but  the price only with 150peso difference, worth to pay bit more for a best experience :) "
10,"This hotel is in a residential neighborhood yet they blast very loud music all day long, They do not care about the community. Do not stay here.   There are lots of places to stay where people are respectful to everyone. This is not that place!"
20,Voor deze prijs kun je ongeveer overal in puerto beter slapen dan hier. Het lijkt wel een goedkoop motel uit een slechte film. Ga hier aub niet naartoe. De bedden zijn verschrikkelijk en er zitten muggen op de kamers. Over de sfeer ga ik het niet eens hebben. Ook spreken de werknemers alleen Spaans. (zelfs frontdesk)
50,"Hotel a un buen precio,  siempre limpio, personal amable,  la alberca muy disfrutable, buena ubicación zona tranquila,  cerca del aeropuerto, las camas no son tan comodas es el único pero que le pongo,  fuera de eso es un hotel que vale lo que pagas"
40,"Nice hotel! The pool was really great and I liked the swim up bar. Our room was always clean and the maids did a great job straightening up the room everyday. The beds were a bit uncomfortable though, you could feel the coils. The bathroom also had a weird smell that would leak into the rest of the hotel room, it wasn't unbearable though. Slow wifi!  Overall, nice safe location, friendly staff and adequate rooms"
40,"El Hotel ha cambiado de nombre a Hotel Albatros, debo comentarles que es sencillo pero cuenta con lo que necesitas para descansar, baño, regadera, cama y alberca.   no te pongas exigente, el precio es muy razonable por lo que te ofrecen.  Siempre limpio y honestos. Olvidamos nuestra cámara fotográfica en el Lobby y fue resguardada y entregada a nuestra llegada. Hago publico mi agradecimiento al sr Celestino y a su equipo que son muy amables y serviciales.  Se encuentra muy cerca de la zona gastronómica y a unas 10 calles del pase nombrado el Adoquín.  Se encuentra cerca de las playas Carrizalillo y Puerto Angelito  Vale la pena. Ojo no es un Hotel de Lujo pero si en verdad quieres descansar te lo recomiendo."
40,"Went there on December and got one of the suites for myself; given the very small price difference with the standard, you get double space and much more comfort.  Simple and neat hotel, good maintenance with some brand new rooms, small pool, and very friendly staff. Food is ok in general, do not get your hopes high on elaborated food (as in Zicatela in general).  I would certainly return to this place if back to Zicatela."
50,"I was delighted with my stay at this spot on Zicatela Beach. The property is well designed and well maintained. It was very clean inside and out. Everything worked well except the WiFi. I complained to Reception but was told that it was standard for Puerto Escondido. He said they had some guest computers connected to the Internet by cable that I could use but I just suffered on. The included breakfast was a substantial spread, enough to carry one through lunch if you went down later. All the staff was friendly and helpful."
50,"Having just travelled with friends to Puerto Escondido, I had an amazing, diverse experience at the Hotel Rockaway. The Rockaway combines the perfect balance of contemporary hotel amenities with a Central American vibe. The staff were courteous, professional, and also knowledgeable about the local area, which was helpful for a few daily tours and activities. Our room was clean and modern as was our entire hotel experience. The only drawback for me (not my friends) was that The Rockaway is located in a touristy part of town. I love the wide array of restaurants surrounding it and close proximity to the ocean, but prefer to be off the 'beaten path'. Fortunately, this area is still not too crowded as Puerto Escondido and the Rockaway are hidden gems."
50,Amazing hotel. Beautiful rooms and bathrooms. I was so relaxed there. Hotel may not have a beach view but when you are a few steps from the beach it's not an issue. Very friendly staff. Hotel is very clean. Couple of clean cool pools available and a small collection of shops. Also there's a spa and tattoo shop available. I can't wait to be back one day
50,"I came to this hotel tired and exhausted from my travels in Mexico. Unfortunately, I was hit with a cold due to lack of sleep and rest. This place brought me back to life. The staff was so kind and the place was so clean! I couldn't make it out the hotel the first day, because I wasn't feeling at my best so I ate at their onsite restaurant. The ladies in the kitchen made me chicken and veggie soup even though it wasn't on the menu and they gave me some fresh squeezed orange juice. The soup and oj were a 20 out of 10. It was really that act of kindness that won me over. Not to mention that my fiance had a great time at the beach which was across the street. I really loved this hotel and I hope to return again one day. The rooms were great, modern and comfy. I can't say enough"
40,"Stayed @ Hotel Rockaway in mid Feb for 3 nights with friends. Check in was great, no issues. Room was fantastic(can't remember the exact room number) but was on the first floor overlooking the pools. The pools are not huge but are great(one deep the other shallow). Rooms are spotless clean, breakfast had lots of selection that we thought was very good. There is a little bar right across from the pool that you can order drinks.  We really enjoyed this area as walking out to the street lots of places to eat or have a beverage or just walk along  the beach. We would return here for sure!"
30,"Nice hotel ,  real clean place and great people taking care of the guests. Breakfast was good with fresh fruit and juice. Right near all the bars and  restaurants The rooms are great, only if the beds where soft they are rock hard "
40,"The gym at Hotel Rockaway in Zicatela is clean with a good variety of equipment.  Three treadmills, four stationary bicycles and a good number of weight machines as well as free weights.  350 pesos monthly or 60 pesos per visit. The music has improved over time - both quality and volume.  Yesterday, I heard a good number of popular songs from the eighties and it wasn't too loud.  On bad days, there is that loud techno boum which really I find unpleasant.  I go at around 11am and it's mostly Canadian retirees.  Maybe 4-5 people.   There are about 18 fitness classes offered weekly but that is a separate fee of 350 pesos monthly or 60 pesos per class.  There are men's and women's lockers as well as showers.  The receptionist will give you a locker key. I've been going for three"
10,"Recently returned from a three week holiday touring Oaxaca beaches from Hautulco to Puerto Escondido and Rockaway was the most disappointing place we stayed. It's across the road from Zicatela beach and you can't see the ocean!!! The owner's suite, a penthouse and the gym get to enjoy the view while the hotel rooms are left to look at one another and the pathetic excuse for a pool. I'm told the hotel was recently rebuilt... They needed a better designer!!! Plus it is way overpriced compared to other hotels around it. We figured because we got breakfast it would make up for it. Mistake!!! Food is perpetually cold - lukewarm eggs aren't appealing ever - and coffee is awful! It's served in this little tiny room that echoes like crazy so forget any peaceful morning routine. And they"
20,Hotel is still under construction. Lots of hammering etc during the day. Things don't work even though it is apparently new/remodelled. Also doesnt have any Mexican charm. They are trying to be contemporary in an area where that doesn't work. People don't  come to Puerto Escondido to have a Cancun experience! There are so many other great hotels on Zicatela that are better and cost much less. Not recommended.
40,"Stayed in Hotel Arco Iris in three (!) months. Had a really good time. Missed air condition the first nights, but not for long.  Nice staff who does almost anything to comfort you. If your ill, ask for popcorn and you get it.... :) Even if many in the staff doesn't speak english they really try to help you. The restaurant doesn`t have the biggest menu, if you ask, the might cook it even if they don`t have it on the menu! Still miss this place... "
50,"1996 was a long time ago...but my memories of the Hotel Arco Iris (arch of the iris -or- rainbow) are still vivid in my mind. Early morning strolls in the gardens behing the hotel, or recovering from a sunburn (be careful) on my breezy veranda... And it is true the staff are very friendly. Enjoy. I wish I could get back there! B.F. in K.C."
50,"and stayed at Hotel Arco Iris, two different times, for two weeks each time. It was great. Didn't want to come home. The rooms were nice, clean, and comfortable. The view was wonderful. The gardens beautiful.  Most of all the food was excellent, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Can't wait to go back."
40,We stayed at the Hotel Arco Iris for two nights in July. It was hot but the breeze and fans made it tolerable. Our hotel room had a balcony and hammock rentals. it was a perfect place to relax. The restaurant had good breakfasts and the staff was very helpful. I would definitely stay here again.
40,"Came in for two nights...finally stayed the whole week at Arco Iris. Warm, smiling and welcoming staff. Great food and drinks. If you don't like cute cats and kittens...it's not the place to stay. Beautiful garden and clean pool. You will be surrounded by palm trees (or course), lime trees, mango trees, papaya trees... Charming rooms with balconies. Hope Stephanie's still there to give a wonderful massage!! Practically located on the Zicatela beach. Surfing and good swimmers will love it. You can find fun bars and at the same time calm restaurants in this area. Can wait to go back!"
50,"I've stayed in Hotel Arco Iris many times since it was built , and have never been disappointed! In fact they just keep getting better. The people there take pride in their work. You will be treated as family even on your first visit. The rooms are large and comfortable with private balconies ( that have hooks for hammocks) and what a view. The restaurant serves great (and safe) food, and don't miss Happy Hour @ the bar."
50,"We were lucky enough to walk by this gem while staying at an AirB&B nearby.  We new we wanted a place in a good neighborhood and close to everything and Madre Tierra is exactly that... The entire town is walkable but this place is exactly where you want to be.... We had a studio with a plunge pool which is great getting used to the perfectly warm weather.  Great restaurants, beaches, and grocery stores.  We needed a secure garage and they have one!!! ALL the staff is excellent and the place is ideal... We stayed for a month!  Madre Tierra has the room size for everyone's needs."
50,"My partner and I stayed at Madre Tierra for 3 nights in early March, 2020. From the start, arriving late at night via bus from Oaxaca, we were impressed. Adan, the property manager, met us at the front door and immediately showed us a beautiful, first-floor suite with a small, private outdoor pool just off the balcony. Because it had only 1 bed (and we like 2 separate beds), we asked to see another room. Not a problem. We slept in the first for night 1, taking advantage of the pool, and then moved to the alternative, helped by the wonderful housekeeper so that we didn't have to break up our touring day.   The entire building is VERY tastefully decorated and one feels very ""4-Star"" there. The rooms are spacious, clean, bright, with great AC, TV and wifi (if you need them). The"
40,"this place is great for the right person.  great location. clean rooms. comfy beds. nice owners. good price.  but then you also have the on-site bistro that can turn into a party until 2 in the morning(hey, let the party come to me!). the concrete repair guys were nice enough to wait until 930 to start pounding away (ah, time for me to get off my lazy rear and start surfing!)."
40,"Well located at the end of the zicatela strip, which is nice as is the quieter end of town. Our room was on the top floor with a gas hob and large fridge freezer and  some cooking utensils. We couldn't have asked for anything more. We planned on staying for a week, but extended to 3 weeks. Only issue is the plumbing, sometimes water would be off. If we go back to Puerto Escondido, we will be sure to stay here again."
50,"Papaya Surf Hotel was just what we were after for our stay in Puerto Escondido. Right across the road from Zicatela beach, pool, Steps away from shops and bars.   We stayed in a 2 double bed room, private bathroom, private outdoor kitchen. Equipped with cooking utensils, cold fridge and freezer, little dining table and outdoor hammock.   I really enjoyed our stay here, house keeping was great, hot shower, steps away from the pool or beach. Beautiful old building a little rustic, seems as though they are renovating to create a bar or restaurant which would be awesome.   If your looking for something a little upscale this place isn't for you but if you want a non expensive piece of privacy with air conditioning, a fan and a pool to keep you cool during the peak  sun hours then"
30,"With some paint & other maintenance I think this place could be pretty nice. As it is the place has a really worn feel, plumbing not always functional etc. On the plus side Marco the owner is a very cool and friendly guy and very flexible with his rates. It is close to all the Zicatela action so expect some noise all night."
50,"this is an a amazing place! the owners and the staff are amazing people they helped me with everything from the first second i got to puerto  untill i left, i came puerto to surf, i was living there 3 months and it was so good no other place like papaya surf in the world...the owners such good people and all the staff as well the place is beutiful with many beutiful trees and plants i was in a room with a/c (i loved my ac!) and it also has a ceiling fan, so good at nights i put the ac on for 1 hour and turn it off and put the fan when the room is cold and go to sleep so good...the room is very beutiful and clean and the ladies there are wonderful allways smiling! allways helps with any thing you need and cleane your room change your bed sheets put fresh towels , 1 day they left"
50,"We stayed here for 8 days on a trip through Mexico from New Zealand and it was one of the nicest places we stayed in all of Mexico. It was just what we were looking for in terms of a relaxed environment, all the essentials and wonderful staff and housekeepers. We often left our room a bit of a shambles and always returned to find the beds made and bathrooms clean and tidy. The restaurant below served fantastic food and great coffee. Thank you so much for making Puerto our top location. We will be back to stay with you :)"
50,"Im travelling with a friend. We got a twin bed room just $200 me ixan pesos each one with kitchen and an excellent bathroom. Only the rooms in the first floor have a kitchen and if u get one of this you can save money from eating in restaurants. There is a supermarket nearby cheaper than every where else called ""super che"" and if you are surfer is the best spot to start the day. Right across the street you find one of the best spots to surf on earth. Also they clean your room everyday because is a hotel."
40,"I would describe this facility as the perfect balance between hotel and hostel. The rooms have the hostel feel. Sparsely decorated, functional. There is an assumption that you will be spending your days surfing, not sitting in your room and watching TV and ordering room service. After all, the beach begins right across the street, and you can see the ocean from just about anywhere in the hotel.  We stayed here two nights in July. It seems to be about 1/3 full. The Terrazzo bar is evidently only used in high season, but the downstairs bar/cafe has been busy.  We got an air conditioned room, but it malfunctioned the second night so the front desk let us sleep in a different room without actually moving all of our stuff! Very helpful and friendly staff."
40,"I moved to this hotel after having a couple of horrible nights in a hotel nearby. The owners are really friendly and let me check in first thing in the morning. The fan operated rooms are spacious, clean, cool and anti mosquito! The hotel is opposite the beach, yet noise proof from the parties in the evening. There is a night watch man which I appreciated as I was a solo traveller. Brilliant value for money, highly reccomend for those that are looking for a simple place to crash and chill in between surfing / beach / exploring area."
50,"I stayed at papaya surf for 8 nights, it was great. Everything just great. I recommend this place."
30,The hotel is across the road from the beach where you will see amazing sunsets. The hotel is currently being renovated so it is a bit run down. There are no lifts so request a ground floor room if stairs will be an issue for you. There was no hot water and our toilet didn't flush. There is a pool in the centre of the hotel. There are a few beach bar/restaurants across the road.  
50,"If your are looking for a great family hotel, this is the one. Service is very good (the owner is always around). Rooms are more than confortable, equipped with celing fan and A/C. This hotel is located just a few meters from the beach and it is located on the main street for bars, restaurants and shopping; the good thing is that it is not in the middle of the loud and crowded places.   This hotel also offers a Co-Working space with Wi-Fi if you want to be in touch with your business abroad.  If you are planning a long stay you can ask for one of the two apartments on the top floor.  Great views from the top floors.  Do not miss this hotel if you are planning a trip to Puerto Escondido"
50,"Best place to stay in Puerto Escondido, 5 min from Zicatela beach, in region of Bacocho, close to Playa Carrizalillo and Puerto Angelito. Nice and big rooms, very nice breakfast, gorgeous pool and spectacular sunset view... And very quiet place, no noise at all!!!"
50,This is such a great place. It is a little way from Puerto Escondido but it costs about 40 pesos to get a taxi there. The hotel is clean quiet and has a fantastic pool and lovely gardens i. The staff are good and helpful. Breakfast if good too. Go there for the price you couldn't find a better place!
50,"So glad we found Aldea del Bazar. It's like a little oasis in PE. Pool is AMAZING. Ocean view is spectacular. Everyone is so helpful and meets you with a warm smile. We came from the Rockaway which was so disappointing (cold, austere, little dinky pool, no sun until 11:00am, and no ocean view) and found Aldea del Bazar and are so happy. Plus it is much less money per night. Do not hesitate to stay here. You won't be disappointed. Peaceful, serene, and oozing with Mexican charm and warmth."
50,"This hotel is minutes from the airport and a real steal when it comes to its prices...  The hotel because it's out of season was almost empty, which was a bonus....So peaceful, you can see the sea for your sunbed.  The staff were all very helpful, I forget suntan cream so they rang the pharmacy to deliver me some. My wife asked for a certain cocktail not on the menu they 'googled' the recipe and made it perfectly.  Really am impressed - It's simple and tranquil and the sunset is just beautiful from the hotel."
40,"The air conditioner was great, and so was the number of tv channels and the pool.  As other people have said the room needed a little work, but it was still fine.  The staff members were very nice and attentive.  A little bit of a walk to restaurants especially in the Puerto heat, but still a nice place."
50,"Stayed here for 5nights in March2015.  This place is serenely beautiful, a short hot walk to local cafes, convenience stores and cheap taxi to just about anything you need.  Reception staff are a little lazy, but restaurant staff are great, food is somewhat uneventful they could really lift their game here, and wow the region, having said that it's like good home cooking and worthwhile.  The pool is amazing, the rooms spacious, clean, basic and comfortable.  Tip is there is no refrigerator!!!  So it is essential to buy a cheap esky, cooler or whatever you call it in your country and buy ice daily.  Hot water???  Great air conditioning.  We could live here.  This place is a winner.  Loved it and want to come back.  Perfect for a wedding!"
50,"We are a family with three young children, and we stayed here one night. This place is fantastic -seriously the quietest accommodation we've had during our 6-week stay in Mexico. The staff are super friendly, gracious, and always smiling. Everything represented on the web-page was accurate. While the hotel is older, with some obvious signs of wear, it is definitely very clean. Safe, off-street parking. Comfortable beds. A/C in rooms. This is very important to us, and we had no concerns about it. Our room had two double beds plus two sitting benches which the kids happily slept on. Huge lawn areas for the kids to run, play and explore, hammocks strung out under coconut palms, large pool. It is located up on a cliff with a fabulous view of the Pacific, but there is a fence to keep"
50,"I needed to spend the night in Puerto Escondido and decided on this property as it looked interesting.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The hotel is older and basic,  but the grounds are beautiful, the ocean view amazing and ever so quiet.  The rooms are very comfortable, bed and linens were great.  Cable TV with lots of channels, fast internet and a great AC.  What more do you need.  The restaurant food was excellent as well , we ate three meal and all were perfect.  The restaurant staff were so kind."
10,"When I booked this hotel through a booking website the name came up as 'Aldea del Bazar Hotel & Spa' and the description emphasised the spa a lot. Unfortunately, the spa is not well kept. It looks very neglected in fact. I had a massage appointment, for which the masseuse arrived late, so I was standing infront of locked spa doors and nothing was prepared. Also, whilst the hotel has the perfect setting for tranquility (gorgeous pool area), it unfortunately allows children, which again is very unusual for a spa hotel. To top it all off, in the evening guests would watch sports in the restaurant, so again, if you were hoping for a tranquil meal it's not happening."
50,"What an odd property.   I've visited Puerto Escondido many times so know to expect that it is not your typical Mexican resort destination. There is a very definite vibe to the place that doesn't scream ""mass packaged tourism"". Maybe this is why I should not be surprised by the Aldea del Bazar, but I still am anyway.   First, the hotel is not in the typical place where most of the hotels are. You are far from Zicatela and Playa Principal, so expect a long walk or very short cab ride. This did not bother me, though you should be careful of the neighborhood at night. It's not dangerous, but there have been instances of petty theft.   The property itself is intoxicating. The architecture is not typical of the Mexican colonial style, but more Middle Eastern / Indian inspired;"
50,"Este hotel me encanto a mi y a mi familia ! A un paso esta la playa, por las tardes puedes caminar sobre la avenida el “ADOQUÍN” y puedes encontrar desde artesanías típicas del estado, buena comida y un excelente servicio por el personal que labora en el hotel, las habitaciones están súper cómodas, acogedoras  y súper limpias.... se los recomiendo al 10,000 de echo ya estamos pensando ir de nueva cuenta.....   Y el precio súper económico !!!!"
10,Our room smelled like sewer gasses. We attempted to air it out but were asked to close the door so we don’t burn out the a/c. It’s 2 in the morning and louder than a rock n roll concert in my room. I’m unable to sleep because the two night clubs down the street are so loud. 
40,"Este es un lugar tranquilo, donde pasar la noche. Muy cerca del mar y sobre la calle peatonal ""El Adoquin"". El costo por una habitación sencilla para dos personas puede ir desde los 350 pesos en temporada baja. Las habitaciones son sencillas pero limpias. En general es adecuado si solo buscas pasar la noche. (servicio de TV Cable, Wi Fi, Clima)"
40,"Este hotel familiar de los primeros de Puerto Escondido cuenta con un extraordinario servicio, excelente ubicación y super buen precio.  Las habitaciones están muy limpias. Y aunque no cuenta con alberca el mar esta a un paso, así que no se necesita. Muy recomendable."
40,"Hotel met uitzicht op de baai en het strand, eenvoudige kamers maar schoon en netjes, zeer goede prijs kwaliteit verhouding, zeer aardig personeel, ligt zeer gunstig aan de voetgangersstraat met restaurants, winkels, bars enzovoort."
40,"I recommend this place to families, friends or couples. The location is directly on the beach, you can go out your room in your swimsuit and enjoy the beach. Zicatela is a surfer beach so is highly recommended not to swim, but the hotel has 3 amazing pools where you can rest, swim or enjoy the jacuzzi. Rooms are huge, we were four with four large beds, fridge and tv. You can choose either fan or air conditioned. Breakfast is included and you'll have coffee and one choice from the restaurant menu.. I usually had yoghurt with fruits and muesli and my friends the ""surfers breakfast"" with eggs, bacon and pancakes! Reception was open 24/7 and everyone was friendly and kind. Maybe once a week the music from the bar next door could be a little bit noisy if you are sleeping, but COME"
50,"We arrived here after walking for nearly an hour from the bus station in 40 degrees heat. We had no idea we were gonna find a place like this and right on the beach! :)  The hotel got everything you need but we took a room with double fan, hot water, tv on the bottom floor towards the pool. Clean room, good temperature in the room, friendly staff and ala carte breakfast included in the price. Take the surfers breakfast which gives you two delicious pancakes, scrambled eggs and bacon with coffee of course. Supposed to stay here for a day or two but will stay for at least four.  Highly recommend this place!"
40,"This hotel has everything you need in Puerto Escondido.  The hotel rooms were spacious, clean & comfortable. The rooms facing the pool were very quiet at night & it is worth the little bit extra for the air conditioning as it made a huge difference to our comfort. The price for the room was great value for its comfort level & location on the main strip in Zicatela.  The pool areas were clean & huge. The restaurant had delicious food although we only found out on our last day that breakfast was included so make sure you ask about this. The smoothies & cocktails were great.  The staff were helpful although the service fits the typical Mexican pace of slow... But your in Puerto so there is no rush.  The beach across the road is great for watching waves & surfers however be aware"
10,"If you'd like to have a relaxed stay and good sleep at night, this is definitely not the right place to stay! We already heard from others that they do often have construction noise (sawing noise) and loud music by the pool, but after looking at all their reviews, we thought me might give them a try as the location is great. The service was friendly so far , but they did not do anything to stop the party that was going on in the hotel day and night. No chance to rest! There seem to be no rules or they just dont care. We will definitely not come back again!"
50,"If your travel destination is Puerto Escondido, then you're probably a Surfer or a bodyboarder. If That's your case, find herein my pro and cons:  Pro - Location. You just need to cross the road and you at the beach where you'll catch one of the most powerful waves ever The hotel has an incredible balcony and a roof top where you'll be able to take amazing pictures  - food. You have to realize that you're in Mexico, so frijoles and some other typical   Mexican food will be part of your daily diet, BUT since you're in Mexico you'll try the real deal! For the tourists that are hard to please they'll have other dishes that will meet you needs for sure  - swimming pool - this hotel is probably one of the few with an amazing swimming pool where you'll certainly relax after  you  hit"
50,"Great place to stay at very reasonable price Many rooms to choose depending your profile. Open to negotiate the price if you stay more days. Nice swimming pool, nice view to sunset, street and waves. You can drink your own beer inside the hotel. Only the breakfast is poor, just tostadas and cofee."
50,"Este hotel esta perfecto si eres un surfista o quieres quedarse cerca de la playa.  El hotel esta limpio y el servicio esta super bien.  Me he quedado allí dos veces y regresaré otra vez muy pronto.  This is the perfect hotel if you are a surfer, it is right in front of the main break in Puerto Escondido. You can even have an ocean view for around 60-90 dollars per night, depending on the day.  The hotel is clean and has air conditioning and the service is great.  I have stayed there two times now and I will be going back very soon!"
40,Quality hotel and restaurant near the ocean. Really friendly staff and clean and nice rooms with a beautyful view on the beachside. Food in the restaurant is realy well and for a good price!! Also a nice swimmingpool available.
40,"I enjoyed staying 4 nights at this hotel in the Zicatela Beach area of Puerto Escondido in February 2014. Travelling on my own, I wanted to be able to chat in English. I found this decent hotel, with swimming pool and restaurant, for $400 pesos a night single.  Just don't expect a Mexican experience. There are a lot of older Canadians and Americans who hunker down here for the winter. I found they weren't exactly the sort of people I wanted to hang out with.  The hotel is just fine: very clean and comfortable with good food available in the restaurant. The staff are wonderful."
40,"My wife stayed here for 2 weeks while on a Global Village Build in the area. Firstly and the ONLY bad thing we would say about the place was her rooms proximity to a Bar across the ally. Once I arrived she joined me on the opposite side of the courtyard and it was much quieter. The service was fantastic, English speaking reception staff was a big plus for the area. The food was very good and not over priced. Location could not of been better. The many pools and fountains gave the inner courtyard a very warm feeling. The staff was very personable and friendly despite our language barriers. Deliveries of fresh fruit, veg, and seafood seemed to arrive sporadically though out the entire day. On several occasions my food was so great that I was compelled to personally advise the"
50,Great little hotel in La Punta. Rooms have a kitchen and fridge which is a bonus. The swimming pool is large and it also has a rooftop terrace to watch the sunset. I would book again. The beach is 30 seconds for the hotel 
40,"Lugar tranquilo, habitaciones funcionales. Son pequeños apartamentos. Limpio. Ojo, tiene varios pisos y no hay ascensor. En la parte alta hay una azotea con vistas a la playa. La piscina/alberca está muy bien, aunque solo hay una ducha. Tiene wifi y aire acondicionado."
40,"El hotel estaba en ampliación con mucho ruido pero hubo previo aviso.  Limpio y cómodo, los empleados amables y atentos, la alberca de buen tamaño y a temperatura agradable. Con gusto volvería.  Un pequeño pero importante detalle, estaba lloviendo en la noche y una puerta/ventana que daba al jardín lateral se “tapó” y se metió el agua a la recámara, mi hija de 9 años se levantó al baño y por el charco de agua acumulado en el piso, se resbaló y pegó en su nalguita, provocándole mucho dolor y llanto, espero arreglen ese detalle."
20,"Stayed for 5 nights in these wooden cabanas surrounding a pool, 2 mins from Zicatela beach.  The pool was pretty dirty and smelt strongly of chlorine, but was a good size. Positioned so there is no sun on it or around it all day.  Was a rat in our room for first 2 nights, something or someone must have killed it because it didnt come after that, although there was a hole in the wall where it had come in. Loads of mosquitos in the area and in the room, mosquito nets are provided. Room had Air con and a fan, but fan only worked on 1 setting.   Hotel staff did nothing to stop people literally shouting in the communal areas till 2/3am, so it provided a terrible nights sleep.  Had hot water for one shower the whole time we were there. They didnt give us towels till the 3rd day. "
50,"We stayed there for a few days and loved it. It is very quiet, there are only a few other cabanas and the pool in the middle is lovely and often empty. We were worried about security but there is always someone taking care of the property during the day so no reason to worry. It is clean but very rough as all made of wood and not coated. Great location, lovely owners, highly recommended."
50,"35 years ago, when he was just a young surfer and wood carver, my brother, Charlie, met Mario Inowe, proprietor of the Acali. Mario was just building his hotel and Charlie has been coming back to Puerto Escondido all these years. Charlie invited me to come with him this trip to Puerto Escondido and stay at Hotel Acali a beautiful, and natural looking property, in a fantastic location right across a quiet street from Zicatela  beach.   The property is lush, surrounded by palms and tropical vegitation of every kind. I had my own large cabana a few flights up the outdoor stone stairs from their sparkling swimming pool.   My room included a small kitchenette and a bathroom with a jacuzzi tub.  There was an air-conditioner but,  I really did not need it at all with gentle ocean and"
20,"The outside of the cabanas look nice, however don't trust the photos on booking.com I.e. There is no kitchen. There is a gas stove outside on a set of drawers which doesn't really work. One pot, a pan, no knives, forks, spoons, plates etc  We arrived and were escorted to one cabana with no privacy whatsoever, so requested to be changed. This was agreed.   New cabana - bathroom dirty, toilet dirty. No hammock, so requested one (as per pics) old hammock with big hole - had no others Very very loud at night with all the cars passing by about 5 metres from the cabana Wifi sketchy  Positives - swimming pool was nice, a stones grow from the beach"
50,"We loved the Acali.  The aesthetics created hidden cabins in coconut palm forest.  The cabins could be considered ""glamping"" but for the price the Acali offers more than just self contained cabins.  Beautiful pool, helpful staff and a great location.  A slice of paradise for sure."
50,"Nice and quiet little cabins with true Mexican flavour Small refrigerator, nice swimming pool and very friendly personnel. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The cabins are rough and give you a true feeling of Mexico.They are across from the beach and many restaurants by the sea. Parking is secure and there is an attendant 24 hrs. It is also pet friendly. We truly enjoyed the place and, if you are not a person who likes the ""all inclusive"" or luxury chains will certainly enjoyed your stay. We can only but recommend this place . It is reasonably priced and a good value for the money."
10,"We made a reservation via Booking.com and unfortunately booking gives a price in USD. I like to pay in MXN, so the guy at the reception had to convert the amount. He tried to screw us there, since he converted 16 MXN for 1 USD (the current rate is about 13). After some discussion we settled at 14. Furthermore the cabanñas: - were filthy - had very bad plumbing (toilet did not work, shower all calcified, no hot water) - some doors wouldn't close - other doors were virtually impossible to open - the windows wouldn't close (so we had to kee all valuables in the car) - curtains blocked the airco - plastic sheets on the beds (guarantees sweaty nights, even in a non tropical climate)  In short: someone is ripping the tourists off and is getting rich by not maintaining the premises. "
40,"When we arrived in Puerto Escondido we had just spent about 10 hours sleeping on a bus from Oaxaca, and arrived  at 7.30 in the morning at a very tiny bus stop. We asked the taxidriver to take us to the Zicatela beach, which we had read was the prettiest one, and asked if he knew a good hotel. He did not, and we ended up asking him to drop us off at the very beginning of playa zicatela. Here we found Acali. We pyed 300 pesos for a cabaña with one double and one single bed, right across the street from the beach. Manuelo, who was the only one awake at that early hour, gave us excellent service and advise and we were in love with this hotel from first sight. We happened to arrive the same day there was a tsunami warning due to the eathquake in Japan, and with no problem or extra"
50,"We went to Playa Zicatela after we found out that it is the best one in North America for surfing, and we were not disappointed. I would rather go there than any beach in CA, not to mention that it is probably cheaper. The Acali was small, and cozy. For the price you can't go wrong. The little cabins are comfortable, and there is a hamock to rest at the end of the day. There is a small bar by the pool, which has beer and some mixed drinks, plus the regular coke and sprite, at probably the best bar prices on the strip. The guy spoke English and gave us info on the area, which made it easier for us to get around. The staff at the desk were fabulous, and there is parking if you are nuts enough to drive (we bused in from Mexico city). They also have the pool which is clean and empty"
40,"This is a sweet spot close to the entry road to the ""surfer strip"" in Puerto Escondido.  There are a number of small cabanas around a clean, pleasant pool, but these offer little privacy, are close to the street, and have no view.  Ask for one of the cabins up on the hillside.  They are quieter, more private, and have a wonderful view of the ocean.  The whole place is kept clean and well-tended (they have lots of jungly plants around to make it feel like the tropics), and each cabin has a private bath.  Some even have (very primitive) cooking facilities.  This is ""backpacker style"" accomodations, but we found it to be more than pleasant.  Beware Monday nights!  There's a disco party next door that goes until 2:00 a.m.  Other nights are quiet, and you can hear the waves break"
50,"Entering this place made me almost cry --- after a lot of different hostel experiences the care and love of this place is simply blowing! This is a 5**** Star Hostel for same price of a regular Hostel.  Moreover Nico and his crew are not only running ""One Love"" but they are living and sharing love, which reminds you that we are all one!  If not for accomodation, try the restaurant...it's AMAZING.  Love from munich"
50,"The place has nice bungalows completely covered by plants and green. It s very quiet and clean. The restaurant is excellent. The owner, Nico, is very nice and explains you all the things you can do around the area. "
50,"Stayed for four nights in a super clean and nice dorm, did yoga on the terrace and had amazing breakfast every morning in the restaurant! Beautiful, green environment with lots of hammocks. Close to the beach and a short taxi ride to the center. Staff is extremely helpful. Highly recommended!"
50,One Love Hostal was one of ten places we stayed during our 3 week trip in Mexico and it was the best for chillout. Staff is very kind and helpful. The owner helps with anything - from surfing classes up to the best ways to spend your time in Mexico. Food is delicious! Definitely worth coming back!
50,"Great location 5 min by taxi from Playa Zicatela, much recommended for travelers looking for a peaceful location. The garden and accomodations are beautiful and the pool is more than welcome on a hot sunny afternoon. Very good wifi everywhere. 10 min by foot to la Punta. Beautiful terrace with hamocs to chill, a little piece of paradise in Puerto!"
40,"We had a 3-night stay in the One Love P.E. hostel during our little road trip on the Oaxacan Pacific coast. We were travelling as a couple so we chose the ""Suite One Love"" for maximum privacy. In this context, the hostel is in no way inferior to a good, medium-segment hotel. The room is on the first floor of a nice Palapa-style cabaña and has plenty of room for 2. It almost was a little bit too spacious as not much of furniture is in the room. The ""kingsize"" bed lives up to its name and is very comfy. The bathroom is also very big and equipped with a huge bathtub which is actually a little bit needles when you have the ocean a few meters away (and no hot water to take a bath, by the way).  The staff is more than friendly and helpful, particularly the girls from the"
50,"Stayed here for a yoga retreat in april and it was perfect. The staff are amazing, the food was good and the rooms were great! The rooftop has such an amazing sunset, just careful there was tons off mosquitos when I was there. To go to la punta is a short walk but I did love it."
50,"We found the One Love Hostal through a recommendation and it was more than worth it. Everything inside it is made with a lot of love to detail, beginning with the comfortable and affordable theme rooms to the one love T-shirts and the yoga classes. We also loved the food in the restaurant, especially the breakfast with a lot of fresh fruits every day. The staff was extremely helpful. They helped us with all our trips and could give us advice. We hope to be back again soon."
50,"We have stayed 8 nights at One Love and couldn't ask for better. The staff is friendly and welcoming, the hostal is clean and cosy and the food is great (the fish meals were ones of the best we had). The roof deck with the ocean view is the perfect place to relax and enjoy the view of the beach and sunset. Highly recommended! "
50,"Great place. Lovely tropical grounds, great food and the daily yoga on the terrace is excellent.   Really enjoyed the personal touch by staff, our highest recommendations.  To top it off, they have a beautiful and friendly cat! "
30,"Our charming fishing village has run out of water.  Mexico has stayed open during the pandemic, and we have felt very safe down here.  The problem is that the word got out and PE has had an unprecedented number of tourists.  Building is rampant, but the infrastructure cannot handle the strain.  The Semana Santo onrush has yet to happen, and no one has running water.  Walk down the Adoquin, and everyone is carrying gallon bottles of water.  Water companies are no longer answering their phones.  As seasonal visitors, it is an inconvenience.  For residents, we can only imagine the fear, concern and threat this poses."
50,"Although we have never actually stayed at the Ben-Zaa, but our condo is a 5 minute walk from there so it is a regular watering hole and place to eat for us if we don't want to cook. Happy hour is great with the same people back there year after year to visit and new people to meet. Margaritas are THE BEST IN PUERTO ESCONDIDO! Food is great although kind of a limited menu. Excellent pizza! Free WiFi. Friendly staff. Please note that Ben-Zaa is a very informal place and kind of like going to someone's home for supper and a party. Just pull up a chair at a table full of people you have never met and introduce yourself.  As the sign on the wall says ""I Love This Bar"". Regulars will know exactly what I am talking about."
10,"The woman running the bar is not very poor pleasant (might say a bit if a snob) she accused us of stealing drinks. She can't seem to run a tab and keep it straight. Very rude !!!!! Don't go if you are a ""working class person "" Bunch of snotty "" rich "" people!!!!!!!"
40,"Former staff members have returned and the kitchen is putting out Steve's old recipes thanks to his former assistant Patty. So, the dinners are very good as well as pizza etc. Of course Maria keeps a close eye and manages to crank out great drinks for her loyal guests. "
30,Still a good value and happy hour maggies. Sadly Steve passed away in a motorcycle accident in the mountains and the kitchen has sufferes. Clashes with family forced cooks to quit. Food is limited and passable.
10,Very dated and run down looking. The other reviews were so favorable we were surprised to read them.  Overpriced for what it was. Must have seen better days.  It does sound like there is a lively gathering happy hour.
50,"I have never stayed in the hotel. I have ate in the little restaurant many times over the past 7 years. Food is excellent and fresh. Maria is an absolute gem, she has her daughter working along beside. The staff are all pleasant and obviously enjoy working there.  The patrons are a friendly and gather for happy hour. Very comfortable bar."
50,The Ben--Zaa Hotel and Restaurant is a long term family run establishment that supports a local family. The rooms are simple and clean and the roof top is perfect for sunsets -  so ask Maria to make you a special Margarita and head up. You are close to the downtown strip plus near the best small beach. Steve is a very good chef and makes delicious home-style meals with plenty of food. The price is economical and has great energy !
50,Without a doubt the 6 ounce tequila field margaritas are the best in town. Go for happy hour and stay for the visits in the atmosphere where everyone is friendly. The food looks very good but unless you pre-order when you get there you will be disappointed as only a certain amount of meals are made each dinner. 
50,"After traveling far and wide, I can attest to the fact that the best Margaritas anywhere I have been are made here, by Maria!  And the Pina Coladas are awesome as well!  Happy hours are two-for-one but take the good advice given by the locals and limit yourself to one two-for-one.  This is a popular, well-known spot for happy hours and is open every day, in season, but Sunday.  The kitchen also serves tasty food prepared by Steve.  Along with the regular menu, a special is offered daily.  Check out the lasagna and the delicious cabbage rolls.  "
40,"The hotel Nayar it's located on 407 Perez Gasca Av. It's a nice place near to the principal  beach and very near to the Adoquin that is a place with a lot of stores where you can buy clothes, hats and souvenirs you can take tour's  to see turtles, manta rays, dolphins. There are some restaurants bar too; the rooms are clean with air con the people who works there are real nice and polite the food at the restaurant of the hotel "" La Terraza "" is real good with good prices, the pool area is great too and there's a parking lot so you can parking your car if you need it for free without any problem there's wifi for free too so it's a nice place to spend great time "
40,"We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Santa Fe.  The rooms are spacious. The AC was quite welcome. Unfortunately, most beds in Mexico seem to be double size beds, which we find quite confining (we are used to a California King). But the restaurant was good there and enjoys a fantastic view of the ocean.  It is right across a low volume street from the beach.  The hotel provides large towels for use at the pool. One pool for adults and one for families. Hot water was plentiful too, making for a nice shower. We did not always have access to hot water at our hotels in Mexico. "
50,"we have been here numerous times on out annual trip to puerto escondido.  we've had lunches and dinners and we have never been disappointed.  the salads, enchiladas, fish dishes are all excellent.  the menu is very extensive.  the restaurant is part of a huge old hotel and it is on the second floor overlooking the beach and always a good sunset.  if you come puerto escondido be sure to try this place"
50,"We stayed in a Jr. Suite which was huge and had a lovely view.  But I would consider a smaller room next time because the deck and restaurant were so comfortable and had such splendid views, that we didn't really need the room view.  It was hard to go elsewhere to eat because it was so relaxed and beautiful at this restaurant.  We also loved that it was just steps to the beach, which is long and great for walking and watching the surfers.  (Note, this beach is considered dangerous for swimming.)"
50,"We are staying for 10 days and opted for a Junior Suite. More money than we usually spend for hotels in Mexico, but this has been worth every penny. The location is lovely, being at a quiet end of the beach. The room we have is very comfortable and the terrace overlooking the pool, with the sea in the background, is like a movie set. The staff, and I mean everyone, has been courteous, efficient, and just nice. The restaurant is not overpriced and is actually a good place for any meal, although there are lots of options nearby. The two pools are well maintained, clean, refreshing, and we'll supplied with chairs, tables, and lounge chairs. Poolside service with a smile.   Again, there are cheaper places along this stretch of beach. We've looked at a lot of them and this is, by"
40,"A lovely older hotel on the beach, location location location right on Zicatela Beach. You can watch surfers, whales jumping and skydivers, all while enjoying a cocktail on the balcony beside the pool overlooking the beach. It is showing its' age, but still very comfortable and clean. Wonderful staff in every area, could provide a bit more bar service on the balcony, but when they came, very polite and helpful. Wonderful on site restaurant that I will review separately, but it also is excellent!"
40,"Hotel Sante Fe is a beautiful, if somehwat dated, hotel at the northern edge of Playa Zicatela.  The location is great for exploring Zicatela and is a fairly short walk from Centro.  My room was large with a fairly comfortable queen size bed, central AC and a ceiling fan.  Bathroom was also large and shower had plenty of hot water.  The biggest drawback was the spotty Wi-Fi connection in my room, despite the fact that I was right across from the hotel office.  There were also a lot of kids at the hotel during my stay and they were a bit loud at times, though mostly during the day at the pool.  Aside from the internet issues, I would recommend Hotel Sante Fe to other visitors."
50,"Hotel Santa Fe is beautiful and comfortable, unpretentious and simply elegant, and located across the street from a lovely beach. It has two very nice pools. Our room (18) was big enough for 2 adults and 2 children, with all the amenities one needs. The entire property is Spanish colonial, with painted tile and terra cotta. The restaurant is simple and good. We really loved it there, and recommend it without hesitation."
50,"My family stayed at this fantastic hotel for eight marvelous days over the Thanksgiving holiday. What a hidden gem! Gorgeous Mediterranean design, lush gardens, spacious and airy rooms, and warm and helpful staff make this the best hotel in Puerto Escondido. Best of all, the restaurant serves fabulous food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I ate most of my meals there for eight days and loved everything I had. The pools are clean and well maintained and they set you up for terrific activities— bioluminescence and bird watching in a nearby lagoon, deep sea fishing for sailfish and marlin, steam bath and massage at a great spa, even releasing just hatched baby sea turtles to the sea. Going to Puerto Escondido takes a bit more effort that other well trafficked Mexican towns, but if"
40,"We enjoyed our stay in Puerto Escondido, the Hotel Santa Fe our home base there. The rooms are large. The bathroom and shower area allow a sandy someone in from the beach to comfortably clean-up The restaurant is top notch vegetarian waiters and waitresses friendly and helpful. The hotel staff may not have been as welcoming as other places we have visited.  The air conditioner was loud, there was a light behind the hotel that shown in our room despite the curtains being pulled. The hot water faucet did not work and was not repaired when the problem was pointed out to staff. The Hotel Santa Fe is top notch however could have done more in the way of being welcoming. "
50,"This lovely hotel is located across the street from a magnificent beach. The rooms are large and comfortable, decorated with antique-inspired furniture. The pool is refreshing. The restaurant overlooks the beach."
50,"Everyone at Hotel Mayflower, especially Hector (an owner), made me feel very welcomed during my week-long stay. Hector took at least an hour of his time to help me successfully connect with my phone service provider! He talks with his guests and even receives hugs from some return guests. The staff provides service in Spanish and English. The location of Hotel Mayflower is central to many of the vendors, restaurants and beaches."
50,The staff are so friendly and helpful. They can speak English and can give you helpful information about the area. It's both a hostel and a hotel. I stayed in the hostel. It's clean and tidy and with decent beds and bathrooms. Good kitchen and common areas. The breakfast is nice too.
40,"my 4th stay at mayflower.   once again, i planned a weeks stay, and ended up staying 6 weeks.   very good location; near beach, fishermans landing, supermarket, town, zicatela, rinconada.  can be noisy at night, especially on weekends.   new owners hector and mariana will go way out to help you.   the kitchen is large, fun and well-equipped with pots pans dishes and fridge; you get to meet people from all over the world. with a few exceptions, i found the guests at the mayflower to be very interesting people. PUERTO IS AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO CHILL AFTER DOING SOME HIGHLANDS TRAVELLING.  THERE'S JUST ENOUGH TO DO TO KEEP YOU STIMULATED, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO GET YOU STRESSED.  the afternoon/evening bird/boat trip to manialtepec with bioluminescence (pick a moonless night) highly"
50,"I really enjoyed this hotel.   price was fine, breakfast included (at a very pleasant nearby restaurant in front of beach).  free coffee all day.  room was large and airy with good wifi, ceiling fan and terrace overlooking the ocean. there are also hostel style rooms, rooms with shared bath, and no breakfast rooms if desired.   nice mix of guests; young, older, foreign and mexican.   there is a huge full kitchen w/fridge, and a supermarket close by.  kitchen has a large dining table; good place to socialize. there is a billiards room.   many restaurants within 3 minutes walk.  overall location excellent- you can walk to the beach in 3 minutes, to town (5 minutes walk) or to playa carizallilo (18 minutes walk), zicatela (15 min walk).  Staff spoke excellent english, were always"
30,"We stayed at the hostel part, so I don't know about the hotel part.  The hostel is nothing special. It's run more like a hotel when it comes to socializing and the staff interaction with the guests.  It's clean, pretty quiet and it has a pooltable. Even though it's not in its prime. There's a kitchen, but it's not very well equipped. It's like a standard hostel kitchen."
50,"Hotel Mayflower is a great place to stay in Puerto Escondido!! Right by the beach, perfect facilities in the hotel/hostel,clean but most of all hector & Marianna do their best on making your stay as perfect as it could be and they did!! They are so helpful & welcoming! Look forward to returning to Puerto Escondido and Hotel mayflower!! "
50,"This hostal is clean, comfortable and in a great location. Hector and Mariana are so welcoming and go above and beyond to make your stay the best. The rooms and facilities are clean and spaciuos, the pool table and deck is great, and the balcony at the front of the hotel is great for sipping Coronas and watching the sunset. You are also super close to the beach and restaurants. Also book your tours via Hector or Mariana. They ensure correct pricing and you wont get mucked around by going through them. We loved our stay here and would definitely stay here again!"
50,"Now under new ownership, the Mayflower Hotel and Hostel is an oasis of warmth , ambience, and hospitality.  Hector and Marianna, the new owners, are welcoming and attentive to any need or request you may have as a guest.  The view is spectacular, and rooms large and impeccably clean,  old Mexican charm with all the modern amenities.  As a seasoned traveler,  I would ernestly recommend this establishment to anyonelooking for Bang for their Buck.."
50,"Excellent service!veryclean rooms&bathrooms,Lg equipped kitchen,steps from beach &shops,2 blocks from bus station&grocery store, pooltable,piano,oceanview terrace,for $2 more u get full breakfast onthe beach"
50,"The owners changed one week ago (8/16).  We had great time and great price! The couple who own the place were amazing! Decently cheap and worth every peso. Close to the beach, cheap, great atmosphere. What else do you need?  "
40,"We booked a suite at the ground level, a very large and good room with kitchen. Service was very good and everything was clean and new.  Breakfast was included, and very good. Restaurants and other bars are just outside the entrance, perfect location!  The bad part was all the noisy neighbours. There was a party all night in the room next to us, and outside people were loud at the pool after pool hours."
50,"Stayed at the Rockaway for 3 nights when my sister and her husband came to just us in PE.  We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms and a shared living room and kitchen.  I absolutely love the use of natural materials - the kitchen counter was a huge slab of wood and the use of stones and granite in the bathrooms.  Our room overlooked the pools (2 figure 8 shaped pools) and Zicatela beach.  The hotel has the BEST gym in town which is air-conditioned.  So if having a gym is important to you - this is the place!  The gym also offers yoga, pilates, and other fitness classes everyday!  The breakfast buffet is just terrific and was included in the price of room.  It has fresh juices, pancakes, usually 2 different kinds of eggs, mexican fare (chilaquiles), bacon or other kind"
50,"Blown away!   I stayed here a few years back and had a great time at the old Hotel Rockaway. Now let me say, this place totally blew me away.  It's been renovated from top to bottom.  The rooms were gorgeous and the staff blew me away with how helpful they were. I liked hanging out in the courtyard beside the fountains - after coming back from Zicatela beach - where we did some amazing surfing.  This hotel was hands down the nicest, best located & newest property on the entire strip."
50,This Rockaway Hotel is like something out of a Jimmy Buffett song! Everyone at the hotel has a big smile and is very helpful and the rooms are amazing. I would highly recommend staying here. The atmosphere has a totally tropical vibe from the pools to the cafe and bar area. The location is smack in the center of the best beach in all of Mexico and the best thing is that its almost undiscovered so you enjoy an affordable tropical paradise that you will never forget.
50,"AWESOME; My first time in Puerto Escondido for working purposes. My guests booked me a room here and I was more than pleased. Excellent location, great rooms -I had a single one but got a peek at several other options and truly I am going back to take my December vacations there -already booked!!!! Excellent pool -if you just want to float around and enjoy a drink. All staff more than ready to help you out in anything you may need.  What let me down a bit was the restaurant -my stay included a breakfast buffet from which the only thing I enjoyed were the hotcakes, fruit and cereal.  From there, everything else is just AWESOME."
30,"This new HOTEL ROCKAWAY has good lookin photos of the pool area & palapas, The are the photos od the OLD > HOTEL ROCKAWAY, that got demolished, to build the new existing one.  Photos should be removed, they imply that there is a pool/palapa bar, with ocean view. It's not there. The new pool is like a small tub in comparrison.  I did look walk thru the hotel last winter & it looked pretty classy. Thought I was in the states. Never stayed there."
40,"My sister and I stayed at Rockaway for three nights during our visit to Puerto. We thought it was great. The location doesn't get any better - situated right on Zicatela Beach, in close proximity to restaurants, bars and, of course, the beach. It is also super easy to grab a taxi straight out the front of the hotel and head to the near by attractions. Facilities are great - especially the gym which we used every day. There is even a fro-yo place in the same complex! (I was in heaven) The staff are awesome and all go out of their way to help you in what ever way possible. My sister went down stairs to borrow some wine glasses and returned with a member of staff, holding the glasses an ice bucket, a stand and a cork screw (he insisted on opening it for us).  Given that it is a new"
30,"Renovated only six months before our visit, the hotel looks great. The rooms are spacious, clean, and modern. The staff are super nice and helpful. Pool is small but fun.   On the other hand, there are a few downsides. Proximity to beach clubs means very noisy nights. The club kept the house music going till 4am. The administration needs a little maturing. Security box had run out of batteries and they needed to turn on our hot water, which never really got hot.   With a few more months of learning, this hotel could really take off. "
50,"My wife and I have stayed in 7 different hotels in Puerto Escondido, and we both agree that our stay at the Rockaway was definitely the best (and it wasn't even close).  The whole property is incredible. Lots of neat attention to detail.   Our room was very comfortable and had a beautiful view of the pool area.  The location can't be beat. Its right on Zicatela beach and very close to many different restaurants.  The complimentary buffet breakfast was also incredible.   The best part of our stay at the Rockaway was the staff.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.  There is a true commitment to customer service that we have not experienced anywhere else in Puerto. We were only there for a short stay, but the staff made us feel like family.    This is the hotel I will be"
50,"Hotel Rockaway underwent major renovations, and it shows! The architectural details and attention to detail makes it the best hotel in Puerto Escondido! Located right in the heart of Zicatela Beach and directly across the street from the beach, Hotel Rockaway is ideally located; every November, surfers from across the globe come to Puerto Escondido to compete in surfing competitions.   When we arrived at the hotel, we were astounded by the stunning views and were warmly greeted by reception. The courtyard has fountains that are lit at night which is surrounded by shops. At every turn, there is interesting details and impressive stonework. Our suite had two bedrooms both with king size beds, a modern kitchen with seating for 3 at the kitchen island and a seating area. The master"
50,"Just off the main road of Puerto and only a 15min walk from three of the main beaches of the area, Casa Losodeli offers a nice pool, huge grounds and very clean rooms. The rooms are very cheap for their quality and the staff are super hospitable."
40,"Only ''slept'' there one night, but felt like home, so even if I had to move hostel, was coming back to chill with friends and owners!  One word to describe the place : CHILL.  The life just stop and slowdown there.  Beach in front, only sand to walk on, hammock to sleep in, few good restaurants to get to from the main/street entrance.  You will meet people from all around the world, and from the moment you walk in, you will just feel you know them already.  Deeply recommending and need to advise you, your short stay will transform to a longer one!  Thank you to everyone working there, and hope to see you around!  Valery from MTL."
20,"The staff were somewhat helpful and friendly, but there is some tension. The room was hot and the low bunks, lower has no room felt claustrphobic. Especially with the heat.  Toilets far from the room and although cute, the paving stones are far enough apart that I almost fell a few times,.."
50,"I haven't stay there but I was there to visit a friend. They let me in, even I joined the free salsa class which is fun and drink in the bar (my own drink). They are really friendly. There is a good vibe."
50,"Fantastic Wifi, inviting pool, incredible staff, comfortable rooms, very clean, decent location, great value, and an overall fun time.  Really enjoyed my time in Losodeli, so much in fact that i spent about a week longer than i initially intended!"
40,This place is perfect if you want to take your time and chill in the pool/bar. Offering a kitchen and pretty cheap drinks (only 3 different drinks tho). Close to Carizalillo beach  which is good for begginners. The pool is great and warm enough to enter after dark. Only 'downside' is that they enforce silence after 11:00 at night. Making it difficult to party.
50,"Lovely hostel in a great setting. The beautiful pool area is a highlight. Great location for local beaches. The two double rooms we stayed in were very spacious, cool in the hot weather and cheap. The cleaning lady came daily and was very thorough. Not the most sociable hostel for solo travellers, but as a couple with friends staying we found it perfect."
50,This place....oh yes. So clean. Tidy and friendly. Great clean pool and really good atmosphere. I had an absolutely brilliant time here and ended up staying much longer than expected. The rooms were hot ish at times but deal with it. It's worth it! The staff are brilliant. I'd stay here again! 
50,"This hostel is incredible.   I don't think I've ever stayed in a hostel that has made me feel as welcome as I did here. Liz and the other staff members are so incredibly helpful. Liz in particular helped me to organise Spanish, dance and surf lessons (most of which came with a discount just for going through Liz) yet expected nothing in return.   She also recommended the best things to do within Puerto and, when she could, got us all in her car to take us directly to where we wanted to be.   As for the hostel itself, it's great. It's clean (seriously clean, everyday there are two to three staff members tending to the pool, the common areas and rooms), in a great location and very well maintained.   I may be slightly biased as I had an apartment within the hostel, but every other"
30,"I was told this was an amazing hostel but I consider they have many things to improve. The rooms are a bit old and need maintenance, there are messy and noisy people at night so don't expect to sleep very much, there were also many misunderstandings at the reception and someone did get into my room in the middle of the night...  But the staff is nice (thanks Maryam for helping me!), everything is clean and you can find the nicest beaches nearby."
50,"I felt really welcome, the receptionist Lizeth was very helpful when I was sick, all receptionists are friendly, rooms are clean, swimming pool is nice, nice athmosphere. muy bien, superhostel, good good good, highly recommended."
30,"Excellent location at beachfront, in the heart of Punta Zicatela, guarded at night.  Good vibes, mostly backpackers between 18 to 50 sharing beer and pot in the jungle gatden between tents, hammocks, bungalows and dorms. Staff mostly friendly and chatty.   Poor attention on basics: kitchen opens not until 8am (If you want to have a brekkie before catching the morning waves), communal areas and the few facilities often dirty, lightning in cabanas and dorms very poor and dark, no lockers, unfortunately thieves, bad/no WIFI (as in entire Punta Zicatela), whole interior has come a little bit over the years and could be renewed / cleaned e.g. mattresses, kitchen amenities...  Overall: value for money is ok if you don't mind a bit of easy-going and laissez-faire hippie-attitude and"
40,"The hostel has an ideal location if you want to surf la punta every morning; you can check the waves from the front of the hostel, many options to eat nearby. Rooms are very basic and only one fan working makes it little to warm with a share dorm but in general is good for the price... bathrooms and showers are clean! kitchen area could take a bit of a refreshment but everything works and is handy. Pete the owner is a great guy. Pura Vida"
40,"Is one of the best hostels i ve ever been. I met people amazing in this place. You will be in front of the beach for a cheap price, they try to be the most consciense with the enviroment. The only bad thing is there are some rats(thief)  and steal your stuff in the night, so be carefull"
40,"Being there for 2 weeks in Dec 2017, I'm amazed but still there are some things that can be improved.  So, CONS and PROS - please get to the PROS part  CONS:  - The main one is not having enough if bathrooms/showers. 2x6-bed dorms share 1 combined shower. You can adapt your needs, but not always. Same goes for the private cabanas and camping - 9 cabanas and easily 30 tents share only 2 showers and 2 WCs - separated. Not enough.  - kitchen - one kitchen for that amount of guests is almost not sufficient, especially with the size of the fridge which is a single one, Recommendation is to get a second one and to adapt the kitchen wisely for more guests. Anyway, if u're willing to cook, you can do it.   - WIFI connection - even while being on the beach, you need to stay in touch."
50,"Beautiful hostel, really really chill. Right on the beach , no floor only sand . Don’t expect to much from the rooms just basic beds not too clean.  The common area is plain beautiful , so relaxing .  I loved the stay here!"
50,"Camping, dorms and cabanas on the beach.  Ocean lovers will go crazy at the pelican feeding frenzy in the mornings.  It's a crowded surf spot, so get out there early.  Great for solo travellers, always lots of people around."
50,"We ended up staying longer than expected! Beautiful little cabanas on the beach with a shared kitchen and bathroom. The owners are amazing and know everyone in their hostel (even your name) because they actually care about who comes to their hostel.  Great location near restaurants and stores as well as the surfspots. La punta is a 5min walk and Zicatella about 15-20min. We traveled for a year in 14 countries, we can count the best hostels on one hand and this one is part of it. Great atmosphere!   "
50,Owners hang around they are pretty helpfull   staff is locals as far as I could see  don't know if some volunteers work here but again owners rule  I did some camping but the dorms are cool too  the kitchen is neat  the sell beers  and they have a chilled vibe like 5 minute walk to the point if you want to surf  and ten to the famous Puerto Escondido huge barrels  location is aweosme and people too  cheers and thanks
30,"stayed in the dorm there for a night with friend. guy at the reception was friendly and helpful. 6bed dorm cost 120mx but you can sleep cheer if you decide to stay in a hammock. beds in the dorm have seen better days. also in a place like this the fans they had seemed not to be sufficient. i was sleeping right next to one but behind the mosquito net it felt pretty useless. ventilation was missing as well, during the night it got so hot could make it anymore and i m quite used to something."
30,"The pluses are the swimming pool and the gardens. It also has pretty good Wi-Fi for Puerto Escondido, where the Wi-Fi notoriously bad. I was however extremely irritated that some of my clothes went missing as part of the in house laundry service.  The staff generally mean well, but things run a bit slow. Phillipe the owner, neither speaks Spanish or English. You need to wait until Luis arrives about noon to have a coherent answer to a query that you may have."
50,"I spent on and off about 10 days in this beautiful hotel and it was like arriving in paradise to my family. Luis and Philipe made my stay absolutely amazing. I met wonderful people at this beautiful hotel. Imagine a garden full of plants, swimming pool, hammock. I would recommend this place to couples, solo travellers, families, friends! The rooms are beautiful and spacious. The only downside is that there is no food but some rooms come with a kitchen and it's about 200m from restaurants. I will come back!"
50,"The grounds are peaceful and lush with a large pool, hammocks, gorgeous tropical plants, butterflies and humming birds... Bernadette & Philippe, the hosts, are extremely caring and charming. The bedrooms are decorated with upmost taste in mexican style with a mixture of vivid colours and wood. A 5 minute walk from a plethora of restaurant and 8 mns from the beach. We found paradise and recommend it as the best place to stay in Puerto Escondido :)"
50,"This hacienda  is fabulous .We want  This review to reflect how gorgeous  the gardens, pool and comfort and spacious  suites. King bed, 4 poster, living space , full kitchen,  very secure as the property  is gated. Luis greeted us and was thorough  in giving  us ⁰ All necessary  information.  20 min walk to playa. Restaurants nearby We will return"
50,"This place is incredible! Great location to walk to the beach and restaurants. The hotel is extremely clean, well furnished, and comfortable. Very quiet and relaxing. I would highly recommend for a couple or anyone looking to find rest."
50,"My husband and I found this hotel through TripAdvisor and, as usual, we were not disappointed. Hotel has all you need: super nice and comfortable rooms, big and clean swimming pool, super nice staff and the beach is very close. You can find nice little restaurants to eat very close to the hotel too. Very relaxing. Highly recommended :) "
50,We came here for a coffee and loved it so much. Bernadette the owner and creator of the hotel is a wonderful host. The gardens are amazing and the place is beautiful with a fantastic swimming pool. The coffee was delicious. It is very close to main street with all the restaurants and beach. 
50,We were so lucky to find this Oasis Paradise !!! Excellent location Beautiful Grounds!!! The best Mix of French and Mexican Touch !!! Superb bedrooms suites  and decoration to the best Decor !!! Swimming Pool coconut trees at least 100 plants all around different flowers colours leaves .. was just peaceful to be sitting around the pool or under the umbrellas or just enjoying the hamacas under the coconut trees. Will remember this beautiful oasis and the kindness of all their members making possible to us to have a great memories of our vacations and want to come back now for a longer period next year.  Congratulations. Special thanks to Phillip and Madam.  😉👌💃🏻❤️🙏.   Dave and Olga  🇨🇦
50,"Just great.  Spacious rooms, A/C (extra charge $6/day, worth it!)  Meticulously maintained, lush, peaceful gardens surround the pool.  Great helpful staff. Our room, the basic, was $65.  Four poster bed, tiled bathroom, immaculate. Sweet owner.  Please patronize this hotel - it is a gem!"
50,Very well maintained little boutique hotel.  Highly recommend it to anyone.  I found the staff to be very helpful and the hotel is very clean and well maintained.  Would highly recommend it to anyone.  Lovely French charm
40,"How wonderful to find such a lovely new restaurant so close to home.  Osa Thyme may very well become one of our favorites.  Although the food selection was small, everything we had was amazingly creative and delicious, and the service was wonderful, which is surprising for such a new restaurant.  I am sure we will be seeing much more of Osa Thyme.  ❤️"
40,"The cottages are very basic but clean. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.  Common area is a pleasant place to lay hang in hammock and wait through the midday heat. Location is ok, close to the beach, around 1,5km from both Punta Zicatela to the south and Playa Zicatela to the north. Great vegan/vegetarian food is served, affordable and healthy breakfasts plus a family dinner (not every day) in the evening. Friendly cats (especially the black one)."
50,"While visiting PE, we ate at the Osa Mariposa twice. There was one vegetarian, one vegan and 5 omnivores among our group.  No matter our preferred diet, we all loved the food and drink here!  Big hearty helpings of fresh foods at great prices; what more can you want?  While our Spanish is less than stellar, the servers were kind and tolerated our poor Spanish, and it was easy to order from the menus as they were in both Spanish and English.  I had breakfast tacos one day, and pancakes another. Both were just awesome.  Definitely try the hisbiscus tea- I would not have thought to try it myself, but we ended up ordering a pitcher it was so good! I had a different smoothie each time that was equally awesome. (Gotta stay hydrated in PE)!  The second day we stayed longer and had a"
50,"We rented a three bedroom cottage, the hostel is located close to the beach with a very beachy and great atmosphere.   We really enjoyed staying there, the breakfast was amazing (try to hot cakes) and we also ate the vegetarian dinner during night which was amazing.   The place is super chill and you feel like home right away!"
50,"Chill little hotelito with small bungalows available. Food is really good, and is what attracted us to the place. A good alternative to the local Mexican food, which sometimes isn't cooked with the most healthy ingredients (i.e. manteca) :)   Beach is closeby, but not so safe for swimming, but perfect for surfing as La Punta is closeby, which is one of the best breaks in the area. Other spots are closeby. Call a taxi to the hotelito anytime to get driven anywhere in town.   Mosquitos exist here, but also everywhere else. Beds have nets. WiFi is decent and the shaded communal area is nice to relax in after surfing or walking the beach."
20,"This place is great if you are a stoner surfer, but that's about it.   Yes, it's hot and there are tons of bugs, but that's to be expected within the price range and location. The food is good and the common space is cute.   My problem lies in the service. I found most of the staff unhelpful and cold. When I first got there to check in I was barely greeted, rather just looked at. I had to ask all the questions that usually someone at the front desk will tell you.. E.g towels, beach location, tours, breakfast, dinner etc. Whenever I did ask the questions I got a cold terse response. I asked about the busses to Oaxaca and how to book them and they didn't know. The temporary workers who clean the facilities  who are there from abroad for a month at a time or so were way more"
50,"I booked 4 nights and in the end I spent over two weeks at Osa Mariposa. I enjoyed every single second there! The staff is super nice, the food is AMAZING and the peaceful vibe with the garden, hammocks and cats is just perfect to relax! "
50,"Puerto Escondido is a must do for everyone. For the chiller, surfer, soul searcher it is a second home. The place is full of relaxed people spreading super chilled vibes. I was only there for a weekend for a break from the city, but I am definitely going to return. La Punta is full of wicked fun little hostels and Zicatela has your night life needs. The beach is absolutely beautiful and hosts some world class surf breaks. I stayed in Osa Mariposa Hostel and loved it. I would not describe this is a party hostel, more of a super relaxing, charming hideaway, recommended for the low budget traveler. It was perfect for our stay, we wanted a relaxing weekend with sand and surf and Osa Mariposa gave us a little retreat, surrounded by nature and serving vegetarian/vegan meals and"
50,"Really enjoyed our stay, the room was small, but nice. Staff very helpfull and the ambience nice. Dinners are made by heart and a great way to meet people. The localization is a bit tricky, as its far from the center of playa zicatela and a 20 minutes walk from punta zicatela. "
50,This is late in but none the less. Stayed here in july last year. Stayed for a week. Goldie was a great bloke. Good laugh and all round legend. Il be back to Puerto and staying here the whole time. The food is unreal even if ya not vegan or vegetarian. The beers are cold the beach is just there the place is clean and if you dont like it you suck
50,"A comfortable room, good air conditioning (thank God, it was so hot...)immaculate grounds, large pool and ocean views. Restaurant with good meals and attentive staff. Very good Wifi, good showers with plenty of hot water. All for $55 USD..."
40,"We used this hotel following an 8-day epic cycling trip across Mexico.  After 7 nights rough camping, this was a dream hotel for our finish.  The rooms are spacious and clean and we thankfully had a room with an ocean view.  For a 2-day stay the hotel was ideal - the pool is lovely, the hotel was quiet (we were there end November) and what meals we had in the hotel were good.  A short taxi ride takes you into town when you can then wander the shops at your leisure.  However, when compared to other hotels around the world, it is basic.  The double beds are small and with 2 beds in the room, we took 1 bed each rather than squeeze into a small double.  The air conditioning was very noisy and took an age to get working.  Windows are not the most secure, and useless at shutting out"
40,"The Mexican Pipeline means the best surf in all of Mexico and this is possibly the best hotel in all the area. I have to say compared to the other ""top"" hotels this appears to be the best. Raquel Orozco who works at the front desk went out of her way to make sure I was well, as did Moises, and Daniel who serves in the restaurant. I highly recommend one of the very well priced spa treatments by David. Be sure to ask (repeatedly if you have to) for an ocean view room. Yes they fill up but if you check back daily they will switch you when one becomes available. It is easy for this boutique sized hotel to be full but you will always be treated well as you can't just come and go without being forced to pass through the reception area and be seen. Best of all, included for free is"
50,"i found this hotel on trip advisor and was like totally drawn to it by its look i managed to get a decent price online for it and was totally like a little kid as soon as I walked into the lobby..it has a very simple but yet calm look bout it and the white building is absolutely stunning..i love my room ..its simple but yet comfortable and clean..i feel like i checked into turkey or instanbul not that i have been there..so i basically spent 2 mins in my room, threw on my swimmers and went straight to the pool..it was amazing..i had to totally look around at it a few times as its pretty pleasing to the eye..the weather was absolutely perfect for swimming and sunbathing so that is what i did ..i ordered lunch from the inhouse restaurant and that was delicious ..i am vegetarian so"
40,"I stayed two nights here on a tour. The hotel is great! Really cool Spanish architecture. The hotel has a huge pool and a childrens pool. It's located away from the main township of Puerto but it's Mexico, only costs about 50 pesos to get there in a taxi anyway. There is an open air restaurant and the barman does pool service!   Best thing about the rooms was their size... They're huge! The bathroom looked like it had been renovated as it was newer then the rooms. The rooms themselves aren't amazing but they're clean, tiday and have air con. My room had two queen beds. You could easily fit a whole family in one room.  The staff were really good. One of the girls on the tour lost her key for the safety deposit box (All at reception) and we were leaving the next day. They had"
30,"I went and stayed in this hotel a couple of years ago. I had lived in Mexico for 3  1/2 years , and this was my first return. I had stayed in other hotels in Puerto Escondido in the past, but my favourite hotel was booked, so we checked in here.  It was easter time, and hot. So hot that we needed the air conditioning. Which was fine, except it got REALLY cold . Around 3am I was awakened by something cold and hard hitting me. The a/c had cooled so much that it had frozen , and small icicles, rather like hail, were raining down on me from the a/c!  The hotel itself was fine. I love the untouchedness of Puerto Escondido, and I wasn't disappointed in the hotel. It's not the finest in Mexico, but it's clean and good value for money, and the spa treatments make you think you are back"
20,"Even a fantastic, helpful and hard working staff (Yuri, Dulce, Gina and more) could not compensate for the sorry state of Cabana #2.    A dingy, musty, dark relic of the 80’s (though it feels like the 60’s) which has not be upgraded since.   Toilet clogged at first use, and was kindly left a hand pump for recurring episodes. Bathroom faucet has only cold water and outdoor shower only hot (not to mention all the electric cables wrapped around the shower head).  Cracked glass pane contributed to feeling of neglect, not to mention the holes on the reed panel on the back door which was ‘mosquitoes highway’ along other points of entry through the thinning palms of the thatched roof.  Narrow spiral staircase goes up into the furnace otherwise known as the bedroom with two fans that"
50,"I stayed at Casa de Dan for the last two weeks of June this year.  What a beautiful place, so clean, with lovely gardens and conveniently located.  I would have liked to come back the next year, but it is all booked up.  I can see why!"
50,"Excellent hospitality, large place for a family of 4 - large unit and palapa. Nice pool to relax in after a hot day at beach or in town. Bonus that a cafe is attached for breakfast or lunch - great food and super reasonable. Wifi was spotty, but that is expected in Mexico at times, we just worked with it.  Not all places have AC so make sure to verify since some people have a harder time adjusting to the heat. Easy walk to lots of places and short cab ride to most other attractions or beaches! Highly recommend!!"
50,"I recently returned from a trip to Puerto Escondido with friends. We stay at Dan’s almost every time we are in town, and always if there is vacancy. The location is awesome, the accommodations are fantastic, the atmosphere is inviting, and the staff is absolutely fantastic! This time around, I dislocated my shoulder surfing the beach break out front. I was taken to Dan’s by the very helpful lifeguards at Zicatela. Dan and staff were very attentive, reassured me that everything would be ok, and worked together to set up an immediate appointment with an orthopedic surgeon in town. Yuri, one of Dan’s employees working the front desk, personally drove me to the surgeon where she acted as my translator/caretaker through the entire process. I could not be more grateful for her and Dan"
50,"We stay there for a couple of months every year.  Dan and the staff always make us feel like we are coming back to our second home.  The gardens and pool area are beautiful, a tranquil place to relax and hang out in.  I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Puerto Escondido."
50,"We were lucky to stay here for two nights on our last trip to Puerto. The staff was friendly and the accommodations spacious and comfortable. We enjoyed our two bedroom suite with kitchen, as well as our own HUGE private palapa. I could not get over our awesome terrace! The pool is a true lap pool, and we met some fellow travelers while hanging out there. The gardens are lush and the bougainvillea were in full bloom. I appreciated the extra security of the locked gate in the evening. The food and service at the restaurant were also really, really good. Dan is friendly and a great host as well.  I hope to return!"
50,"Having traveled pretty extensively throughout Mexico, we can state with confidence that Casa Dan's is an incredible value and just about perfect. Dan and his staff are fantastic. A great hacienda feel. A real lap pool. The restaurant is superb.  Coming back for a month next year. "
50,"We recently stayed for 2 weeks at Casa de Dan, and I now understand why it is difficult to get accommodation here. There are many returning customers who appreciate the location (just up from Playa Zicatela), the excellent services from the cleaning staff, the food available at the attached Dan's Deluxe Cafe, and the well-appointed sizeable suites. With all that said, the greatest attraction for this Casa is the pool, which is long enough for laps but is also the main meeting place for the various guests. The only downside to Casa Dan's is the weak Internet service that is available. It is strong enough for texting and E-mails, however if you MUST have Netflix or Skype, then you made be disappointed. I suggest that you forget about these services, and kick back and just enjoy a"
50,"Casa Dan is run by Dan, who else. This is a delightful place walking distance to the Zicatela surfing beach. Dan's has nice, clean, comfortable rooms. Some have AC some do not. Some have a view, some do not, but all the rooms will make you happy. There is a lap pool and a great restaurant. I think I enjoyed the burgers and breakfasts there as much or more than at the 4 Star resort we stayed at."
50,"We stay for one night, nice views to the beach, great room and clean, with wifi. Service was very nice and helpful! close to the city center but quiet at the same time. Would definitely recommend it, great value for money!"
50,"I traveled with my two best friends and stayed for 10 days.  If you are traveling only with girls this is a good hostel to stay at, security is really good, there's a nice old guy who stays all night to make sure only guests come in.  The rooms are very clean and spacious, the hammock outside the rooms is so good to relax and read a good book.  There's also so many flowers inside the hostel.  The pool is small but it does its function quite well.  The location is perfect, you just have to walk across the street to get to the beach, everything is walking distance and they help you set up surfing lessons! The employees are super nice, our bus left at 8pm and the nice Italian owner let us stayed until we left at no charge! Next time we're in P.E. this is our stop for sure!!"
30,"Good people, clean, nice hotel decoration, good value for money ! Fan are sufficient. you can rent Surf !"
40,"Really good place to stay in Zicatela in front of the beach. The owners are really cool and good people. The place is simple, with the basic accomodations for you to surf your (--) off. Reading some comments before I went, some people mentioned about the room done at 2pm? who cares! it's a surf hostel, it's not resort. Cool to go with your girlfriend, if she is cool and doesn't worry about the perfect room. Rooms have a hammock outside each room, a private small bathroom, a bed, a little table to put your stuff, and a fan. that's it. Small rooms, could get really warm summer time. Nice atmosphere overall. Un abrazo Julian, gracias por todo. Ciao - Saludos Renato-Peru"
50,"This place if perfect.  I recommend walk-in reservation.  There are plenty of hotels and hostels on the beach so you can fall back in one of those, if PS doesn't have a room.  I paid 10USD/night.  It is right on the beach.  The rooms are clean.  You have the option of personal kitchen and AC, but who would pay extra for it.  It's Mexico at it's finest.  Be ready to negotiate a better price on the room, if not you may pay about $15-20USD/night.    other residences -women from all parts of the world (ratio men to women is 1:5) -surfers  Amenaties -towel -bar of soap -hammock -fan -bed -pool"
20,"The rooms were pretty poor, and not even that clean or well kept. The main problem was the number of complaints about when the room was booked. A lot of people were told that they had booked for the previous night and were made to pay an extra day. Make sure that youget e-mail confirmation about the dates in which you were staying otherwise the hotel will charge you for an extra day and because it is in high season there will be no option other than to pay as other hotels will be booked."
40,"I stayed at the Papaya Surf for three nights and they treated me like a family member. Anything you need, you'll get it there. The rooms are comfortable and clean, and being at the southern side of Playa Zicatela the prices are cheaper than average. The upstairs bar is cosy and laid back, and the restaurant up front serves a fantastic breakfast. Try it! "
10,"I check on the web about a Hotel in Puerto Escondido. I saw a few and Papaya surf looks like a clean Hotel with a friendly atmosphere. My advice: Don't go there, it is terrible, rooms are awful, the swimming pool is nothing but a pool of disease and the worst part is that they make do a deposit throw mail to save that crappy thing. Don’t go. "
50,We arrived after a long 12 hour bus journey and the receptionist Gabby was so lovely and welcoming and instantly put our travel stress at ease. Even went the extra mile to tell us on how best to get around and where to eat etc.
50,"Awesome hostel! Everything super clean and perfect organized. It's not direct at the beach but everything is easy to reach by cheap Colectivo. The volunteers are super motivated and plan a lot of cool stuff everyday. Thanks especially to Max, Vivi and Diego!! "
50,"I stayed in this charming hostel for 4 nights last September. The staff was lovely towards customers and they made us really good breakfast. I could talk a lot to a few volunteers working in the hostel. It is always nice to be able to talk that way and learn a lot from different people backgrounds.   To sum up : if you want to have fun, eat well, relax after an intense surfing day. This an excellent spot to stay in."
50,"This hostel has such a good vibe, I wanted to stay here for 4 nights initially and I left after 1 month... The location is downtown, which means that you're ín Mexican life. Cheap and good local food places around, the big market around the corner and just a 10 minute walk to the beach. I would really recommend staying here, the owners and staff are also super friendly and always in for a (good) party."
50,Stayed here for 4 nights. Met loads of people really easily. The bar is great at night for meeting people to out with and breakfast is the same for daytime activities. Everyone who works in reception is really helpful with advice on what to do. Look forward to visiting again.
50,"This is a great hostel for backpackers. It is close to the airport and also well placed within the town. The front desk is helpful and we used them to find laundry, a barbers, the beaches etc. They also organise trips/tours - although not enough people signed up for the one we wanted to do to make it feasible, but we were there in the off season.  Our dorm was bunk beds with an ensuite and lockers. The breakfast wasn't great but is included in the price.  Probably the biggest draw is the rooftop bar which has various themed nights and people from other hostels come here just for the bar. One of the best nights when we were there was a Salsa Night which ends up in a limbo contest before everyone goes off to a local bar for a night of drinking and dancing in the streets."
50,"We stayed here for 5 nights and it was the best experience, The manager Jess and all the staff are super helpful and make you feel right at home. All the guests hang out together at the big rooftop bar and chill Netflix lounge and put on awesome events such as the sunset feelings project (search or fb), salsa night ,surf lessons and fishing charters. The hostel itself is in a great location and has the best local food only seconds away. Would highly recommend staying here to anyone coming to Puerto Escondido."
50,My friend and I had a great time staying at Puerto Dreams. We met loads of fun people and the staff were very friendly and helpful with sorting out activities and giving recommendations. The rooms are reasonable and there is a fun bar on the top roof that gets lively most evenings. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to go to Puerto Escondido
50,Had such a comfortable stay here and the best part was the awesome surf lesson organised by the hostel. Angelo and Fabian were patient and very knowledgable teaching us all about safety in the water and the correct techinique - as we were completely new to surfing. They were also so fun to hang out with and it was one of my favourite activities in puerto!
50,"My friend and I stayed in a room with a private bathroom. Luckily with that reservation we were given unlimited use of the AC and had access to as many towels as we'd like! Breakfast was always delicious, the staff always helpful and the hostel itself was VERY clean. The front desk organized a trip for us to see the dolphins, turtles and whales, which was absolutely beautiful. the only complaint I personally have was that the music late at night definitely trailed on after midnight. But being a bit further from the bar helped, there is a room that is directly below the bar and the women who were booked in that room told us how hard it was to fall asleep, so we were spared! Would recommend this spot to anyone!"
50,This hotel is across the street from the beach. We moved here after a disastrous encounter at Dan Y Carmens place. Everyone here was friendly and helpful. The room was clean. The AC worked. The wi fi worked. The pools were pleasant - not crystal clear but adequate The staff even gave us a free ride to the airport when we left!
40,"one of the best places to stay in Puerto Escondido! surfer's best choice! just a few meters from the waves of Zicatela Beach, you just need to cross the street and surf. nice room view, clean and comfortable, friendly crew, very safe, nice swimming pool!!! good place to meet people as well. i do recommend!"
30,"Our Family decided to make stop in Puerto Escondido just by the end of Easter, arrived in Pto. Escondido around 11 p.m. and the staff was approachable and accommodate us in 3 rooms.  Rooms: were clean and A/C in working order, good value for money Pool: we were advised no to let the kids to get close to the water due to the strong chemicals to clean the pool overnight, water looked blurry  Restaurant: Clean and acceptable service  We noted the small sign above the front desk: Free Coffee and Toast and only took advantage of this in our last day, so coffee is what you get and 2 slices of toast, we were told kids are not included in the ""Free"" deal, which I found very antagonizing practice to the clientele specially when the staff proposed to charge $45.00 pesos for the 2 slices"
20,"This hotel is nicely located in a funky neighbourhood near a great surfing beach lined with good, inexpensive restaurants. The rooms were very basic, but clean.  That's the good news.  The bad news is:  the pool was NASTY, so dirty you couldn't see the bottom.  The day we left a young man was cleaning the scum ring with a cleaner so toxic he had to wear a scarf over his mouth and nose to avoid breathing in the fumes.  The cleaner was dripping into the water while he worked.  There was construction all around, with the necessary supplies piled in front of the ground floor rooms.  The ""breakfast"" that was included was 1 and 1/2 slices of toast and a cup of coffee. On principle we didn't eat there at all during our 4 day stay.  We wouldn't stay here again, as we do enjoy a swim in"
50,"Very helpful staff who speak English, cheap rates and clean, nice rooms. The pools are awesome and big and there is a restaurant with nice food at the front. Excellent location on zicatela beach. Highly recommended! "
40,"We stayed at Bungalows Zicatela last February  for the 2nd year in a row,  We stay for 13 -14 nites.  Bargained a great rate of 450 pesos @ night, with breakfast included.  Room was ocean view with air, 2 king beds, and refrigerator with a balcony for 2.   Great view of the sunsets.  Staff was very friendly.  There wsa construction of  6-8 2nd floor rooms so it was a little noisy during the day. Casa Babalon is nex door and it does get noisy 2 nites a weeek.   Located just across the road from the beach.  many great restaurants nearby.  The maid made sure our room ws SPOTTLESS every day when we returned from the beach. Never used the pools but they looked very clean.  Going back again this year for a long vacation. never did see a fitness center.  One plus was that they have a"
20,We stayed here for one night with the intention of staying for a few more but decided after one night not to leave. While the pool looked nice the room was dirty and the staff not very friendly. Wouldn't recommend this place.
40,"Beach: ""Playa Zicatela"" is definitely one of the best surfing spots/beaches on earth ... for advanced surfers! Don't (!) go there for swimming or if you're a surfing beginner, but choose e.g. ""La Punta"", if you surfed before and want to try a fast hollow point-break wave with left direction, sandy/rock bottom and normal length or ""Carrizalillo"", if you're a beginner and want a beach-break with left and right direction, sandy bottom and normal length.  Food: Breakfast is more of symbolic value than a treat, but there are a lot of tasty alternatives just a few steps from the hotel.  Location: Located on the road along ""Playa Zicatela"", which - road and beach - are busy, but not (too) noisy, all your daily needs are covered by the shops around the hotel, and if you'd like to"
30,We stayed during refurbishment of the hotel. There was noise from the builders in the day and the pool was dirty due to the dust and debris. Think charging 600pesos a night is abit much in the circumstances. The location is great and the room itself was lovely with a fantastic view of the ocean. When the refurb is complete it will be lovely but I'd wait until its finished
30,Decent place with generally helpful staff but roms have no screens on door or windows or the screen has holes and is poorly fitted. Tons of mosquitos! NExt door cafe has live music several times a week and it is impossible to sleep. Also have had group of tourists partying all night in the hotel pool; when asked staff to intervene(after 2 am)  they  smiled and did basically nothing. Internet exists but connection is very poor.  Not a place I'd like to visit again!
50,"Great hostel, really nice staff, good vibe and fun people of all ages. Bar is super cheap and everyone hangs out and has a family house kinda feeling. We were here for a week and really enjoyed just playing games and exploring the town. Hostel also has a great kitchen for cooking, including an oven! "
50,"This was one of the best hostels I have ever stayed at. Super helpful staff, super fun environment. Everyone was outgoing and fun. Never had a dull moment. I would highly highly recommend staying here if you want a clean cool place, have fun and make some awesome new friends. If there is any doubt in your mind about staying here, look no further this is going to be your home away from home during your stay in Escondido. Next time I'm in town I definitely planning on staying here, or will be back here for one of there awesome nights."
10,"This is quite possibly the most filthy hostel I have ever stayed at. There were random clothes hanging throughout. At least one shower stall had a decent sized collection of pubic hair growing in it. The outside upstairs areas were littered with cigarette butts and beer bottles. There were full ashtrays in multiple locations. The fans inside of the rooms had a layer of dust growing off of them. The floors were disgusting.    The Wifi barely worked, and I inquired about this. The response I received was something along the lines of “it’s bad all over Puerto Escondido”. This isn’t accurate, as I went to multiple coffee shops within walking distance, and had great Wifi at every single one.  The shower  water pressure was also very weak. Probably another thing that is bad all over"
50,"I've been traveling on and off for over 13 years and over 100 countries and rarely do I find such a beautiful balance of brilliance in a hostel. 13/10.   The place is stunning - beautiful old house, comfy beds , amazing owner and volunteers - they will give you all the advice and help you with whatever you need. You feel like family if you've been here for a day or a month - super inclusive place. Air con in the dorms are a god send - the bar is lively and still chill with cheap drinks.  Close to the best beaches - great food- and a short trip to go to Zicatela. Pancho the dog is the world's best hostel dog. You need to stay here! Absolutely perfect. Cole of Canada highly recommends."
50,"Vivo escondido is the place to be if you’re in town! The hostel is well taking care of and you have everything you need right there! The staff was always very helpful and just overall good vibes all around! I definitely had an amazing stay and even felt like home! Thank you,Vivo! "
50,"This hostel is what Puerto Escondido is all about: it's beautiful, very relaxed, good food and you can swim!  Good hostel atmosphere around the pool as well, when you just want to chill there's always someone else to share a beer and story with."
50,"This hostel is a little piece of heaven and has everything you are looking for: amazing people, a pool, a bar, a chilled vibe and clean facilities. I was supposed to stay one night and ended up staying three weeks. You are a minute away from the main road where you can find cute restaurants, surf shops and a mini market. If you are a beginner and want to surf the surf school is literally down the road. Tommy (the owner) really cares about everyone who stays to make sure you have the best experience ever and always brings good vibes and organise pool parties or family dinners if we feel like it. He brings a super friendly atmosphere and makes this place feel like home. I will give it 6 stars if I could. "
50,"Arrived in Mexico and went direcly to Vivo. We were supposed to stay there for a couple days ended up staying for over a week. Staff is amazing and the manager as well. Tommy you're the best. Hostel is clean, the beer fridge is amazing and the pool party was hell of a success. Unforgettable memories, thank you for everything. Even got a tatoo artist on the spot and 8 of us got a tatoo. Hostel is very big, place to do everything you want. Swim, read, relax, cook, etc."
50,"I have worked at the reception of this hostel as a volunteer for the past month, and I can assure you this place is perfectly amazing. I felt really proud working there: most of the guests would come only for few nights, but would extend their stay because they liked the place and the people so much and would not want to go. I dream of going back!"
50,"Had a nice and relaxed stay this year. It is a nice place with kind owners and people from different countries.  If You want to meet new people, go surfing or just wanna drink some beer, here is the right place.  Please do not expect any ""hotel feeling"", but i think this should be self-explanatory by the term hostel.  I think once this was a standard living house, thats why the washing rooms look like a usual bathroom with shower & toilet in one room. But do not be afraid, You can lock them up ;).  Therefore also perfect for people who do not want to brush their teeth... beside a stranger  "
50,"I have stayed in 16 different lodgings in Puerto Escondido during the past 14 years andhave  finally settled on the Ben-Zaa as my favorite because of consistently good, home cooked food, best Happy Hour in town, large rooms with ocean breeze, clean swimming pool and airy patio where guests gather.. The location on a knoll near Playa Manzanilla makes air conditioning not necessary. Personal service is best I've found in Puerto. Taxis go past this hotel every few minutes and cost less than $2 to any of the beaches, night clubs, etc. anywhere in the area. Ben-Zaa is a great, all-around value for budget-conscious travelers."
40,We had the evening special meal.It was the best pork I have ever had in  puerto. Also great salad with fresh beet slices and fresh pepper wedges. Yum.  We will be checking the schedule for our next meal there! We went to the rooftop to watch the sunset. Excellent unobstructed view. Had dinner on second floor patio.
40,"I thought that this place was great value and in a top location. In between the centre and main beach and the best beach (Manzanillo). The rooms were clean and comfortable however they were looking a bit run down. The pool was well maintained and an added bonus. Although never having eaten at the restaurant the dinners looked like good value and quite tasty with a freshly made daily special. The cocktails also looked good. The atmosphere was nice however the american owner and their regular guests seemed to congregate around the bar most nights, this may be a bit intimidating for the other guests if not speaking english. It did seem a bit cliquey. Although, for those that make an effort to integrate and eat at the restaurant, i'm sure they would be very welcoming. The owner"
20,"We were recommended this place by a travel guide, which usually has great recommendations.  This place was pretty awful from the start. The staff were rude, asking us on more than one occasion if we were planning on staying until we had said, as they wanted to offer the rooms to waiting guests. We had made a reservation with them beforehand and found this annoying.  The bathroom had mouse droppings since we got there, and were not cleaned before we left.  The towels were so old they were disintegrating, as was some of the furniture.   We were not given an introduction to the place, and noticed there was a Christmas dinner happening for the guests (we assumed) but were not given concrete details when asked what was going on.   The only nice thing about his place is the location-"
50,Have stayed many times and will stay many more!! It is clean safe and without question the best food drinks and happy hour in town!! Sunset from the roof top holds some of my best memories of mexico!! The pool and staff are fantastic can't wait to get back there!! Viva Mexixo!  !
30,"The owners were extremely friendly.  Most of the guests were English speaking and seemed to know each other; at least in the winter many of the guests come year after year.  Loved the swimming pool and the view from the roof.  I had two reservations: the first is that there is just a very dim light above the bed so reading after dark is impossible.  The biggest problem I had was my room was on the ground floor facing the restaurant/bar which is the focus of the social scene at the hotel so you could hear every conversation from morning until the bar closed at 11 p.m.  So if you want peace and quiet in your room, book a room on the side opposite the restaurant/bar."
40,"This is my third visit to Puerto Escondido and the Ben Zaa....and definitely not my last!  I wanted to experience a part of Mexico and its culture that is not as heavily influenced by tourists as it is in other parts of the country. I found it here!  The Ben Zaa is an affordable, safe and clean hotel with a friendly atmosphere. It reminds me of the TV series ""Cheers"" ...a place where everyone knows your name. There are many people who are regular guests, come every year and it often feels like old home week each time I visit. Steve and Mariae Posing, owners of the property, wear many hats..local guide, personal chaueffeur, nurse, chef and bartender..to name a few.  They make me feel like I'm part of their extended family which I am eternally grateful for.    E.Yeomans - Banff,"
40,"Had a wonderful week in the real Mexico, not the tourist spots. This hotel supplies the basics, is clean and the personnel are all extremely friendly. The food is the best in the village. The fishing is great! At least it was when we were there. Happy hour is the best in the area and everyone congregates at the hotel bar. Fellow tourists were warm and inviting. Had a great time!"
40,"We have stayed here several times , and haven't been disappointed .. The food is the best we had in Mexico . The fishing was great . Keep up the good work Steve!."
50,"We first stayed at the Ben-Zaa in the early 90's.  Since then we have returned many many times (more than 15?) and have seen many changes over the years.  All for the good, including the addition of Steve to the family and his great bar/restaurant.  The managemant and staff are all friendly, curtious and helpful.  The rooms are clean and well kept.  The pool is a wonderful bonus and is always well maintained.  We have met many wonderful people here.  Happy hour  here is THE place to be these days!  We will definately be back."
50,"Super great place to stay.  Our suite was furnished with everything with everything we needed.  Super comfy bed.  The breeze flowed nicely through the open windows and the view was perfect.  Great pool to relax in at the end of the day.  Pretty yard with a collection of flowers and the wild birds were fun to watch and listen to.  Vicky, our host was really nice, accommodating, and helpful for local info.  I would tell anyone to stay here and we will be back for sure."
50,"This is a GREAT space, the pictures don't do it justice.  Perfectly situated within walking distance of Zicatela, but quiet and peaceful.  Beautifully appointed.  Vicki is an awesome host.  Can't say enough good things!"
50,"This is a perfect location - a stone's throw from the sea and close enough to the bustle of restaurants and nightlife of Zicatela beach (just a 5 minute walk), but peacefully tucked away. The ground floor apartment we stayed in was spacious and tastefully decorated in traditional Mexican style but with every modern convenience. Kitchen is well equipped for self catering. Doors open from the bedroom and lounge onto a beautiful private patio and shared garden with a swimming pool. Everything is immaculately clean and well-maintained. A shared rooftop terrace provides stunning views of the spectacular sunsets over the Pacific Ocean. Vicki, the owner, is friendly and welcoming to all her guests and a mine of local information and advice."
50,"This is a treat to stay at because Vicki is so welcoming & helpful with anything needed for a spectacular time. She is a wealth of information and such a pleasure to get to know. The suite is so comfortable, with a fully equipped kitchen, great dining and living area & an amazing outside patio. There is also a gorgeous palapa covered terrace on the top floor which is a communal space with the best sunset views around. The property & gardens are so beautiful & immaculately kept.🌺 Zicatela beach is right across the street and a great place to start a beach walk. It is very close to many great restaurants, bars & shops but far enough away to have some peace and quiet. We loved everything about Zicatela Suites and would come back in a heartbeat. 💓 I would absolutely recommend"
50,"Right across from the beach. Quiet, clean and well managed. 5 minute walk to restaurants, shopping and bars. Great price to be at the ocean. All rooms fully equipped.The pool was well maintained and Vicki the owner was always available with good tips on restaurants and trips to go on."
50,"This is a great apartment with lovely views. You go to sleep listening to the sound of the waves crashing onto the beach. It's quiet, but convenient for shops and restaurants. Vicki was very helpful in all sorts of ways, particularly in helping us get a taxi on leaving."
50,Vicki is an amazing host...so friendly and willing to help out if you need it.  The suites are a great size and an an amazing patio to spend your days along with the pool.  Location is great as you can walk to everything but are away from the noise of downtown.  Vicky knows everyone in town and can point you in the right direction...whatever it may be.
50,"We had the good fortune to discover Zicatela Suites and found it to be one of the best places we've stayed during our Mexico travels. Prior reviewers have said it all.  The location is perfect, several blocks from the main Zicatela activity and across the road from the wide, long Zicatela beach. The property is beautifully landscaped and the pool was a real plus (PE was hot!).  Our suite was on the first floor so we didn't have an ocean view (although we could hear the surf), but that was ok - we actually preferred our proximity to the pool and could take advantage of the rooftop terrazza for sunsets.  The suite itself was lovely - spacious, tastefully decorated, very comfortable, and very well maintained.  And our host, Vicki Cole, was wonderful - she made sure that we were"
50,"Beauty everywhere. Beautiful,the owner Lolo. Beautiful,the staff Nina and Mayaele. Beautiful the design of the place. You enter a green exuberant garden that grows around all the round rooms,your own hamaca, 2 rustic wood chairs a solid table, inside a confortable Bed with crisp linen,a spacious bathroom all of it very clean. You wake to singing birds, most relaxing and soothing hostel I ever been, and I have been to a few. Go and visit, to expirence it, i will go again with no doubt. The  crew very pleasant, helpful, all services very well coordinated ,it looks effortless but there is a lot of care behind every detail. A million stars to One Love an Puerto Escondido."
50,"What can we say, that already has'nt been said, another absolutely great month.We will definately be back sometime in the future. The rooms are bright,refeshing and relaxing,and Vicki make our stay very enjoyableThank you Vicki!. ."
50,"We were very pleased to find Zicatella Suites on our recent trip to Puerto Escondido. We spent a quiet and relaxing week in the ground floor apartment with access to a patio, swimming pool and  a beautiful garden.  The one- bedroom apartment is beautifully decorated with Mexican tiles and furnishings, spacious and clean. The kitchen has a full size refrigerator and stove, fully equipped with small appliance, pots and dishes to prepare our own meals and have friends over for dinner. The owner, Vicki Cole is a great host and resource for information on shopping, restaurants and places to see in Puerto Escondido and surroundings. She arranged for us a couple of trips and made arrangements for a taxi to take us to Huatulco. The apartment is within walking distance to shops and"
50,"This is a pretty, lovely place to stay. Every detail in the bungalow is following a concept, the terrace with hammocks comes with a great ocean view and the yoga classes every morning up there are great. Its quiet, its clean, its lovely. "
50,"Amazing hostel, super clean and delicious food (the chicken is great). Yoga on the rooftop, afterwards chilling in the hammocks on the roof. If you are a surfer the location is not the best cause its quite far from Zicatella and La punta (in the middle of those 2). Its quiet and the walk to the bars in La Punta is only 10 min. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Good price/quality"
50,"Each room has a special decoration based on different rock idols from the 60's scene, it is clean, confortable and picturesque. The restaurant offers a really nice menu full of typical Mexican food with a creative twist. There's yoga practices and you can get an awesome cannabis oil massage at the terrace with a view to the seaside sunrise. One minute walking to the beach and around 15-20 to the town. You can enjoy surfing or have different ecotours in the surroundings."
50,"Fab vibes, just relax! Great hostel, more of a hotel in fact with restaurant and facilities. Staff all round really attentive, there wasn't a single time we walked into the main restaurant/bar and weren't approached in seconds!  You really must eat there even if you're not staying in one of the serviced cabanas. The food has a really fresh take on some of the local vibes and is unlike anything we tasted locally in the time we were in the area.  Ask the staff about local sights and attractions, they gave us loads of helo and everything suggested was really worth doing.  All in all 100% the best place to stay and eat...and relax...."
50,"I found One love because I was looking for a yoga practice, so I decided to take the class and move to that hostel in that moment! The place is so beautiful, i love the owner's choices for the names of the rooms and all the cool souvenirs in the restaurant... <333"
50,"One Love is beautiful and has a laid back vibe that makes you happy to wake up there every day. The bar and restaurant are casual and friendly, but serve great food at reasonable prices. The staff really makes an effort to get to know you and make sure you're happy. They're always smiling and seem happy and that makes everyone else happy. The grounds are lush and thoughtfully kept up. We loved our room (much more like a hotel room and bath than hostal!) and the beach is 20 steps away. Thanks to all at One Love for a great stay!! We will be back!!  👍 "
50,"My parter & I had a really enjoyable time staying at this hostel. Our host was very helpful, the workers spoke great english and were always smiling and helpful.   The rooms are so clean, modern and the beds are comfortable. Bathrooms are really nice too. yoga space is epic.   All up - pretty epic spot!!"
50,"Relaxing place super close to the beach. Rooms are very clean, service is great, staff warm and friendly. We spent three days at the hostal and were sad to leave so soon!  Make sure you don't miss out on the restaurant, we had by far the best dinner of our trip here! Warmly recommended to all kinds of travelers."
40,Beautiful hotel on famous surfing beach with very big waves.  First class hotel.  Front desl a little slow and inefficient.  Nice pool area and service.  Very nice open air restsurant overlooking the beach.
50,The best hotel in Puerto Escondido located in the center of everything. The food in the hotel restaurant is the best in all Puerto. The rooms are clean. A roof top with hammocks and a yoga lesson every morning. The staff and the manager are very kind and helpful.  We stayed for a week and we enjoyed every minute.
50,"We have stayed at Hotel Santa Fe twice and it keeps its high quality standards very well. This last time I and my eife, and our daughter and her fiance, stayed for two days and enjoyed the place very much, It is very well located because you can walk by the beach on one side to the main Puerto Escondido Bay and beach, and on the other side to the miles-long Zicatela Beach, both very clean with fine white sand and  fantastic views of the Pacific Ocean. The rooms at Santa Fe are quite large and decorated in a nice simple Mexican style, with air conditioning, TV, Wifi and huge bathrooms. The gardens are filled with palm trees and tropical plants that provide cool shade in this tropical site. The pools are small but very well kept, one is for adults only. The hotel has very"
50,"Old Spanish style hotel.  Clean and kept up nicely.  No, it's not the  Four Seasons, but neither is the price.  Service is flawless and the rooms, especially the suites, are spacious.  Take a suite over the adult pool area and leave the whelps to the other pool. Excellent restaurant is part of the hotel.  This is our choice for every time in Puerto."
10,"The outside of the hotel and common looks nice, like old colonial charm but the inside of the rooms are disgusting and smell like mold. We requested to change rooms and the reception was very accommodating, however the room we were changed to smelled a little better but not much. The bathrooms are super outdated, the linens worn out and mold on the wall of the bathroom. Disgusting and over priced! "
40,"my wife and i stayed at Hotel Santa Fe for 5 nights last month. We booked & received a room facing one of the courtyards. The room was spacious and clean. The property is self-contained enough that it feels like a nice 'escape' from the beach scene when you want it, yet it's  located right on top of that scene whenever you wish to access it.  Sitting on one of the restaurant's beachside tables at breakfasttime is a relaxing treat! Don't forget also to check out Cafetal coffee roastery/cafe attached to the hotel; they are a true specialty coffee purveyor of Oaxacan coffees."
20,"I was there 5years ago and I had nice souvenirs. I went back last week to discover that it had lost all it's charm because it has been left to deteriorate. Everything is old and needs to bereft aired and renovated. We had hardly any cold water from the tap, no safe, the A.C. was very weak. There was absolutely no service at the bar or the swimming pool. Overall, find another hotel, it will at least be cheaper if not better"
50,"We used to travel to Puerto Escondido regularly.... always stayed at Hotel Santa Fe.  We went back, last week, for the first time in 25 years.  We were nervous that Hotel Santa Fe wouldn't have the same magic it used to have.  No reason to be nervous... it was just as charming and even better with the rooms and pool that wasn't there long ago.  We spent one very relaxing week and wished it could have been longer."
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at hotel Santa Fe. The grounds are beautiful with so many spaces to relax and soak in the Mexican culture. Beautiful tiles and plants in every view. We loved our room too. The staff was friendly and helpful The restaurant was a perfect spot to gaze at the ocean while delighting in a tasty breakfast with a cool breeze. 
40,"I really enjoyed my four-night stay here. It has the feel of a classic Mexican hotel with the older tile design in the courtyard and in the rooms. And the interior grounds are really quite pleasant. Lots of plants and greenery to keep the place feeling fresh and relaxing. Keep in mind if you are staying here that this place is a little bit older, so may not have some of the super modern fixtures you might expect. But for Puerto Escondido, this place is legit.   A couple of other observations just so you know what to expect ...   The mattresses in the room are pretty firm/hard. I didn’t have a problem with it, but keep that in mind. Also note the sheet and spread are fairly light, but I don’t know why you would need anything heavier in that environment.   The Wi-Fi (at least in"
30,"Must have been a great place years and years ago, but ownership needs to put some of its profits back in this aging property.  The floors are far from the shiny tile shown in the promo photographs and the glaze is almost completely worn off. Things like a lamp whose cord has been taped to be repaired and the tape is unraveling shows a lack of interest in the property in general. The internet!  Apparently the three legged, arthritic hamster that propels the system needs to be retired!   One the good side.... the staff is very friendly and helpful and does a great job overall.  The restaurant is also very good and we have enjoyed many meals there. Again, this once gem, needs an infusion, and that would make THE place to stay in Puerto Escondido."
40,"This Hotel is located one block from the tourist strip, and two blocks from the main beach called Playa Principal. Nicely decorated with bright colors and a friendly staff clean rooms no hot water, but you dont need it its warm enough."
50,"Even though there are hundreds of hotels in the bay area of Puerto Escondido,  I never felt the need to check any of the other ones out. The mayflower is walking distance from the main beach has everything you might need close by and has helpful warm staff. If you feel like staying in, you can curl up with a book ok one of the beautiful terraces or get a match of pool going with friends or other guests. I would definitely come back."
40,Stayed there just for one night!! Nice hostel with agood kitchen! Very close to the beach! The staff were friendly!! The beds comfortable and the dorms and toilets were clean!! There is agood chill area on the roof with apool table!!  Good location!! 
50,Wonderful experience.  Friendly staff and enjoyable guests.  Extremely close proximity to main beach and souvenir shopping. I would highly recommend a stay here of any length.  The host is most enjoyable with her many stories from over the years. A surfer's paradise.
40,"We had a private room with a balcony and partial sea view - really lovely although it's a shame there's no window, just the balcony door, so you can't see the view from inside the room. There's a window facing the internal walkway but you need to keep those curtains closed for privacy so not much natural light. Great to have a clothes rail and hanging space.  Bathroom was clean enough and the shower was hot with good water pressure.  Really nice communal terrace (although the atmosphere was a bit subdued, even over new year) and well located close to the beach. Would have been nice if breakfast was included but there's a good sized kitchen to cook in.  We were just about ok without air con at night as there was a decent enough ceiling fan. Bed was comfy. Overall good for the"
50,"Arrived from bus station and just had to walk down the first hill to find the Mayflower waiting for you 2 blocks before the beach! The balconies and terraces have beach views as well and the rooms are comfortable, clean with fan and lockers to store valuable items. I stayed here twice and the owner Minnie really helped to advise me on getting to Guatemala and back to renew my visa! I enjoyed two of the dorm rooms and even though he place was busy with travellers I had the dorm rooms to myself and the facilities were always available for use:) Dinner must be cooked before 10pm so plan meals accordingly. There are multiple floors and areas to relax, eat, connect to internet, play pool or chill with other travellers! The kitchen is large and well equipped with all the cooking stuff"
30,As many have said this hotel is in a great location close to the beach (2minutes) and shopping.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  A community kitchen for cooking is well stocked and a great place to meet other travellers. I recommend you buy your food daily as items do go missing from the fridge from time to time.  The lockers for the hostel guests were broken into one night and one traveller had 5000 peso stolen which put a real damper on her vacation.  Rumor had it that the relief night watchman was the culprit (not confirmed) so keep your valuables close at hand.  A short walk to the otherside of Highway 200 will put in the heart of Escondido with authentic street food and shops where you can spend an enjoyable evening with the locals. The kareokee bar neraby is loud and
40,"Well managed, Good Kitchen, Safe, Clean, Cheap...   I stayed for much longer than I planned.  Puerto Escondido is a nice place to visit. The Mayflower has a great location with several beaches in easy walking distance.  The kitchen is big and has everything I needed.  Safety and security are good, the staff keeps the property clean and are pleasant and helpful.  Also really close to the bus station and the super market.    Over all the mayflower was the best choice and I saved a lot of money and relaxed with peaceful enjoyment.  Additionally, I met a lot of nice people who care about the things I listed and picked the Mayflower for the same reasons."
50,"This was my third time to stay at the Mayflower. Each stay has been fantastic and I can't wait to return. The hotel is in an excellent location, 1 block from the beach and also close to shopping, restaurants and transportation. The staff is friendly,helpful and accommodating. The property is always clean. There are nice common areas as well as a kitchen should you decide to cook for yourself.  The hotel does not have secured parking for cars but on two of my trips I was on my motorcycle and they allowed me to park it in a small secured area on the roof that is street level behind the hotel. Just one example of their wonderful service."
50,"I had a chance to spend a week in Puerto escondido, which was one of the best parts of a lovely trip to Mexico. Puerto escondido has really fine beaches that suit all needs-one is famous for its surf, other two are much calmer and great for swimming, the place has a calm vibe but does get quite lively in some parts at night. Mayflower brought a lot to my stay in Puerto- it is a very good value, it has a decent common space where one can cook and great cheap fish in Puerto invite to do so, nice balconies to enjoy oceanviews and its position is perfect. Warmly recommended!"
50,"This hostel really gave us a family away from home whilst we were travelling and we would certainly recommend. Julio looked after us exceptionally and made sure our stay in Puerto was a great one. They were happy to book tours and events for us, and made sure our evenings were packed full of fun things to do. Great showers, each bed has its own fan which is a blessing in the Puerto heat, and there are plenty of places to eat just a short walk away. A great hostel made even better by the friendly and hardworking staff - notably Julio, Jay, Ana and Liza. A great experience, would definitely return."
50,"I've been in many hostels around Puerto Escondido and this is the one I liked the most! The people that run it make an excellent job welcoming people and make them feel at home :) They have karaoke nights which bring the whole hostel together. They do various other activities like beach volleyball, salsa lessons and burger night. They have a freezer full of paletas de helo (ice sticks), and they sell them for very cheap, I loved them! Try the vanilla one! They are also building a swimming pool so soon there will also be that plus! Rooms are spacious and equipped with a fan for each bed and air conditioning is turned on at night, so you'll sleep good, bathroom and kitchen are always kept clean. There is a very big courtyard and a garden with a few herbs growing like basil and"
50,"Recomendamos vivamente este hotel,  o melhor de Puerto Escondido! Don Firmin e Jesus Anselmo, bem como as cachorrinhas Lola e Jagger, são o que de melhor há no México e sentimo-nos muito bem recebidos nos primeiros dias da nossa viagem. Na verdade,  não apetece ir embora.  A calma, simpatia e confiança, aliadas à limpeza, sossego e beleza resultam numa vibração perfeita.  O quarto era amplo e espaçoso. Gostámos muito do pequeno almoço,  não incluído no valor,  tomado à beira da piscina que aqui se chama alberca. A dois passos da praia,  com bom WiFi e um jardim muito bonito :) e lugar para o carro. Num dia de sol até nos taparam o carro  para não estar tão quente.   Lugar para voltar sempre! Obrigada amigos. Até breve"
50,"Ame la amabilidad, es cierto que son habitaciones sencillas pero de verdad te sentirás como en casa. La comida preparada al momento y es delicioso todo,  ¡De verdad lo es! En general, todo muy muy bien y sobre todo limpio. Si vienen a Zicatela la mejor opción es hospedarse aquí. 💖"
50,"Quiere compartirles que en las vacaciones las playas más bellas de Puerto Escondido n el estado de Oaxaca. Puerto Escondido es un municipio que pertenece a la region de la costa; es un lugar apropiado para hacer varios actividades en el mar como surfear, ir en lancha, hacer snorkeling, bucear, nadar con las tortugas más grandes que hay en sus playas, visitar el aviation en Mazunte, o tan solo caminar por la playa bajo un maravilloso tardecer. El hotel palapas tortuga nos dieron la más mejor atención que se merece un cliente. "
50,"We stayed here for three days during a November deluge (the streets were basically red running rivers!) and the saving grace was the incredible cooking by Fermin, the owner of the hotel.  The rooms are basic, but large, and each has a decent balcony.  The pool area are well tended and clean, and when the sun did come out, we made the most of it Each day he would ask what we wanted for dinner and we told him to surprise us - and he certainly did.  Lobster, chicken mole and a to-die-for lamb dish that fell off the bone - every dish Fermin made for us was exceptional.  Will be heading back on my next trip, that is absolutely certain."
30,"Blocks away , great location. Slightly quirky small budget ( $450 pesos per )  with average Mexican bed & shower. Limited hot water as per expected & no electricity from 12-5. Otherwise fine for the experienced Mexican traveler."
50,"Hotel Bigu is without a doubt one of the best places to stay in all of Puerto Escondido. One of the few places that provided A/C in the rooms at a budget friendly price. Mario, and the rest of the family that runs the hotel quickly became family of my own after spending a few nights there. The close proximity to the beach, the quiet road it is located on, the easy access to a clean and well-equipped kitchen all made my girlfriend and I's stay there that much more enjoyable. I will certainly return here, and I highly recommend Hotel Bigu to anyone visiting Puerto Escondido."
50,"I had a great one week stay at Casa Bigu. The family who run it are really nice, the place is spotlessly clean, and it has a great peaceful and tranquil atmosphere. Room has aircon and shower works great. It’s one block up from the beach, a 2 min walk to the main surfing beach of Zicatela, and there are smoothie shops and breakfast and dinner spots within a 1-2 block radius. I would def stay here again. "
50,We had a delightful stay with Casa Bigu. We stayed there for one week. The staff are so sweet and always went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying our stay. The location was perfect. It’s a one-maybe-two minute walk from the beach! It’s also very close to many great food and drink options. We were very sad to leave!!!!!
50,"This isnt your hotel like a Fairmont or a hyatt hotel. This hotel has 9 rooms and a lovely family who have just taken over it. Without doubt best plesse we have stayed. The rooms are basic, aircon, bathroom, fridge and bed but honestly the people who work there made our stay.  From our room being cleaned everyday to them offering us fresh fruit from the garden to try everything was unbelievable. We couldn't have got through to our necr destination without the help of Mario. He is the main point of contact and speaks a little english but was willing to help wherever he could even when our credit card wouldnt accept to book flights he sat there and helped us through translating all the spanish. Hats off to this great little place.  Its close enough to Zicatella to enjoy the"
40,Only stayed one night but was very happy. (As all I wanted was a clean cold room). Great large room with table inside & room to feel at home. clean and neat. Good A/C. Friendly staff. Gorgeous pet rabbit & turtle in pond. Small-Medium size outdoor sitting area & make-shift ping pong table. I think there was a very small pool in garden but didn't use.  Location was ok - just on the edge of being too far away. As a solo female walking back at night I thought it was a bit dark & had minimal pedestrian traffic. 
40,"We stayed at Buena Onda for only one night as it was extremely popular and fully booked the following night. The cabañas are amazing! They are set out on the sand, surrounded by palm trees and immaculate gardens. Well groomed sand paths lead to the shared kitchen and bathroom areas, with a common area down by the beach. Bring insect repellant as the mozzies love this steamy setting, and also toilet paper as it appears to often be in short supply. Loved this place. Stay here. "
30,"We booked in advance one cabana and when we got there there was none available so they gave us a room inside the main building. The room was noisy and too warm. The following day they transferred us to a cabana and it was much better (or at least, what we expected). Maybe too much ""buena onda"" results in the staff not acknowledging that things like this shouldn't happen :)"
50,"My family and I stayed at Buena Onda for two weeks in November, 2012. We had previously known the owners from a while back having them visit us in Guatemala, so the minute my father and soon-to-be-wife decided they wanted to get married in Puerto Escondido, we had no doubt to stay at Buena Onda.   Upon arrival my brother and I were given a bungalow and my father and his partner another one. The bungalows were nice and cozy, the kitchen more than equipped and clean, and the general vibe spectacular. I was then a nosy 14 year old, but all the guests made no problem in befriending me and being more than welcoming of the new coming guests. It was evident why most of the guests there, were staying for a period of more than a week, and that is because of the neat little paradise that"
40,"I was travelling alone when I arrived at Buena Onda, but already on the first evening under the palabas it felt like I was having beers with old friends. Everyone was really friendly and relaxed. I recommend staying in one of the cabañas, which are really lovely. The dorms can get a bit croweded. I loved the tropical garden the cabañas were placed in.  It's very close to the surf spot La Punta, which is good if you are into surfing. For swimming, the waves at the beach right in front of Buena Onda can be a bit rough - but that might depend on the season. If they could do one thing better (to deserve the 5th star), they should be a bit more generous with their toilet paper: there was hardly ever any, so better bring your own."
50,- very friend owners - perfect vibe straight on the beach - cheap accomodation - family atmosphere among fellow backpackers - a little bit isolated (10 min from the center by taxi) which is perfect to relax in the hostel or straight on the beach.  Would definitely come again!  Stayed in Bueno Onda in July 2010.
50,"...a little oasis in front of the beautiful beach of Zicatela. Pierre and the others recreate a green paradise of palms  where the comfortable cabanas are hidden and filled with the harmonic singing of the birds who found a house among them. Even the dorms are extremely clean and quiet. Good vibrations, nice furnished kitchen and the volleyballs matches at sunset are something unforgettable. It´s a must."
50,"I stayed in that lovely place on the beach few years back for well over a month and simply had the time of my life! My whole experience was excellent, from the lovely owners a French-Italian couple who made everyone feel at home (great beach volley games chicos:) and the Charming Russian ballet dancer receptionist( loved the freshly squeezed Orange juice in the mornings) to the amazing palapas( traditional dry-leaf sun umbrella) right on the beach where you can camp in your tent, the cabanas( huts) that were full of character if you feel like spoiling yourself and the great common areas where we played music and games, had drinks or got lost in conversations. Great facilities, outdoor showers, toilets, a kitchen all well thought out and well maintained.There's also a hostel at"
40,"this is a party hostel which located at la punta. you have to take taxi to go into town or to get there. This hostel has cabañas and also dorm room, there's a common area and also volleyball field. The staff were friendly and nice."
50,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff is really really nice, and the location is beautiful, with a volleyball net next to the ocean and a beautiful view of the sunsets ❤️  The shared rooms feel a little cramped, but it's not that significant. If you would need a lot of private or personal space, maybe these rooms aren't the best option. Other than that, they're clean.  The only detail is that the refrigerator is really small, but that's my only complaint. I really recommend this hostel."
50,"Olivier, Christoffe, Pierre and the rest of the folks managing are wonderful.  I stayed there on and off for a month.  It seemed like they make it a point to learn all their guest's names, and they did as much as they could to get people informed about activities, food, or whatever people were searching for.  They all speak 3 or 4 languages as well.   The hostel is relaxed and clean.  The hostel asks for no late night noise, so people coming in from the bars quiet down pretty quickly.  There's an area out toward the beach where people can relax, eat, play cards or whatever.  A decent kitchen is there and can save you some cash on food.  The fridge is small but it works. Security is good - a big deal in La Punta as theft is common; there were many robberies in the area while I"
40,"I had booked one night in Osa Mariposa in advance but ended up staying 4 nights there. Very friendly staff that helped me out a lot with tips for restaurants, beaches and other things to do, like yoga. Simple and nice vegan food. Very simple rooms, with fan and shared bathroom. Very hot and humid during the rainy season (I was there in May). Close to the beach."
40,"I stayed one week in Osa Mariposa and it was a good damn week! Peoples over there are very relax and cool. Well the majority of them aren't mexican, the majority of them don't even speak spanish! AHah!  But the atmosphere is great, the food is very good. Thanks to the mexican cook ! The place is very close to the beach but you have to walk 5-10m to get in the first beach where you can swim. There is a lot of cats and they are very cool.  I would advice this place!"
20,"I´ll start with the good things: - One of the girls in the staff (whose name i don´t remember but she´s from Australia) is very nice and helpful - The bathrooms and showers are clean all the time  Now, the bad ones: - We reserved the private room since the official page says ""ceiling fan"" , which is not even existent and we had to ask for a fan. - The beds had a lot of dust - Our second day we woke up late (by 10 am) because we were tired from the previous day, and when we asked for our breakfast one of the girls told us ""well, the people woke up earlier and they had already eaten"" like REALLY? I´m on vacation and I am not paying for you to tell me when I have to wake up ... my friend ordered and I went to take a shower, then, when I wanted to order she told me ""I´ll take a"
50,"If you want to get away from it all, this is the spot for you. Hippie compound with vegetarian menu and nightly vegan family dinners. Simple rustic rooms with mosquito net and fan. Walkable distance to Zicatela beach and no more than 30pesos a trip. 7pesos for a collectivo. It is removed from the main drag and surf, so keep it that in mind when you book. But not another place like this in town and it's totally worth a few nights! "
50,"A group of four of us shared a four man dorm room here. Inexpensive, clean communal toilets and showers, a really nice communal area with hammocks and fans. This place is good- location is perfect if you're surfing La Punta, an easy stroll down the beach. The food here is some of the best we've had at hostels."
50,"well i had an awesome 2 weeks here..been a long time since i stayed in a hostal and didnt know there was such a thing as a veg hostal. the staff is fantastic wendy, blondy and the gang. the ambience is chilled easy-going informal funny cool smart. location great and price more than fair. food is good and healthy. many cool travelers attracted to the veg food so always someone interesting to talk to. only small drawback mossies are a bit irritating at nite i think a ceiling fan would solve the problem or bring spray. 3 thumbs up!"
50,"Staff at this place is perfect. They are personal, thoughtful and caring. The family dinners are not only a great idea, they are executed very well too - I ate stuff here that i'd never eaten before. The dinners an excellent way to socialize. The location itself is a bit outside of Zicatela which we liked as you have the option to go both to La Punta as Zicatela. Zicatela can be a bit of a tacky European beach place of sorts, so it's nice to combine it with the rest you find at Osa Mariposa. No brainer. Go."
50,"Is a nice place, warm people, now friends, I went there for some days and I stay for longer... Also I went back after some mouths. Now is on my plans going back. Clean, safe, close to the beach, nice food... And even more, definitely a place to stay for visit an amazing beaches!! "
40,"I really appreciated the cleanliness of the entire facility!  The food was amazing, and so filling!  I felt very comfortable and at home with the staff and it was an amazing place to unwind and cool down after long days at the beach.  A special thanks to all of the staff and volunteers who keep the place, clean, amazing and full of love!  Will tell all of my friends about Osa Mariposa and encourage them to take a Oaxaca adventure of their own!"
50,"Great place, perfect to relax after a few weeks down Mexico. No kitchen but amazing, fantastically priced veggie/vegan food which is great post taco overload. Bathrooms and showers separate to rooms but really clean. Rooms basic but plenty of fans and mosquito nets. Such a good vibe, great tours organised at a moments notice, nicest staff I've ever met and more hammocks than I'd know what to do with. The perfect beach escape. "
50,"I stayed here 2009 and my overall experience was a little above average. I was not necessarily disappointed but I was surely not impressed. I decided to give it a second chance and what a good decision that was! The hotel seems to be a completely new hotel. So many changes have been made it seems as though they decided to knock a lot of it down and rebuild. The Architecture is amazing and completely fits the vibe of Puerto Escondido. One thing about this hotel that I have always loved is the location, it is right on the beach(Playa Zicatela) with many restaurants and bars around. Another highlight of the hotel is that right in front of it are some pretty amazing waves which makes for great surfing and amazing views. My family and I were treated like royalty by the employees of"
20,"We stayed at the Rockaway for a week in Jan 2012.  The hotel has all the makings of a great little place - cheap cabanas perfect for travellers, and more sturdy aircon rooms for people who can afford the jump in price.  We stayed in one of the cabana's as a travelling couple on our late 20's.  They were rustic, but cheap at 250 pesos per night.  They came with mosquito nets and a private bathroom inside, so we thought we had a bargain.  The main problem with this hotel is the noise.  They are doing major building works on site - building a new block I think - and this starts every day (except Sundays) at 7.30am on the dot.  Being in a cabana you can hear everything, so it's a constant banging and drilling noise early in the morning every day.  Not only did we have to contend"
40,We stayed a week in one of the cabanas facing the swimming pool. The rooms are cleaned daily and have one double bed and bunk beds with mosquito nets on all and a really nice bathroom with shower. In October it is very hot. There's a ceiling fan and another larger plug-in fan and the room does cool down towards the morning. The swimming pool is really welcome (as it's a bit dangerous to swim on Zicatela) and well maintained. There's a small shop on site with cold drinks and snacks and we found the staff in Rockaway friendly and helpful. Take ear plugs as the bars close by can get really loud at night and go to Cafe Cito next door for amazing coffee and breakfast.
30,"During our stay it was really quiet (what we liked!) in compare with other accommodations. The rooms (double with aircon and van) are reasonably priced (500 pesos/night).  We think the employees are not really friendly. The options they offer are good: 2h surflesson for only 300 pesos inc. material and transport and a boattrip to see dolphins and turtles for only 250 p/p (we saw both!). The pool is nice but i wonder about the quality of the water. My white bikini turned into green after the first day and in blue after the second..  It's a shame that a lot of the beachcabbins are braken down to build shops (they are building at the moment). That's why there is no bar, restaurant or meeting place anymore and also the poolbar is no longer. If you want some fun with other travelers"
40,Stayed here for 3 nights in a cabana for 250p per night. Room had 3 beds and 2 fans and got very hot during the day. The cabanas all face the pool which can also get very hot during the day. But in the morning and evening is a nice place to cool down. Pool area is very socialble. Most nights we sat around and had a few beers and chatted to the other guests. The only negative was the very surley guy on reception in the afternoons/evenings. No matter how nice you were to him he would always grunt and be miserable.
40,"Zicatela Beach is the location to be in Puerto Escondido - the beaches are nice and wide with plenty of restaurants/bars and surfing. The Hotel Rockaway, just across the street from the beach was in a great spot!  It has a 24 hour convenience store attached to the reception office - big bonus. We stayed in an air conditioned hotel room (there are less expensive cabanas also). The rooms were basic and a little small but clean and comfortable. The small pool area was nice with a bar open on certain evenings. The Cafecito restaurant next door was handy for  grabbing a good cup of coffee in the morning and was always busy for breakfast. We were happy with the price and would recommend this hotel to other travellers."
30,"There's a lot happening at the Rockaway and most of it involves noise. When it isn't generating its own from the Friday and Tuesday night live music—and daily happy hour crowd (except Sundays)—the disco a few doors down the street makes its own significant contribution. Still, I had a good time and liked the central location. At M$250 a night for a cabaña, one feels a bit guilty making many complaints. But do bring your earplugs, if sleeping is part of your agenda."
30,"We were warned when booking that the hotel was noizy, and for the most part was not too bad and died down around midnight. New Years eve and the next night there were many 20 somthing crowd anf they partied all night. The rooms were clean, we had hot water and aircon, so found the hotel great."
50,"We arrived in P.E. without reservations so we walked around looking at different rates and rooms. Rockaway was by far the best deal we could find. I can't remember how much we paid...less than $50 for sure, maybe even less than $40, for a great room with AC. They also have bungalows without AC for much cheaper. Don't expect luxury - but the rooms are very clean and spacious enough. Perfect location! Right across from the beach and walking distance to everything (except the bus station - short taxi ride). The front desk was super helpful and set up surfing lessons for us. There is a pool in the middle of the courtyard - we preffered swimming in ocean, but the waves are big so I can see why some people like the pool. There is also a bar by the pool that was always busy in the"
50,"Me and my girlfriend stayed there for a week and just loved the place, it's location is right in front of one of the best surfing spots, Zicatela beach.     The rooms are very clean, we stayed at the cheap cabañas but they had also rooms with ac if you needed that. We looked at other hotels before deciding for the Rockaway and can say that you are not going to get a best price/quality ratio in Zicatela beach, there are some cheaper places but are up the hill.     There is a 24 hs convenience store right in the entrance of the hotel and thats very usefull, also a nice swimming pool and a small bar beside the pool.     Was a nice week we spent in Puerto Escondido, i read a review in this site not recommending the rockaway for couples and that's what prompted me to write as we"
50,"Such a great, affordable spot. Dan is a legend will stay here again for sure!! Views of the surf and right in Zicatela it's surf handy. There are a range of good rooms and a rooftop terrace to watch the sunsets or check the surf in the morning... Epic!"
50,"A group of three females traveling together, we had Casa de Dan recommended to us by friends who had previously stayed. Excellent recommendation. Wound up staying twice as long as originally intended.   The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable. Our villa had a great outdoor area complete with hammock, fridge and cooking facilities. The private bathroom was a good size.   For our last two nights, we stayed in the rooms above Dan's Casa which were lovely and comfortable and had beautiful views out to Zicatela beach. The staff were incredibly accommodating when we asked for extra nights to stay and very helpful with all our queries.   The food at the cafe is excellent and well priced. We had the fruit salad at breakfast nearly every morning - enormous, delicious, and"
50,"My sister has been staying at Casa Dan for a few years and invited us down. It is absolutely a hidden gem. Hard to get reservations depending on the time of year as they have many returning visitors, which they call home. They have apt type rooms, they all have a sleeping area, bathroom and kitchen at a minimum some even have a nice sitting area and balconies with different views. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the facility is very clean. Our room was cleaned every day, the smLl community is surrounded by greenery and walls with a gate thAt every patron receives a key with their room key. It is like its own little community with a cafe for breakfast and lunch, pool, sitting area and a common room with books and TV to use.  Only 2 blocks from everything you should"
50,"My sister has been going to Casa Dans for a few years, when she invited me I was a little skepticle, did not know what to expect as it is not a resort.  Trip from the airport was a couple of hours by car but not bad even though the roads were quite curvy.  The office was closed when we arrived but my sister was given the keys.  The front gate is locked at all times so you feel very safe.  We stayed unit Unit #1 which is one of the smaller bachelor style aptartments, but for 2 people is was great because how much time do you need to spend in your room an vacation anyways.  Staff very friendly and helpful, rooms cleaned every day, large water jugs availble at the office.  View from our room was great even though the balcony was alittle small, but it had 2 chairs, a small table and"
50,"From December 1rst 2015 through January 15th of 2016, I was able to secure a unit at Casa Dan.  Whenever I told a fellow guest, or a local of my good fortune, they invariably would ask me, “Who died?”  All joking aside, Casa Dan has a very loyal following.  Many guest book their return visit prior to leaving, and for good reasons.  I was very lucky as a first year visitor to get a room for 6 weeks, especially through the holidays.  Dan is a innkeeper of the highest quality with a great heart and sense of humor.  He is on the premises, and very approachable for help on a wide range of topics.  He knows Puerto Escondido extremely well.  His staff is amazing.  Isabelle and Yuri run the office.  They speak excellent English, and are also very helpful and responsive.  I also had"
50,"This place is amazing. Price is right, everyone is friendly, pool is great. Dan him self was welcoming. close to the beach. restaurant attached had good food at a good price.  stayed in #13 we had our own kitchen and patio. will be back."
50,Great spot for couples or groups. Good facilities in each room with large areas for relaxing or having friends over. Rooms are cleaned daily. Isabel and all staff are very friendly and helpful but office closes at 5 each day so get in any admin before then. Easy to contact them via Facebook to check room availability. Rooftop terraces have good views of the surf and location is only 1 block from Zicatela beach. Pool is kept in pristine condition and cleaned every morning. Would recommend to stay here for the whole time your in Puerto Escondido if possible. We had to shift as was booked out.
50,"The ""Casa"" is located a couple of blocks above the beach--and all the beachside activity--making it very proximate while also very relaxed and tranquil. Great atmosphere, including the excellent pool and the attached cafe, but definitely geared toward a surfing crowd. Will definitely come back!"
20,"stayed here cuz the lonely planet just raved and raved about it.  ...definitely overrated. pretty pricey for what it is (a very, very small space)- extremely rustic accomodations- no common area to speak of (so, no mingling with other guests), and, lap pool smells kinda funny.  restaurant attached is ok. probably better value for the money elsewhere. just my 2 pesos.  ..oh.. there's no maid service. no one will clean up.  wifi is slow to the point of non-functionality.  you WILL feel youre toughing it, here"
50,"I loved every minute of my time at Dans... and was already planning my return to Dans even before I had left The Casa!  The cafe makes amazing food, the vibe of the hotel and the cafe you can not beat anywhere in Puerto maybe even Mexico ..  It's laid back, comfortable, clean and can easily become your 2nd home.... And then just like most you, you will plan to go for a few days and then be on the phone trying to extend your vacation."
50,"Liz and her family do a great job making sure you have all you need for a wonderful stay.  They have everything from a dorm room to an apartment.  The location is great, close to everything:  mercado, beaches, restaurants, etc."
50,"The perfect place to chill. Its quiet and good to calm down.  If you want to do something,they help you,if it's a place to find or for some activities.  it's clean and the owners are totally friendly and helpful, that's the same for the people who work here!!!! It is really nice. The bed is good and its enough Space in the rooms."
50,"It was a really clean and comfortable bedroom, the bathrooms and showers are also real clean, there is a clean pool where you can chill, at night is really silent so you can sleep nicely   The people who work there are so nice and helpful, they received us before the check in time.  Is close to the market by walk and the beach.   "
40,"I stayed in Puerto Escondido longer than expected, but I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Casa Losodeli. The staff were very friendly, and there is a sense of community there between the staff and hostel."
50,Great place to stay in Puerto Escondido centro. Walkable distance from all the beaches (ZIcatela is a bit further maybe 45 mins walk). Walkable distance also from the market to buy cheap veggies and cheap restaurants.  Pool is useful when you are roasting and you don't wanna go to the beach.   Plus Liz the owner/manager is super kind and muy hermosa :)
40,"The pool and the common area are great. The rooms are quite basic and didn't have much atmosphere, but there was everything you need. We had an air-conditioned which is necessary! The hotel location wasn't that nice, because it was located in the middle of a construction side. Although it was quite near to the beach. "
50,We spent a week here enjoying the refreshing pool and lush flower garden with comfy hammocks. This is good place to meet other travellers and to join different organised trips. Communal kitchen area and breakfast patio. New apartments are being built and we got to stay last night in one of them! Big space with all amenities you need for longer stays as well. Owners are cool and so is rest of the staff as well!
40,"We happened upon this hotel after finding many hotels full and we were very glad we did. The staff, especially Liz, is very friendly and knowledgable. Our first night we stayed in the apartment because there weren't any regular rooms available. It was very nice and had a fully stocked kitchen. It would be a great option for people staying longer. The next night we moved into a regular room, also very nice but no TV. But, who needs a TV with a nice swimming pool and a short walk to the beach? Overall, the hotel is very nice. The only problem is that they are currently doing some construction which while we were there started around 8am on Monday but not on Saturday or Sunday. I'm not sure what the usually schedule is but it woke both of us up and we were on the opposite side of"
40,"We stayed in a private room with bathroom , their is also dorm rooms available. The kitchen was super clean, the rooms were also cleaned daily and the staff were very knowledgable about the local area and very  friendly to patrons. It has a pool  that is good to cool off .  The bus station is only 7 minutes walk away. A good find. My only hesitation is NOT about this Casa but  for readers to know it is about  20  minutes walk to the principle beach, and 15 minutes to   other nearby beaches."
50,"At first you find yourself in the reception where, whoever is on turn is receiving you with a smile and its gonna be happy to help you. Then you arrive to (in my case) 4 bed-dorm which is very comfortable and wide. There´s always free and functional wi-fi and if you want to eat cheap there is a nearby market. You can chill with the always-fresh pool or with a beer in the bar. This is a great place to meet everywhere people and having a wonderful vacation/business time."
40,Booked this place for our anniversary and it was a dream. The apartment was very spacious and nicely decorated. Very romantic. The pool was a great size and we usually had it to ourselves. Great service and close to the beach (10 minutes walking to the water). Would be nice to have breakfast included but then again you have your own kitchen for cooking and some restaurants close by. Neighborhood felt safe but not that pretty. Bed was very big and comfortable! The WiFi was a bit slow at times or didn't work for a few hours but I think that is very common in Puerto Escondido. Would highly recommend for couples.
50,"This is beautiful hotel in Puerto Escondido, maintaining all the charm of the original building (looks like it was some sort of church) and each unit is unique and full of character. The gardens and grounds are well kept and the pool adds a nice feel to the layout. The place is super chill - doesn't feel like a massive resort. The staff were respectful and helpful, and even gave us salt and tomatoes when we needed them while we were cooking something. The owner is very laid back and helpful. This place is also reasonably priced compared to similar offerings. If you don't care about being right at beach (which is only 5 minutes away), this is one of the best options in Puerto Escondido."
30,"Not the greatest little hotel in town but clean and really pretty. There is no restaurant associated with it but there are numerous within a 5 minute walk. There were not many people evident when we were there and the pool, which is surrounded by lush vegetation was empty. It was our first time in Puerto Escondido and I would rather have chosen a place closer to the main beach."
50,"We have just spent six nights at the gorgeous hotel suites.  Am full of praise for this  place.  It is one of those rare hotels that has the right mix of helpfulness,  but also allow you lots space and respect to do your own thing.  No long list of rules,  just an undertaking to care for the environment and be mindful of other guests.    The gardens are stunning and quite obviously Bernadettes pride and joy.  We saw a humming bird out of the window and lots of butterflies.    My daughter loved the pool,  it was warm and large enough for a good swim.  It is just a few minutes from two lovely beaches and there is a good range of places to eat very close by.    We went on several boat trips,  which the hotel can help arrange.   All in all a really stunning place,  couldnt have been"
40,"We stayed in a suite for our honeymoon, and the room was just beautiful. The courtyard/pool area is beautifully maintained with gorgeous flowers. My only complaints about the stay was that the surrounding neighborhood is a little run down, and at night, there were ants in the room. They didn't bother us at all, but nonetheless, a small minus. I would stay here again! "
50,"This hotel is in a quiet residential area of PE, the Rinconada. We easily walked to many delicious restaurants, were able to find a cab by walking down to the main road, a few blocks away when we needed.   The exterior of the hotel and courtyard are absolutely beautiful and very well maintained. The pool area was hardly ever used by anyone except our family during our 8 night stay. The gorgeous plants, palm trees and flowers created privacy and made the whole area feel very tropical. Pool towels are provided during your stay, you are asked to reuse and keep them for a few days, which we did.  Our family stayed in suite 5, it is a downstairs suite, near the rear gate. The door of our room opened to a courtyard with a fountain, the windows/doors opened with iron bars for security."
50,"On arriving and walking through the pool and surrounding area, I thought of paradise.  Lounge chairs, tables, etc, around the large pool with lush vegetation.  Our room was also impressive, nice living area with TV and table for meals, bookshelves, then kitchenette with everything needed, then nice bedroom, and the bathroom.  There were two French doors in both the living room and the bedroom, which had a nice iron work so no one could enter, plus a separate door that went to a small private patio.  Oh, fresh flowers in the living room too.  If we had to nit pick, the shower head was located high or positioned strangely, and there was no washcloth.  They did charge extra for the air conditioning to be on during the day, but we didn't bother."
50,"This is a really beautiful place - especially in March when we visited: all the blossoms were out and it was lovely. Very picturesque; just like the website photos.   We had a great little apartment: living room with TV, small kitchen area (which we didn't use except for the fridge), large bedroom, bathroom, and small outside terrace where we had our morning coffee.  Air Con only in the bedroom, but that was fine.   The owner lives in part of the hotel area too.  Like everywhere in Mexico the price quoted doesn't include tax, so be aware that you'll need to add approx. 20%.  It does tell you that when you book."
50,"Not my first choice to stay but a great one. I wanted to stay elsewhere but elected not to because of noise concerns. We made a great choice staying here. Clean rooms, beautiful landscaping, attentive staff and owner, and it has a pool. The pool is definitely a bonus when you are zapped from the beach and want to cool off at the hotel. Keep in mind that it is a Mexican hotel. Very laid back and a bit more rustic than an American hotel. Don't expect the Waldorf Astoria and you will not be disappointed. Walking distance to Playa Carizalillo, quite a few restaurants, small shops and stores, and to town if you enjoy walking and experiencing the culture. Otherwise it's a 25 peso taxi ride. Would definitely stay again."
50,"We love everything  about  these  beautiful,  fully equipped  suites. Will definately  be back. Garden and Pool area are wonderful and relaxing. Bernadette and her crew are great!  Friendly  and helpful.  Je t'aime le petit paradis en Puerto Escondido.  Merci bien, Bernadette! "
10,"BED BUGS is apparently a normal occurrence here. They didn’t seem surprised when I woke up covered in bites. For me this is the most traumatic thing that I vigilantly avoid while travelling. I never put my bag down near my bed, thankfully, but that was almost impossible in this tiny room with literally no space for anything but 5 beds.  No point even taking about anything else when you have bedbugs but I might as well:  at first the French receptionists were so lovely, and this looked like an amazing social hostel, attached to another hostel. Massive kitchen. Netflix room. Perfect right...? WRONG! Firstly I got charged 10 pesos more for a towel. Music from the bar pumped on till way past midnight. A/C was pathetic, and only came on between 10pm and 7am... what’s the point!? The"
50,"Cool place, good vibe and a new hostel so everything is relatively new. Good mixture of people from all over and stay are friendly. Do a surfing lesson with Coco, they have other tours you can also do. Good people to party with too "
50,I've been to Puerto twice now and Puerto Dreams is by far the cleanest and funnest place I have stayed! They're great at last minute bookings and the rooftop patio is good at all times of the day.  Great place to stay if you are traveling alone.  I 100% recommend this place.
50,"""So you booked for three nights? I'm sure you'll extend."" Those were the first few stentences of the guy who checked me in. And he was so right. I ended up staying in this area for almost one month and after traveling to different spots on the coastline I always returned to ""Puerto Dreams"", even if I liked the beach area more (you need about 15 minutes to Zicatela beach) and I wasn't really looking for a party hostel - which ""Puerto Dreams"" rather is. I could write about the great facilities (bike rents for free, surfboard rent, clean showers and toilets, awesome breakfast,...) but you should just trust me and the other reviews that you won't miss anything here. But there are a lot of hostels out there having good facilities. So I rather focus on what made my stay here special:"
50,"A friend was staying at this place and as soon as I got in all my other friends from back home were sending me messages ""I've stayed there as well!"" / ""Say Hi to...."" etc. I had the best time. I still feel sad I had to leave! The breakfast is amazing, you have the best coffee all day long, free bikes to get to the beach, easy going nights or cray ones, yoga in the morning, sushi nights: and MORE. Just trust me and book it now! The staff is the best you can wish for! <3"
50,"Puerto dreams hostel gives you simply everything. Its well located, has comfy beds, great breakfast, a super chill rooftop-terrace including a bar, free bikes, activities like bbq, temazcal or sushi-night,etc.  But what made me love the hostel is the vibe. You do feel like home. I met so many nice people there and the group that runs the hostel is just amazing. It was a blast! Keep going boys and anyone who is thinking about going to puerto Escondido; puerto dreams is the place to stay!:)"
50,"Before I booked my first night at Puerto Dreams I was told to just book a week because “you’ll love it”… I stayed for two. I could stay here for a month, screw it, a year. There’s really no good place to begin when it comes to what’s good about Puerto Dreams, it’s all good but let’s just tick off the big stuff.  The building itself is a 3 storey, labour of love erected by hostel people, for hostel people. Every detail has been ironed out, Puerto Dreams is a finished hostel but it’s only just getting started. This isn’t a money making operation, this is a lifestyle choice they’re generous enough to share with us. Sometimes hostels are amazing because they really don’t care, Puerto Dreams is amazing because they do, care. After two weeks at Puerto Dreams, this building is no"
40,"Got her late one night, no issues at all.  Stayed a week, had a great time and met a ton of good people.  The place was clean, the breakfast was amazing and the people working there are just amazing.  It's not on the beach, but you'd never notice by the amount of time we sent on the beach plus it's so convenient for everything else (laundry half a block away,  market a block away, grocery stores).  Plus the rooms are great and the AC goes on at ten, so that makes for a great sleep at night."
50,"Stayed for 2 night and it was great! The staff are so cool , make everyone feel like there home . They have free bikes to rent, surfboards for 7 dollars a day. The rooftop is really chill and almost everyday they organize a event (volleyball,party) "
50,"I travelled here alone but everyone was very relaxed and welcoming after a long journey! The guys who have set the hostel up have a huge amount of passion and skill. It's really brilliant what they have achieved. Although it's not near the beach, for me, it's a good opportunity to see different parts of the town and see how people live and not just be with other backpackers. The bar is also great and music choices :)  do the bioluminescence tour- it's magical."
50,We stayed here for a week.  The rooms are comfortable and well appointed but the bed is a bit hard for my taste.  The management were friendly and helpful.  There is a great view from the balcony and it is usually quiet and peaceful on the property.  The pool is small but clean and suited my needs perfectly.  The gate into the property has a security code.  Others have mentioned the noise and smell from buses.  They arrive for weekends with what looks like groups of Mexican tourists.  They do run their motors for 20 minutes at a time but we didn't find this much of an issue and our room was on the side of the building overlooking that street.
50,Villa Maria is the perfect spot to explore Puerto Escondido.  This beautiful villa is quiet and relaxing and yet still so close to the beaches and restaurants. We had so much fun exploring this place and the owners are full of so much suggestions and knowledge about the area.  Great place to stay!
50,"We stayed a week at las Turquezas and we didn't find any negative point. Quiet place, beautiful view (photos don't lie), swimming pool clean, beautiful appartement with climatisation etc... The owner is very kind and gives you advices if you need it. We also had a massage which was really really good. I would recommend it except if you want to stay in the center of course. There are beaches and restaurans near the house. Perfect thank you. "
50,"We just got back from a short stay in Puerto Escondido and our friends booked this apartment on Air BnB. The owners/manager went out of her way to greet us early, and to get us checked in as soon as we arrived (way before scheduled check-in time). The apartments were beautiful and very clean, with an amazingly well stocked kitchen. We were provided with beach towels and snorkels and they also offered chairs to take down to the beach. There's a great grill area with plenty of herbs to use right by the pool.   The apartments are a stones throw from a very quiet beach, and just a short walk to numerous other beaches with restaurants and bars etc. There's a small strip of bars and restaurants also very close to the apartment.   We were so pleased with the apartment, and would love"
50,"We spent a week at Las Turquezas on a whim - what a wonderful decision. The owner and manager are lovely people always willing to have a chat and offer sound advice on activities and restaurants in the area.  All apartments are spacious and have ocean views; the views from the upper floors are less obstructed and more private. Kitchens are fully stocked with all necessary utensils. There is a large supermarket a short taxi trip away. Taxi's come past the property regularly and most trips seem to be from $25-$30MXP.   There is a small, almost private beach in front of the property and Playa Carrizalillo is only a 10-15min walk away. We tended to eat in, though most restaurants close by looked quite good.  We were sad to leave!"
50,"The apartments, garden and pool are always clean and quiet. The Manager, Jorge, is always willing to help you and everything is doing very well.  Las Turquezas is one of the best option in Puerto Escondido for sure."
50,Excellent service and attention from the property manager. Beautiful pool area and spacious and clean apt.  We enjoyed our stay at Las Turquesas. I recommend and hope to go back again. Thank you for the kind attention.
50,"Our family spent a month at Las Turquezas, arriving January 20, 2015.  We booked a year prior so we would have the top floor, and enjoyed unit #5 immensely.  Spacious unit, very clean, anything we needed we asked Jorge or John and we immediately received it.  Perhaps the kitchen could have a few more items, we bought containers for cut up fruit, a broom and dustpan and a bath mat.  Beautiful views from our balcony and the roof, which we spent a fair bit of time on!  The on-site laundry was wonderful, and the pool very refreshing after a day at the beach.  Thank you John!"
50,"We have had the privilege of spending two and half months in Puerto Escondido. The last month was spent at Las Turquezas. The view is spectacular, wonderful sunsets and whale sightings from the deck. The pool and grounds are magnificent. The hosts and owners are super nice people. They are so accomodating and friendly. We were late in booking our month and had to fit into everyone' s schedule. So, we were in four of the six suites. For some that might have been an inconveience  but for us it was an opportunity that we found delightful. Suite five and six of the top floor have great views and wonderful breezes. Suite four on the second level has an equally great view and  deck is shaded by a palm that leaves you feeling like you are sitting on top  of the tree with the birds."
50,"Just finished three weeks at Las Turquezas and had a great trip. The accommodation is wonderful. Rooms are spacious , everything extremely clean and view of the ocean and sunsets spectacular . The garden and pool area are very nice as well.The owner John is around daily and very helpful with anything you might need. All areas of Puerto Escondido can be walked from here and the taxi's are only 20-25 pesos anywhere. Weather was warm, warm,warm with sunshine daily:)"
50,"We spent 3 wonderful weeks in Las Turquezas, wich are in fron of a beach witouth people. And i tjink that its the goal, besides the sounds on the night from the ocean...and the rumor of the trees. In the apartment, you have a big kitchen, conditioned air, tv, and a terrace with hamaca. We have a daughter and was the best place for her. All is totally clean, even if you go for a short time there will be the best place on Puerto Escondido"
50,"Paul and Luisa are perfect hosts- gracious and generous,but also respect whatever levels of privacy you desire. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. From helping us get our plane tickets to driving us to the pharmacy to get medication for my son’s “gringo gut”. Very special place, very special people.     "
50,My family and I had a wonderful time with Paul and Louisa. They made our stay in Puerto Escondido a perfect companion to our time in Oaxaca City. Paul was very knowledgeable about the area  and the breakfasts were amazing. Highly recommended. 
50,"Paul and Luisa and Kaisia made our stay so welcoming.  The architectural components of the building was conducive to the hot environment and a welcome reprieve from a not so great stay elsewhere in PE. their graciousness and willingness to help us out was so much appreciated and we can’t thank them enough for inviting us into their home - their haven! The salt water pool and the organic meals were divine after a walk on the beach and hot sun and their suggestions as to where to eat and visit were always spot on. On a personal note, we appreciated their understanding in our personal situation which led us to leave way too early but if we ever return, we would stay here again in a heartbeat! We highly recommend this place for the tranquility, the privacy, the food but not of all"
50,"After 4 lovely nights in Oaxaca, we decided to hop on a 12 - seater plane operated by Aero Tucan and head to the beach. Luckily, I found Paul's place the day prior and there was one room available. Boy were we lucky!   What a beautiful space! I love the aesthetic of it. You walk in and immediately feel transported to serenity. There was a lot of thought and care taken in building Villa Maria  and you feel that upon meeting Paul and Luisa and experiencing their very special B&B. We stayed in a lovely room (no walls might I add) which was again very zen like, clean and completely surrounded by nature. If you want an escape and to leave feeling rested and recharged, look no further than Villa Maria.  Paul and Luisa were very accommodating. They greeted us with open arms and hooked"
50,"The property here is gorgeous with lovely hosts to support. It's like your own private mini oasis! With a salt water pool, very quiet & lush grounds, this is the perfect spot for a rejuvenating getaway. Aside from the property being completely sustainable, they feed you all fresh & organic meals! With all of this and just being steps from the beach, we will definitely be returning!"
50,"My husband and I have visited Puerto Escondido five times over four winters, and we've found it to be Mexico's best-kept secret coastal town. On our most recent visit, within this gem of a town we stayed at Paul and Luisa's Villa Maria, a delightful oasis near Puerto's gorgeous beaches and within walking distance to shopping and dining, etc. Paul designed and built Villa Maria, and his attention to detail is amazing, especially with his eco-friendly and climate-friendly design ideas. The pool and garden and outdoor dining and kitchen areas in particular are utterly magical! They give the serene feeling of being in a luxury resort, and I spent much of my time outdoors, lounging by the pool, even though the rooms are also lovely -- airy and pristine. One of the most awesome things"
50,"The suites are clean, bright, and very comfortable with an amazing shower and large bed! Breakfast is organic, local, and very healthy.. not to mention, absolutely delicious! The hosts, Paul and Luisa, are kind and caring people, ensuring that your stay is comfortable and relaxing. They provided us with information about all the amazing tours and places we should visit in Puerto. The pool area is also beautiful!! Definitely recommend this B&B to all. The location is super close to many beaches, restaurants, and local spots! We had such a good time!! Thank you :)"
50,"Villa Maria is truly a special place. Paul and Luisa are incredibly welcoming and thoughtful hosts. The property itself is designed beautifully and it feels separate from the surrounding neighbourhood while still being walking distance to great restaurants, shops and beaches. We stayed in the Sunset room which is like being in a grown-up treehouse. Waking up to the sound of the waves and birds each morning is something I will miss terribly. We also ate incredibly well as Paul prepares a delicious breakfast for you every morning with a combination of organic produce grown on their own ranch as well as fruits, vegetables and fish sourced locally. Both Paul and Luisa were incredibly helpful in giving guidance about activities in and around Puerto Escondido. I would HIGHLY recommend"
40,"Bungalows Zicatela, on Zicatela Beach was in a great location - a short walk across the street to the beach and central to shops and restaurants on Calle Del Morro. The rooms were air conditioned, spacious and clean but simple. The pool area is what prompted us to move here for the rest of our stay. We were at the Hotel Rockaway (just down the street) which is also nice but the rooms were smaller and the pool area quite small. The price we negotiated worked out to the same so we thought it was worth the move. The food from the restaurant was good - you could be served at the pool. Front desk staff were helpful and friendly. We would most definitely stay here again!"
50,"The family who own the place were soooo great and friendly.  The sons will help you with anything...surfing, going to the clubs, taking you to private beaches, etc.  We caught a fish and gave it to the restaurant and ate dinner with the family!  The location is perfect, right across from the best surfing beach and the lots of clubs for dancing at night.  This is a ""must go to"" hotel and location in Puerto Escondido!!"
40,"I have stayed there twice and the rooms are clean, nice and spacious. They have 3 great pools and an outdoor jacuzzi and are located at the most fun spot in Puerto Escondido: Zicatela Beach. Many restaurants and bars around and a nice beach right across the street."
40,Bungalows are big and comfortable with big bathroom. Hamaks on the tarrace make the place good for chill and relax. Localisation far from city centre but next to the beach. Beautiful garden with little pool. Breakfast are very good. Try the fruits cocktails.  Staff very friendly and helpfull.  
20,"We came here for dinner and the service was so slow! It took almost an hour to bring a plate of pasta and some plain rice. Friends of ours also waited 1.5 hours for their food. The staff didn't make eye contact once, and one member of staff was chatting on his mobile phone while serving us. They also let other customers smoke inside (illegal in Mexico). The service was so terrible we weren't planning to leave a tip, but then they had the cheek to include a tip automatically on our bill. The only plus side is that the food was quite nice once it arrived, though overpriced. Would not recommend unless you have no other option."
50,"We had heard amazing things about this hostel & were not disappointed. Lovely atmosphere and environment, yummy food, and friendly staff.  The location is very convenient, right by the beach and near the popular spot La Punta. Yoga in the mornings. Definitely one of our favorite hostels in Mexico so far! "
50,After weeks of hard work - my friend and I were looking into staying somewhere we could relax - eat well - enjoy peace and scerenity be close (but not in) the night life and have easy access to the beach where there are not as many people as others. That was what we wanted - a friend recommended to stay at this hostel. we booked 4 nights in one of their nicest room......... I loved it big space - huge bed - amazing shower - great views - friendlest staff ever - everyone from management to the the night keeper!! Life on the beach deffo does make you a happy person because everyone seemed to be happy with the world. The restaurant was great - good healty selection of food- friendly staff - cecilia/ Juan carlos / Mike and the whole rest were cool people. The wifi due to the region
50,"This hostal is perfect if you're wanting a quiet escape from the busy beaches of Zicatela and don't want to stay right in La Punta. Rooms were really clean, as was the rest of the hostal. Food at the restaurant is great but can be a little overpriced (and is closed on Mondays). There's a small kitchen located on site.  Our favourite part was the rooftop terrace which overlooks the beach. It has hammocks and also daily yoga classes are held up here. There isn't really any social areas to meet other travellers, apart from the restaurant. My only feedback is that on Mondays the restaurant is closed and we had an overnight bus to catch. There was nowhere the owner could recommend us to get changed apart from the storeroom and no bathroom for us to use."
50,"This is more than an hostal! I really recommend this place to stay! The staff is fantastic and the hostal is clean and relaxing! A nice bungalows are the rooms, with private balcony with hammock outside. Is really a paradise!!! As well the restaurant is deliciuos!! "
50,"A beautiful, serene, quiet, boutique hostal. The dorm rooms have a bathroom & shower, and cleaned daily.  Small pool for cooling off at the end of the day.  Upper terrace palapa for incredible sunsets, yoga, lounging in a hammock or a day bed and hanging out. The staff in reception, bar & restaurant, and cleaning crew were superior.  The bar & restaurant were amazing.  The food was excellent and very reasonably priced. I highly recommend the woodstock filet and the groovy chicken. An added plus for me being a cat lover were kitties Luca and Nina.  One Love went way beyond my expectations. Feel the love at One Love..."
10,"The place itself is quite pretty, very clean, new and with lots of plants. The pool is the size of a hot tub and the food in the restaurant is decent. However there is really no community vibe, you dont meet many people. The owner, who is always in the main area/restaurant was quite rude  and arrogant. He accused us of stealing a key, and then later of stealing a towel. We reserved for two nights and the morning after the first they moved us to a different room. After we checked out we stayed to use the wifi to figure out bus tickets and he was quite rude to us,  clearly eager for us to leave. He made my time there uncomfortable and I felt unwanted. I would have preffered to be in a shittier hostel than one where I am not welcome. Not worth it."
50,"Ok this place is just a paradise on earth. And that paradise is more than affordable !! Puerto Escondido itself is very quiet, with empty beaches and amazaing places to surf. One love hostel is very near the beach; you may walk right on the beach to go at La Punta or Zicatela and even downtown (taxis are pretty cheap if you prefer it to go around). I was in the female dorm and it was very clean. The landscaping is so beautiful, the restaurant is very good and the staff very helpful and friendly !!! Gotta have to come back !!!"
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed here about a month ago and we absolutely adored the 10 days we spent there! Our love for this place is so big that we still look at each other sometimes and say ""ohh One Love!""   All the staff are super nice and relaxed and happy to dispense advice on where to eat and what to do etc, the rooms are sparklingly clean and the whole aesthetic of the place is beautiful, colourful and tropical. It is a 10 min walk along the beach to the little hippie/ surfer enclave of La Punta. Also the food at the restaurant is absolutely delicious so you actually don't need to leave. Definitely a super wonderful place to stay! "
50,"Years ago someone plunked this gem in the best beach spot. You can walk to the left Azar sun rise and get to La Punta beach for breakfast, we saw one fresh turtle lay with broken eggs and 2 coral snakes along the way. Or walk to the right thru the incoming fishing Tanya's to explore the intricate walkway to the lighthouse. Both best done in the cool of morning. Get back k to jump in the pool. Hotel busy and diservse to be. Our nicest room so far."
50,"We spent 4 nights at this Mexican property. Lush tropical gardens, 2 pools, overlooking Zicaleta Beach. Hot sun, pounding surf made the ocean unsafe to swim or even stand in. Spectacular sunsets. On site restaurant serves no meat but makes up for it with seafood and varied vegetation choices. Pool side and restaurant service prompt and helpful. Rooms could do with a lot of sprucing up. Beds ok, though a bit on the firm side. Room had a small Juliet balcony. Good location at the quiet end of Zicaleta Beach. Easy walk to many beach side bars and restaurants."
30,"-Location was perfect. Right on Zicatela beach, walking distance to many bars and restaurants. -Room was okay. Bed was so hard. Old bedding and draperies makes the room look and feel really old and unclean. No hair dryer. The hotel itself has beautiful lush grounds with an iguana and a few cats hanging around. -Service?!? We sat by the palapa for hours and were never asked if we wanted anything. One morning we flagged down a waiter and ordered coffee. We then asked to see a menu. He brought us menus, set our table and never came back. I don’t think they were being rude, it seemed like they just didn’t know any better. All in all would only go back if I knew they had better beds and bedding."
50,"Not much to add to the other travelers excellent reviews of this wonderfully old property except this is a lesson in how to age your hotel gracefully. The rooms and common areas are a dream come true for people who love old colonial style charm. The pools are kept in pristine shape along with the grounds. Speaking of grounds, the coffee is something special here as they have a sister property that is a plantation. The food, yes, is vegetarian and seafood only, but is so freaking good we didn't miss the carne at all for a ten day stay. Incredible restaurant. Nicest people, warmest hospitality. I can not wait to come back next year. "
40,"Loved this hotel! Location on zicatela beach was perfect. Room was very comfortable, pool and deck were great. I will return and bring friends with me next time! The service at the pool was a little slow, otherwise I would have given a five star rating "
30,"Very poor service in reception, both at arrival and checkout. The factura (official bill) never arrived for the credit card charge and when I called to request it,  they had lost the information. I had called ahead to reserve a room that did not require stairs, because I was on crutches, and was told there was no problem.  When I arrived they opened up a room off the reception area, that they said they never use to see if it was okay. It smelled really moldy so I requested another room. I had to pay significantly more for a room that required going up a long ramp instead of two flights of stairs. On check out the same person who checked  me in was confused and charged the same rated as originally quoted then ran out to the taxi to request more money to cover the extra room"
50,"I agonised for weeks over my hotel choice in Puerto Escondido and finally settled on Santa Fe not sure if i had made the right decision........However, when we arrived I felt like I had landed in a lush leafy paradise......and was so chuffed with myself for choosing this hotel. Location wise it's perfect.....You are right on Zicatela beach.....close enough to walk to the beach bars and the action but far enough away for it to be quite tranquil and quiet and chilled. The hotel grounds, pool areas and restaurant are absolutely gorgeous.....lovely colonial style buildings with pretty tiling, surrounded with lush palm trees. We paid a little extra for a pool view room, next to the lap pool, which was well worth it because although it doesn't advertise it it does have a sea view. The"
50,"My partner and I spent 4 nights based at Santa Fe whilst exploring Puerto.  The best surprise for my vegetarian girlfriend was the restaurant (open to the public as well as guests).  It serves stunning authentic food without the need for meat - and as a meat eater, I didn't miss it!  We love exploring the local area around where we stay...  yet one day, we had all 3 meals at the hotel!  At the tail end of the rainy season, the hotel also provided a peaceful place to relax whilst waiting for the skies to clear.  Both pools are lovely and you can recline on the top deck staring out to sea for hours, with a cold beer in hand.  Rooms were good - A/C for those that need it, ceiling fan for a gentle draft.  Ideally located if you want to turn left for the beach or right for the town."
50,"My partner and I stayed at the Santa Fe for a week in August 2017 and we loved the place.  It has a great layout and there are shaded spots everywhere to relax out of the heat of the Mexican sun.  There are also plenty of spots to sunbathe with an amazing view of Playa Zicatela too, watching the huge waves smash the beach is mesmerising!  The restaurant is one of the highlights, a very extensive menu and every meal we had was tasty and of a generous portion.  The restaurant also overlooks the beach and has plenty of space and ventilation so you dont get too hot, the waiters are also very attentive, efficient and polite.  There are two pools, one for screaming kids and one just for adults which is nice.  All the rooms have air con AND a ceiling fan and so you can always retreat"
50,"The food is good, well prepared, the taste is good, the waiters are very nice and helpful and you have a nice view of the beach, which is very clean and cool.  Is family friendly and also have vegan options in the menu! "
50,"We stayed in apartment 1 at Casa Gio for 2 weeks. Gio was an extremely friendly, welcoming person. He went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay. He also told us about some great local gems to visit. He was always available to chat or provide answers to our questions. Our apt was clean, comfortable and quiet. We appreciated having a kitchenette with a fridge and 4-burner hot plate to prepare easy meals. The bed was soooo comfortable. We slept soundly every night.  We loved all the plants and greenery in the common areas. The hammocks and sitting areas were comfortable, and the plunge pool was exactly what we needed for a cool down. The bar area was cool and funky. Great idea to stock the fridge with beverages for the guests to"
50,Extremely clean. Spacious units with kitchenettes and comfortable beds. Beautiful garden setting. Away from the loud beach nightlife. Hosts Gio and Nayali were amazingly generous and helpful. Kitchenettes and a comfortable bed. Will definitely stay here again!
40,"I came a week early mistakenly. They were so kind. Gave me a better room for same price. Lovely gardens, a little plunge pool and wonderful conversations in the little bar area in the middle of garden. I really enjoyed my stay. Would recommend."
50,"Casa Gio is a super place to stay! I’ve been staying there for a longer period of time in one of the appartments. The place is nice, cozy and clean. The host is super friendly and helpful. You have easy access to the beach and different parts of the town and transportation is passing by close to Casa Gio."
50,"Casa Gio is a charming place with nice rooms, lots of hammocks and plants. The location is perfect, quiet but at walking distance from the beach! We hung out with Gio and hè even leant us his car, but he also respects your privacy. Would definitely go again, for longer ! "
50,"I had the pleasure of spending 6 weeks this winter at Zicatela Suites in beautiful Puerto Escondido. This property is situated steps from Playa Zicatela, one of the most beautiful beaches in town. The one- bedroom suites are beautifully appointed, very roomy and clean, tastefully decorated with Mexican style furniture and art, equipped with everything required to make home cooked meals. If you are not inclined to cook your own meals, this property is located within walking distance of all amenities, such as restaurants, cafes and shops. The host/owner,  Vicki Cole is a great resource if you need information about things to do and places to see in and around Puerto. She was very helpful for us Non-Spanish speakers in arranging, appointments, taxis and making reservations. I"
50,Had an awesome 10 night stay in March. Comfortable roomy apartment with a nice large deck where we spent most of our time when we were there. Beautiful and well kept garden and pool area. Very private as there are only 3 units. Vicki and the other guests were all very helpful in recommending activities and restaurants. We hope to return for a longer stay in the near future.
50,"We stayed at Vicki's place over New Year 2015 and had a wonderful time. There are 3 separate apartments each kitted out with everything you could need - bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, balcony, TV/cable, fans, cleaner, fresh filtered water etc We stayed on the top floor in apt. 3 which was great. There is a shared pool and garden area as well. Zicatela is a long run of beach with a strip of restuarants and shops running along the main road - Vickis apartments are a 3-5 minute walk to hear and you get to stay in a really quite end of the beach which is great. There are loads of nice spots to eat - Cafe Cito, Spirulina etc and other beaches to go and explore. The market is well worth a visit too to eat in the small kitchens there and also grab food at the local places in the main town"
40,"We stayed for two nights at Zicatela suites in November 2014. Vicki was very welcoming, helpful and accommodating. We booked very last minute and it wasn't a problem. The apartment is very spacious, lovely bathroom, good kitchen and very comfy beds! Plus the views over the pool and ocean are lovely, you can watch the sunset from the balcony. We only stayed two nights and because of our short stay could have benefitted from being a little closer to the central area but nothing was too far and if you were there for longer, this wouldn't be an issue. We really enjoyed our stay and happily recommend."
50,"We booked for a week and stayed for two! Zicatela suites is a lovely boutique property - only 3 suites - a short walk from the myriad of restaurants in Zicatela. We were fortunate to stay in suite 3 and enjoyed awesome views of the breaking waves relaxing over breakfast and pre-dinner drinks on our private balcony. The apartment was spacious, with well fitted out kitchen and really comfy beds. Free internet and cable tv was also a bonus for the couple of rainy nights we had off season. We love Puerto Escondido and really enjoyed our stay in Zicatela Suites."
50,"I stayed at Zicatela Suites for 6 days with 5 of my friends. Luckily we were able to take over the complex. The location is super close to everything we wanted to do like restaurants, bars and clubs but just far enough that there wasn't any trickle down of the noise or patrons. The condos are so clean and modern but with a touch of mexico. All the amenities you could need for cooking or resting at home. There is a 4th floor terrace where we collected every morning and evening to just watch the surf or the sunset from a hammock.  The pool is clean and shaded perfectly for either taking sun or cooling off. Vicki was so helpful with suggestions of sights and places to go out. She really knows and loves her town. We felt very safe being in her care."
50,"Can not express what a fabulous vacation this was. Zicatela Suites were spectacular! Vicki and her staff were kind, helpful, fun and accommodating. This place is a few blocks off the main stretch and a very short walk to town. Our group walked everywhere with no problem. The view is beautiful. The pool is awesome. The rooms are lovely and very clean. I will be back for a month next year. My new decompression location. Vicki has a new friend:)"
50,"My friends and I rented all 3 suites for a week and LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.  The owner, Vicki, is incredibly friendly and very accommodating.  The views are AMAZING, the suites are super clean, beds are comfortable, and the suites are walking distance to tons of restaurants and bars along Zicatela beach.  The next time I come to Puerto Escondido I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.  It was an absolutely perfect stay."
50,"My husband and I stayed a week at Zicatela Suites and enjoyed every minute of it...so where to begin.  Vicki, is, the, best.  From the start of planning the trip she was there to help.  She helped us get transportation from Huatulco and then once we arrived provided recommendations for restaurants and activities.  The best recommendation was getting to see the release of baby turtles.  She arranged for a taxi to come and get us and to make sure they would take us back.  As everyone has said, the suites are the best.  It's nice to be able to make breakfast in the morning.  Regarding location, if you don't like to be in the middle of the craziness and enjoy the calm of the beach then this is the place for you.  It's at the end of the beach strip and quite and secluded.  The walk"
50,"Zicatela Suites is outstanding! I wanted something special for our honeymoon that allowed us to get away from the mainstream and the owner, Vicki Cole, has done a fantastic job in designing an isolated escape. The pool is great and the landscaping is meticulously maintained and provides a haven for relaxing away from the beach. I couldn't get get over the atmosphere created by the pleasing architectural design. It was Mexican craftsmanship at it's best. It was fun being in a really nice place! Services and assistance was readily available. For starters, we were provided a bottle of champaign by the owner as a wedding present! Fernando was readily available with water. Vicki was available to help with anything that came up. She ran me down to the local farmacia when Marie took"
40,"we had a wonderful time the rooms are modist but keep well cleaned with clean linens and towels every day , the margiritas are the best in town and the food is great . the staff is very friendly and the views from the roof tops are wonderful you can see the whole beach and the mountains .  it is not a five star hotel but this is real mexico"
50,"great place to stay, wonderful food, chef steve is one of the best cooks I have ever had the pleasure of eating from.  Watching the sunset fron the roof was the prettiest I have ever seen.  Will go back many times"
50,"The Ben-Zaa is a great place if you like a family atmosphere where you can meet interesting people. The rooms are comfortable and the restaurant and bar are very well run and friendly. You could not be in a better position for getting to the beaches and the owners are fluent in Spanish of course but also in English so you can get any information you need about the area right in the hotel. For those interested in fishing this is a great spot, and the owner will do a great job of cooking your catch."
40,"The Hotel Mayflower is a great base  for when you arrive into PE, the location is close to Bahia Principal and a 10 minute or short scooter ride to Playa Zicatela. The service at Mayflower was really good and the helpful staff were amazing when I was lacking in knowledge for something, the rooms were simple, but it is all you need when you are at the beach."
30,"We stayed at Mayflower 3 weeks ago for 3 nights. The location is good, right in the middle of puerto escondido town with 2 second walk to the beach and restaurants. What wasnt good is that our room was infested with bull ants, they crawled out of the door handle every time we opened the bathroom door and were all over the floor when we slept. Also the owner is a very rude woman, we overheard her having arguments with customers two different times where she was very arrogant and aggressive!."
50,"At $200 pesos a night for a private room with bath and balcony, this was a steal. The hotel is spotlessly clean and right in the middle of the old town where there are fishing boats and a beach that is safe for swimming.  You might want to sleep with earplugs as some nights there is loud music nearby.    It is not in the surfing area but if you're not a surfer, and just want an economical and clean hotel in old Puerto Escondido, this is a great deal. I'd come back for sure."
50,Thank you Mina and staff for a lovely stay.   Hotel was spotless clean and across street from main beach..near stores and restaurants.  Very good value so I made reservations for a month next winter mack
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 13 nights at Mayflower, we originally booked for only 5. It's not located at the surf beach but it's an easy 15min walk. Located in an area with local restaurants and food carts (delicious!), Mayflower is the perfect hotel for people on a budget that want a relaxing time. We had a private room that had two double beds and a single bed with private bathroom, fan, TV and balcony. Only issue was the locals karaoke bar opposite that blasts music / terrible singers from 6pm - 3am; we wore earplugs and got used to it. No safety deposit but you can lock you precious items in a locker in a common area. Kitchen available but we didn't use it because it's so cheap in the area to eat out. Wifi is pretty average in rooms but for $25 a night, can't complain."
50,"This place was a steal at the cost. Clean, pretty quiet, with a kitchenette. Also halfway between the surfing beaches and right near the fishing port.  There was a lady incredibly helpful in reception and this service is unheard of.  Except for the shower dripping all night, I can't fault this place."
40,"The very nice women in front desk receive us and help us alot! She gave us ideas to visit, where to eat and which way continue! The hostel was very clean! They have in the entrance water to clean your feet. In the rooms have a fan ceiling I know one day is gonna change to minisplit! :D"
40,"If you are looking for a luxury hotel this isn't the place. Having said this I would recommend Hotel Mayflower for budget travelers. We stayed on second floor in a room with two clean beds and a small bathroom with shower. We were there in late June and had already been in Mexico for a month and a half, so didn't find the room hot. ( But maybe we were already acclimated to the weather.) Personally we had no problems with the staff--although sometimes we had a little trouble finding them. As far as nearness to the beach--as you can see by my photographs taken from the Mayflower, the beach is near. However it doesn't seem to have been so much a swimming beach as one that was used by local fisherman. I found this to be part of the charm of the real Mexico.  Other lovely beaches are"
40,"It is a very good choice. Much closer to beaches where you actually can swim. Very clean, nicely decorated and with all amenities. Do not know about dorms, but my single room was fantastic value. You might dislike a multitude of rules and cautions hanging all around the place - in this sense it is much more a hotel then a hostel, so if you are looking for party place, I'd say stay away. For me it was a great surprise and best place I stayed in Mexico."
40,"Came for 1 or two nights and we ended up staying a week. The private room we had was clean and spaceous with a working fan on the roof. The room was cleaned daily, which is great because of all the sand one brings back to the room once returning from the beach. The ladies did a great job keeping it clean.   Staff was helpful and welcoming. There is always someone at the reception desk. Wifi is fast.   The communal kitchen was clean and very usable. Don't expect gourmet but you can prepare a very decent meal. There was no breakfast but that was no problem due to the guest refrigerator and the supermarket nearby.   On location: close to the beach, bus station and the supermarket.   The busses usually leave after 5pm, checkout time is noon. In the meantime you can leave your"
50,"Vivo is a great little hostel in a very nice area. Tommy the owner is a Champion.. has all the walls covered with amazing art work from local artist. The shops nearby have plenty of good restaurants to close from and the neighboring beach Playa Carrizalillo is great for beginners unlike Zicatella which is more for advance surfers. It’s about 20 peso taxi down to Ziccaletta and about 30 to La Punta. He just installed Air Con which is a great addition. The breakfasts are great and the beers are there for you to help yourself, it runs on an honesty system in which you wrote your name down and tally your takings which are added up and put onto your tab in the morning (25 peso each). Enjoyed my stay and will be back for sure!"
50,"I was fortunate enough to spend Christmas at Vivo Escondido. They took out all the stops, there was a full English dinner prepared, there was music, dancing, volleyball and ping pong. The staff was more than just volunteers, they were friends. It’s an excellent place to go if you’re looking to find like-minded, colorful people looking to enjoy company with one another. I’m definitely going back, and you should too!"
50,"We originally only booked to stay here for 2 nights but loved it so much we ended up staying a week! Honestly could not recommend this hostel enough, we’ve been travelling for months and this is by far the best hostel we’ve stayed in. The owner, Tommy is lovely and makes sure he gets to know everyone in the hostel, makes you feel super welcome and part of the fam. The hostel itself is a kind of massive house with a load of different dorm sizes and layouts around a lovely big staircase. It feels like a big family place where if you’re not hanging out having some drinks by the bar or going out then you’re playing games. There are hammocks on the roof where you can watch the sunset or chill in the pool when you’re not at the beach (which is only 5 mins away). Thanks Tommy, am sure"
50,"A wicked place, these guys know how to run a hostel. The staff are super lovely, they know everyone's names and make you feel at home straight away. Vibes are great, there's always someone having (cheap) beers by the pool and it's just a perfect place to chill out in the sun. Nice beaches and restaurants nearby. The beds are comfy, bathrooms always clean and kitchen tidy and well stocked. Was a real shame to have to leave!"
50,"The hostel staff were very kind and helpful. The hostal was well located, close to amazing beaches and tidy.  It has an amazing swimming pool and all the breakfast were amazing each morning.  I will definitely come back soon."
50,"El hostel tiene todo lo que se necesita para pasar un excelente tiempo en Puerto Escondido. El staff es muy amigable y en general la gente que se hospeda ahí es muy linda. El lugar es limpio, la ubicación es excelente, incluye desayuno y en general la relación calidad-costo es buenísima. Conocimos gente increíble y volvería sin duda :) ¡Gracias al staff por todo!  The hostel has everything you need to have a great time in Puerto Escondido. The staff and the people staying there are ver kind, friendly and fun! The place is clean, it has an excellent location and it includes breakfast. We met amazing people there and I would definitely be so happy to come back! :) Thanks to the staff for everything! We love you guys!"
50,"I had a great time at this hostel, is my second time staying at this hostel and definitely will come back. Super friendly staff, clean rooms and special thanks to the lady preparing the breakfast every morning."
10,"Vivo Escondido was by far the worst hostel experience Iâve ever had.  The people staying there were mostly lazy, drunk longterms. On top a huge group arrived and behavioud awfully.  E.g. Guy puking in the bed, the hostel dog pissing in the room (staff was too drunk to clean it up), random creepy guy trying to sleep in one of our beds (while one slept in it)...  overall cleaness wasnât to great too. We left after one night to bonobo surf hostel (across the street) had the best time ever!!"
50,"Great social hostel a few minutes walk from Playa Carrizalillo, stunning beach. Only 45 pesos to Zigatela beach for the night antics with the top levels of the hostels getting a nice breeze when its hot. Super friendly and helpful staff, would recommend and stay there again.."
50,"Spoiler alert - we are older travelers- probably 40 years older than the average person staying at Vivo Escondido. And we had a very good time. We had a large upstairs private room and bathroom surrounded by an outdoor patio, zen meditation room and a terrace overhead. Very quiet and comfortable.The young people were quite accepting of us and seemed to enjoy engaging us in conversation around the pool and bar. We were even encouraged to select music to play. And we were captivated by their energy (well not in the morning), sense of adventure and general joy in life on the road. The owner, Ross, welcomed us. He was training several long time volunteers with hotel service backgrounds to run the place in his absence. Patrick and Anastatia took especially good care of us inviting us"
40,"This little place near Zicatela beach in Puerto Escondido is like a travelers dream.  The staff are warm and welcoming, the rooms are comfortable, and the food is great.  What more can you ask for?  Oh yeah, and the price is more than reasonable.    I stayed in one of the private rooms (with shared showers / bathrooms) and the mattress was very comfortable and with the mosquito net the bugs were not an issue for me.  Cold beers and a delicious menu are available at most hour (all vegetarian).  The beach is a 5 minute walk... The town can be reached via collectivo (about 6 pesos) or cab (about 35 pesos).  All in all, a perfect little place near the beach.  Thanks for the great memories!"
40,"Thanks so much for having me. You guys rock, a family away from home. Everyone that works there is super friendly and the food is amazing. Ill be sure to stay at osa if I visit Puerto again! Cheers familia"
50,"I spend a few weeks at Osa Mariposa, when i originally came for 3 days. The staff is amazing, the atmosphere is welcoming, friendly and fun ! They show you around, go out at night with you to party, and after 3 days you feel like home.  Yes, the rooms are quite warm and there is a lot of mosquitos, but you're in Puerto Escondido, what do you expect ?  I met awesome people and i will never forget about the time i had there. I can't wait to be back. I just wish there was a kitchen."
40,We stayed here for two nights in July on a Mexican Road trip. The accommodation is basic but comfortable. They offer a high standard of food with a family style vegan dinner in the evening as well as a vegan breakfast for very reasonable prices. Wendy and Blondie we're friendly and the consummate professional staff dealing with any request no matter big or small. We stayed in a private room which had a double bed and a ceiling fan which did a good job in keeping things cool at night. Mosquito nets are provided but would suggest repellent. The communal toilets and showers of which there are many were clean and well maintained. The hostel is located about 200m from the beach and is a good walk into the resturant section of Playa Zicatella.
50,I loved staying here and ended up there much longer than I meant to. The staff are so friendly and with family dinners every night there's a really good vibe. There is a vego restaurant and a mescal bar which is a good combo. The artisan mescal is amazing and the food is delish. It gets hot though so be prepared. 
50,"I stayed at Osa for 4 days. Although the hostel is a ways away from downtown Puerto Escondido, it is located exactly between two great surf beaches (La Punta and Zicatela). It is also a literal 1 minute from the beach, making it an excellent place to stay at while learning how to surf.  For me, one big advantage of Osa is the food. Meals are generally very affordable (50 pesos for a breakfast at time of writing), portions are good, and the flavor is amazing.  The dorms are fine, with surf bunks, smalls fans and nets that keep the mosquitoes out. They will not, in fact, keep the mosquitoes out, but a bottle of repellant goes a long way. All in all, I had an excellent time staying at Osa Mariposa, and warmly recommend it to anyone looking to vacation in Puerto Escondido."
40,"This place its just awesome, it's affordable and cozy, full of trees and plants, two or three blocks from the beach. We had a great time, met a lot of people from all around and by the time we had to go, we didn't want to. Plus, the staff it's incredibly nice and kind, they have mezcal, good beer (and cheap) food is good too! I am definitely coming back!!"
50,"I stayed at Osa Mariposa for a week and I was so sad to leave. The food is awesome and the staff is very friendly and helpfully. I bet you will find a lot new friends and have a great time. The vibe is totaly relaxed. I love the Hammocks, the delicious Smoothies and family dinner every evening at 8pm. Thank you so much for the great time.  See you, Andrè!"
50,"This place has an awesome atmosphere, it was so much fun staying here.  Super close to the beach and easy to get to Zicatela and Centro by either taxi or collectivo.  The food is sensational, I miss Sylvia's breakfasts and the family vegan dinners every night.  Great parties in the evening with some awesome infused Mezcal (the cinnamon is lethal) but they make sure the party finishes at a reasonable hour and you can carry on in Zicatela.  Most importantly this has the most relaxed, chill easy going vibe where you can do as you please and wont feel at all uncomfortable."
50,"Osa Mariposa is a paradise that is affordable for everyone!  When I first walked in I wasn't sure where to check in cuz it's that relaxed.  The staff was super friendly and made everyone feel like they're part of a community.  They have family style dinners every night, which are affordable, and optional (even locals sign up).  The rooms are cabina style, which I love... makes you feel like you're at one with nature.  Everything is clean and super relaxing, with plants, hammocks, and kitties hanging out.  They have a small menu with healthy food options (vegetarian), and fresh juice.  The mezcal is good too (must try cafe mezcal)!  It's located between La Punta and Zicatella, a little walk, or short cab away.  It's a good excuse that makes you get a little exercise in your day. "
40,stayed at dans for 1 month in october. Good vibes good people good rooms. enough said eh? Dans place is off the strip so its relativley quiet. the fruit truck drives around delivering groceries. i thought the kitchen in my room was perfect. all around good time at dans!
40,"A great pool, wonderful friendly staff in a quirky little hotel on the Heights above Zicatela.  This a a 3 star hotel that will feel like home.  Many people stay for months.  Dan will meet all reasonable needs you may have and you will meet people who will become friends year after year.  Surfers during the big surf season and snowbirds in the winter.  Canadian TV is available for hockey fans, and American and Canadian football."
50,"A very pleasant hotel indeed, well located near the end of Zicatela beach and excellent value for money. We had a very spacious room by the pool, with a handy kitchenette and balcony with hammock. The pool is great - it seems to be brand new and is kept very clean. The breakfasts in the adjoining café are very good - not included in the price of the room, but this is understandable since the rooms are incredibly good value. We stayed for 3 nights during the Christmas period, which is about as busy as high-season gets in Mexico, and most hotels will charge as much as they can get away with. Not so Casa Dan. We had to spend the rest of our holiday in another hotel in Zicatela as Casa Dan was booked up for the rest of stay - in the other hotel we paid more than twice as much as in"
50,"Dan is warm, welcoming, social, fantastic. The rooms are clean, in good condition. Awesome people stay there, so you meet a lot of people and everyone hangs out, so it is a fun ""hostel-like"" environment. Not far from the zicatela strip. Great views."
50,"As other have written Dans is full of surfminded people. I am an older woman who was visiting my surfer son and his girlfriend who live across the laneway. I felt right at home. I do live on a beach in Sydney, so I felt I fit the vibe anyway, but I thought  my age would be deterant for mixing with the younger crowd. Wrong. Dan made me feel relaxed and comfortable. Due to a booking problem (not theirs) they squeezed me in to start with, but I had to move half way through my stay. Not a problem. Isabel moved me to a huge room with massive balcony #12 cause they said it was my Birthday and wanted it to be special. So true. My son and his girlfriend were able to come over and cook dinner in the huge kitchen, so we could be like a family again. The pool area was relaxing and the"
50,"Wandering the streets of Zicatela I was a little sketched at first since my spanish is Muy Malo after the 5 hour red eye lay over in Mexico City.  My lady and I coined the phrase thoughts become things for the adventure and it did just that with all the high spirited locals, fantastic little resturaunte options, and your typical stuff you always have to get for the important people that didn't get to come on this one.  Locals you really need to get to know right away are the fishermen and the board repair guys. (who are living the high life I might add) they will get you whatever you need including big fish....cheep........and fast no matter what kind of day or weather they are having. Dans spot is secure, very clean with maid service to die for every day in-between whatever you"
50,"This place is amazing! It's close to everything you need, the beach, surf, spanish lessons, restaurants etc and anything else you can take the local transport for 6 pesos! (Or a taxi for 30) we had the best apartment by far, didn't see #7 but it looked like it had a great patio maybe with a better view. It was cool at nights with the ocean breeze coming through. If you are looking for a place to stay don't go past Casa de Dan!   Also the cafe downstairs make the best breakfasts and lunch if you feeling like staying close to your room and the amazing pool area!   Thanks Isabel and Dan for making our first visit to PE an absolute dream! "
50,"Can't recommend this place enough. We were in cabana 4 and enjoyed our own private kitchen, bathroom and patio areas. Dan's cafe was great with lots of fresh fruit and juices on the menu. Nearby there is a great taco spot called la olita which we personally thought was better than the much hyped ""fish tacos and beer"" down on the main drag. The pools is really clean and the staff are friendly and helpful too. Really great spot.  "
50,Casa de dan is a sweet spot in Zicatela. Awesome cabanas for such a good price. Includes a kitchenette fridge and own bathroom. Great big pool which is key in the heat. Close to the surf. Awesome Library of English books and they allow exchanges. The food at the cafe is awesome and prices are great. The fruit for breakfast is epic at only 29 pesos. Bargain central. Stay here in puerto. Close to main shops. And la olita for fish tacos.
50,"Perfect place to stay for a surf trip or a getaway, the locals are friendly and the atmosphere is awesome!! Cafe has some of the best breakfast, I highly recommend this for your stay in Puerto Escondido"
50,"Good place to stay in Puerto Escondido, very close to Carrizalillo and Playa Angelito. 3 blocks from Hotel there is boulevard Benito Juarez, with good places for eat ( el cafecito, luna rossa, paris le bistrot, almoraduz). Clean with  a lot of vegetation and nice pool to relax after a long day. Employees are very friendly! Neiborhood very quiet"
40,"a very nice hotel with big rooms/appartments, a colourful garden and a host that gave our visit a very nice personal touch. the first-floor rooms have a view of the ocean but we stayed in a room at the ground floor. that didn't matter much as the beach is close, as well as a nice street with good restaurants."
30,"the good:  well landscaped pool area,  clean rooms.  quiet.  nice restaurant 5 minutes away. beautiful beach 10 minutes away (170 step staircase)  the bad: cash only,  located 10 minutes from beach in a half finished neighborhood.  you will need a car to get to town.  the ugly: rooms have bad lighting."
50,"The Hacienda proved to be just the true oasis we had hoped for. The rooms are spacious and airy with basic but perfectly sufficient amenities. The central pool and terrace is quite simply stunning, set amongst one of the most pleasant gardens I have had the pleasure of enjoying. The small team always had a smile no matter how busy and really helped make our stay perfect.  The location for us was ideal. just 5 mins walk from Playa Carrizalillo with its high cliff surrounds and more laid back vibe. Surf hotspots and the best of the nightlife were just 5-10 mins by car away and cabs were cheap.  Whilst there are no meals provided, owner Bernadette offered us green tea on several occasions and the kitchenette facilities in the room meant that we could have easily prepared our own"
50,"We have just spent two wonderful weeks in one of the most peaceful, relaxing and beautiful settings you could ever imagine. The owner Bernadette treated us with the utmost charm and care. We always felt as though we were staying there exclusively, even though it was fully occupied. The pool was clean and inviting, set amidst stunning and exotic gardens. Our apartment was beautifully furnished and clean. We found this place an absolute sanctuary. Perfect for a romantic getaway and safe for your family. A special mention to Rudolfo on reception as he was charming and could not have been more helpful and attentive. A thoroughly nice young man. Many thanks we would love to return one day. John and Delia"
50,"We stayed here thanks to the recommendations made in TAdv. The hotel is beautifully decorated with spacious rooms and A/C (you'll need it), quiet location and relaxing scenery. The staff is not only friendly but helpful to give you tips to move around and eat on good and really close restaurants. The hotel only accepts cash, but you can walk or take a quick and cheap cab to the ATM (Not a big issue).  Even that it is away (5 min in a 2 usd taxi) from the main beach and Zicaleta, it is a 5-10 minute walk from two amazing beaches (Carajillo and Puerto Angelito) and close to the city's Airport and Bus Terminal.  On my next visit to Puerto Escondido, We'll definitely stay here again.  Tip 1: You can take the breakfast at El Cafecito, non-expensive really good and fresh food, close"
50,"The  French owner of this delightful cozy and well appointed hotel  Bernadette couldn't have been sweeter and more helpful . The rooms are all set up with kitchens and cooking facilities which we didn't use as we were staying one night only . There is a whole row of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel . Highly recommended by Bernadette is one called Paris , you can't miss it with  it's lit up frontage . Bernadette takes care of her beautiful garden which is full of all kinds of plants and flowers surrounding an inviting pool in the middle . The rooms are charming with a European touch in the embroidered towels , the bed covers and curtains . It is indeed like staying in someones private house . The front door gets locked at 8 pm but you are given a key to the back"
50,"Suites La Hacienda is a tropical haven of peace and quiet. Our suite was upstairs, with our own kitted out kitchen, water cooler, and spacious rooms. The pool area is gorgeous and relaxed - a good place to chat to others and never crowded. I also loved the in-house massages from Hortensia. Close to good restaurants and the wee cove beaches, I would return to La Hacienda in a heartbeat. Bernadette, Philipe and Rodolfo - muchas gracias for your genuine hospitality. "
50,"Absolutely loved it!  The grounds are full of different plants and flowers, a gurgling fountain and a sparkling clean pool.  We spent 4 days here and are already planning a return trip.  The suites are very spacious and the next time we would probably do some cooking.  Bernadette could not be nicer---in fact, everyone on her staff is a jewel.  We took so many photos of this lovely oasis so we wouldn't forget any of it.  We'll treasure those photos until we can return to the real thing again."
50,"We loved it here.The gardens were beautiful and shady with lots of seating and the pool was a great temp and spotless.Our suite was like a small cottage.spacious, well equipped and decorated in colourful and flamboyant style. The owner, Bernadette, was super helpful and really friendly, we would highly highly recommend it."
40,"Like so many people we ended up staying here longer than we meant to. We had only pre booked 2 nights and when we wanted to stay longer they were fully booked. We moved out of our room and went to the beach, the lovely lady on reception has great English and is really helpful, she did everything she could to sort us out a room and when we returned in the evening she had managed to get us a room in the new part of the building, which was huge and such a better room for the same price so we were really happy and stayed 2 more nights. The breakfast was 35 pesos extra and was buffet style with cereal, toast, a small choice of fruit and terrible coffee, I felt they could have done a bit more with the brekkie and for what it was it was a bit overpriced. The noise from the bar stops"
50,"I came with my boyfriend for 2 night and we loved the rooms! Its was so big and clean! But we were especially loved the stuff and Lis! She was so nice, informative and all you can asked for!  There is no way noy being satisfied with the rooms and the service. Great place! Go visit there!"
50,"We are a couple travelling through Mexico, central and south america. This was an excellent choice as it was our main base for exploring Puerto Escondido. It is a short walk to Playa Carrizalillo for surfing, Turtle Bay for dinner, the bus terminal for arriving and departing, and it is only a 35 peso ride in a taxi to Punta Zicatela.   Lisa was so helpful in helping us practice our Spanish. We asked if she would only speak in Spanish to us and she agreed. She also gave some amazing recommendations to check out around the place.  The rooms were clean and well kept. The kitchen was amongst the cleanest I have ever seen any hostal's. Breakfast is 40 pesos and gets you the basics of cereal, some fruit and toast.  Every Sunday night is movie night and everyone comes down to the main"
50,"Me and my wife stayed for 2 weeks at Hostel Losodeli in the summer of 2015.  Amazing budget hostel.  Communal kitchen is kept clean.  Cooking supplies and spices/salt/etc are communal.  We didn't cook, but we saw others doing so.  Great communal area outside that's covered.  The rooms are moderate sized and clean.  Filled with younger people and backpackers who were there to surf.  Great environment.  Wifi was good in the common areas and in the room.  The A/C (which you have to pay extra for) was heavenly.  Breakfast in the morning was sometimes an additional charge while we were there, sometimes not.  I never really understood the rhyme or reason to this.  (Maybe it depended on the cook?)  The coffee was free every morning.  There are communal   There is a pool.  We had no"
50,"Excellent choice for me. I had been backpacking through Cuba and Mexico and on my way to Guatemala. Friends back home advised me not to stay in acapulco, so I chose P.E. and this hostel. I found the booking procedure by email direct with the hostel, extremely prompt and efficient. When I arrived, I received a warm welcome. My stay of two nights turned into a few more than planned as I was comfortable and I found the premises to be clean and well run. The s/p area was a plus. Hostel is near both bus stations and all amenities. Thank you for a pleasant stay."
50,I stayed in the female dorm for 5 days. A good and clean hostal with a swimmingpool. It's close to a beach where you can swim. Obs the only negative is that with many people in the dorm it gets very hot and bring repellente for the mosquitos.Thank you hostal Losodeli for a nice stay!
50,"I loved this hostel. Its friendly vibe makes it very easy to meet other travellers of all ages and I did meet interesting people. The bar/common area is welcoming and sees quite a lot of action. Also, the kitchen is very popular with guests, which create a feeling of being at home. The staff is very sweet (Liz, especially; she is always smiling and taking care of everyone), very helpful. On Wednesday night, Liz took us to a turtle liberation activity on the beach and then we watched a movie on a screen set up on the same beach. That was great. I ended up staying longer in Puerto Escondido because of how much I enjoyed this place. The only thing I didn't like is that it's a bit far from the beaches, but the nice pool was much appreciated. All in all, I recommend this hostel. It"
40,"We stayed here 3 nights when we first arrived in Puerto Escondido.  We stayed in the mixed dorm  (6 beds) and only shared with one other traveling couple.  The pool was great!  Nice breakfast of fruit and toast.  Staff was great!  Only comment would be to add a main door to the women's shower area - a bit awkward the way it is.  The location was handy as it is close to the main Mercado, but we eventually moved to another hostel closer to the beach."
50,"Amazing facilities, right in downtown, (in between the amazing Carrizalillo beach and the local market Benito Juarez), Losodeli is not only a chill enviroment for those who want to relax, but also a great meeting point of travelers from all over the world who want to discover the wonders of Puerto Escondido. It perfectly combines the infrastructure of a hotel with the vibe of a hostel. Everyone here (Lizz, Lupe, Harvey, etc.) would go out of their way to make the most out of your stay. You become part of a big family from the moment you enter the door. They also plan daily activities that go from cinema at the beach to turtles release, salsa, barbacue... The cleaning service is amazing, and the types of room go from private appartments to dorms, depending what are you seeking"
50,"Hostal Losodeli is the best! The staff there really stand out. Lis and her team work hard and really go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and ensure your experience in Puerto is the best it can be. I was only planning on staying in Puerto for a couple of nights and ended up staying for more than two weeks! While there I stayed in both a private and dorm room. Both were great. The pool is awesome and an added  bonus. The layout of the hostal encourages social interaction which is nice and it is very close to one of the better beaches (though nothing is  far and taxis are very inexpensive by North American standards). There is a nice grill for barbecuing (maybe something you caught during the day), a bar and  a good sized kitchen. Breakfast includes toast (with delicious"
50,"Es un balneario muy divertido tiene tirolesa,gotcha,cuatrimotos, albercas grandes palapas,hamacas  la casa en el árbol y buen restaurante las micheladas están riquísima 💯 recomendando para toda la familia y pasar un día agradable el personal muy amable y siempre atento no falte nada felicitaciones 🎊🎈 "
50,"Beautiful hotel run by a lovely Mexican family that guarantees to make you feel at home. Ended up spending a month at this place because I felt so much at home here. It doesn’t feel like your typical hotel, but more like a cosy complex that feels very warm and very personal. Somehow it attracts just the right kind of people. My neighbors became my friends and then we all became like family, struggling to leave the place and move on. We organized breakfasts and dinners in the garden, or sat on the veranda of the family’s house, drinking beers and listening to Mariachi with the family. The rooms are well maintained and daily cleaned. The cleaning ladies made my mornings with their smiles and friendliness. The building is old, but that gives it its character and vibe. The rooms are"
10,"upon arrival, we were greeted with the words we did not pay enough for our rooms. After we showed the booking form she kept saying we underpaid, we told her it was something she had to sort out with Booking.   Next was the choice of our rooms, she questioned our room choice. We should have booked other rooms. We asked her what the problem was since we paid for the rooms we booked, so what did she care if it was 1 person per room?   So much for a welcome.   Then she gave us two run-down rooms that smelled of mold with windows that had no glass, the bed squeaked, the huge television was in a huge iron cage that you hit your head to every time you walk to your closet.   No aircon. Just a very noisy ceiling fan.   Not the room we booked, we booked aircon rooms.   So back to the"
50,I loved how it was traditional and had a lot of culture. Also they had a great pool and Service. And I loved their pet rule because I could bring my dog Sofia.  It is close to everything witch is so convenient. And I totally recommend it for your next vacation.
10,"I just came back a week ago from this place. I went with my husband, two small children and my two parents.  This place is NOT for families and i'm upset that the owner did not clarify this even though i asked him about it before i booked.  The only thing nice about this hotel is that it's right across from the beach, though most other places are. Hotel rockaway has two types of rooms: ones with AC (between $40 and $60 dollars) and bungalows without AC (they start at $18 dollars). The AC rooms are very nice (though small when they have two queen beds), brand new, and with shower and cable tv. The bungalows are totally crappy, with see through walls that seem to be made out of straw, hot during the day and with very little privacy. Also, they are very poorly structured to keep"
40,"Located on the main drag of Puerto Escondido's Playa Zicatela (a top surfing beach) and owned by a helpful, leathery ex-surfer from the Midwest, this hotel made me wonder if I'd just stepped a Jimmy Buffet song.   Palm-roofed cabanas (mosquito nets, ---shower-shave type bathrooms, hammock outside the front door) line two sides of the courtyard pool, while a strip of modern hotel rooms (A/C, spotless bathroom, cable TV) stretches along the back.   The fourth side of the pool is occupied by the palapa bar, which attracts a nightly (or afternoonly) crowd of salty, groovy, middle-aged gringos in tank tops. Even if you're not in the parrothead demographic (and I am not), after a shot of cafe mezcal, everybody's friendly. But if it's not your scene, I suggest the hipper, younger,"
40,"Pro: Clean, hot water, free bike rental, bar, ok breakfast, close to food market, cheap and delicious ;local food, netflix (only controlled by the owners)  cons: no yard, no pool, faraway from the beach, bot a nice area to walk around, aircon only on at night even tho it says 24hrs on the board.   not the place to stay if you are coming to a beach town"
50,"Super nice staff, really helpful with everything and generally a hostel that feels like they love working there. Breakfast was awesome. Could do with more attention to the AC - they forgot to turn ours on twice but we reminded them so it was no big deal. Would return "
50,"By far the best place to stay in PE! Accomodations are clean, seperate tv room, good rooftop bar/ social area and the only spot with air conditioning around! Walking distance to everything you need and always a great atmosphere!"
50,"I spent 4 nights in Puerto Dreams and it was a great experience. I felt like at home. Dorms are really nice, with good mattresses, individual light, plugs next to each bed, locker, AC, and even a curtain in each bed that gave some more intimacy. The common areas were decorated with good taste and were really friendly. The breakfast is really nice and the bicycle service was very useful for me."
50,"Where do I begin...  This place is FRESH. It's in town close to markets and the beach, with bikes for free use. The rooms are super clean and comfortable, they have everything you need- comfy beds, personal lights, outlets, curtains. The common spaces are warm and welcoming, the kitchen has everything you need to make a delicious meal with CLEAN fridges and endless filtered water and good breakfast included, the rooftop palapa is a great place to chill and relax with great music on play all day, and the bar is stocked up with any beverage you need and GREAT cocktails. But MOST importantly are the people here- the owners, staff, and volunteers go out of their way to make you comfortable and they are FUN! You can tell they truly want to make your experience unique and memorable-"
50,This place is  great to get information and meet great people.  My room was very clean and we'll set up.  Really enjoyed the common areas and kitchen.  The staff were super nice and helpful.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to meet people while traveling. 
50,"These guys are trying and succeeding. Wonderful new hostel, good layout, clean and secure. Bilingual staff really helps when one is confused etc,.. Great tips, free bikes and I think there are surfing lessons."
50,"The hostel is awesome! The guys running it are great. They try to help you as much as they can. if you need anything, they check it for you (bookings for trips or tickets, translations, etc). They created a fantastic atmosphere. We had an amazing time. The price for one night is unbeatable"
50,"Great place, we went there over a year ago when I was touring Mexico with my GF. The place had just opened and the owner made us tour the place to chose the bungalow we like the most. After a small hesitation between the Bob Marley and the John Lennon we decided to stay in the Lennon hut. The place was great, clean and affordable. Great service, do try the restaurant because their chef is really good and the prices aren't as expensive as in zicatela o the main beach. Beers are always cold and the view from the chilling deck is awesome. Will definitely go back when I come back home!"
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed in the Bob Marley room for three nights and loved it! We walked into La Punta everyday and a taxi ride to Puerto main centre is only 30pesos. The hostel is more like a hotel, so beautiful and an amazing top deck with beach views and hammocks. Great place to stay and between two people, a great price!"
40,"A great hostel' Everything is nicely decorated and the atmosphere is nice. The dorm I stayed in was nice and clean, and you get new sheets/towels every three days. There's a nice 'rooftop terrace' with hammocks to chill and enjoy the view. The jacuzzi (cold water) is nice chill in as well. Only there is no hot water! But for me that was okay. The wifi is not the best eighter. It's location close to the see, but you basically have to take a taxi every time you want to go somewhere..."
50,"Stayed at one love for about a week a couple months ago and would definitely recommend it. Pics on here don't do it justice, the place is literally a little oasis and very clean. Also the staff were all very nice and the food was great ( try the pizza for sure) Not in Zicatela, but about a 2 min walk from the beach and another 5 to La Punta, which I found a little nicer than Zicatela anyway."
50,"One Love was awesome! Super clean, spacious and cool rooms. Food was incredible (esp. their fish taco!) and the staff were fantastic & offered great advice. 100% recommend this hostel to anyone! Bueno"
50,I highly recommend this hostel to everyone staying in Puerto Escondido. The whole hostel is wonderfully built and the bungalows are very nice and spatious as well. Its very close to Zicatela beach and also offers a variety of delious dishes for an affordable price. Thank you Hostel One Love!
40,"The time I spent at the hostel was good. The owners of the place actually stayed there. We had a minor hiccup with our food service but the owners quickly fixed the problem when I called their attention to it. Unfortunately their staff is not very professional, really the owners are. It is a relaxing place for sure, and it is a little more secluded from the party area at Puerto, but it really is worth it. I thought that the hostel would not be as nice, but it was totally worth in value. Room cleanliness was not the best. Our shower was full of sand when we got there. Really those are all of my concerns, but they weren't that bad. We got some great advise from the owners on where to go and they had a good veriaty classes to sign up for. "
50,"After a very long bus ride, it felt we had arrived in the garden of Eden! This place felt like heaven, beautifully maintained with a lovely feel. We were lucky to get the Janis Joplin themed room, and felt very tranquil and relaxed, we instantly fell in love. The best was yet to come, the food was outstanding, I repeat outstanding! The steak was absolutely delicious, as enjoyed the sunset from our seat, the staff are great and super friendly, and helpful an lovely owners. Is this a piece of heaven on earth? Yes it is!! We would've love to stay longer, but our travels had to continue. Yes we will comeback, and a big thank you! Me n Jackie wish you all the best for 2015! Thank you having us."
50,"This hostel is simply amazing and so beautiful! The photos don't lie. Great and friendly staff who speaks Spanish, English and French fluently. Bungalows are so clean and comfy and you have your own balcony. Wonderful terrace on the roof where you can watch amazing sunsets. And what about the food at the restaurant.... fresh, inventive and delicious! We ate there almost every day (breakfast, lunch and dinner!) and the prices are very affordable. Not directly on the beach but Playa Zicatela is right in front (1 min walk). Very chill and relax ambiance... this is not a hostel for hard partying! Definitely recommend One Love Hostal!!"
50,"I have been spoilt living in  Sydney Australia having awesome coffee anywhere... So coming to Puerto ive been desperately trying to find a nice coffee... One Love has a beautiful tranquil ambiance, with attention to detail.  Lovely proffessional staff great service and better yet ive never been disappointed with there coffee! Definately the best in Puerto Escondido so far.   "
50,"We are always very comfortable here. They have everything you need, even for a long term stay. Great location, you can see Zicatela beach from the property. Helpful staff, always there when you need them.. We stay here every time we’re in Puerto and feel safe here."
50,"Here I am in Puerto Escondido, sitting on my terrace with my first morning cup of Oaxacan coffee, watching a school of bonita tuna boiling on the Ocean's surface about 300 meters offshore. That's the view I wake up to every day, immediately above a small, quiet beach called Coral Beach. For tne third year  I'm staying at the Las Turquezas apartments located in Bococho, a nice quiet neighbourhood here in Puerto. I stay for 2 months (Nov. & Dec.) every year and have truly found a second home here at Las Turquezas. The apartments whether 1 or 2 Bedroom are spacious and well equipped with a modern kitchen, comfortable living area and bedrooms. Multiple ceiling fans and AC keep it comfortable. The bathrooms feature a giant walk-in Mexican style shower. The swimming pool is very"
50,"I stayed in the beautiful ""Las Turquezas"" condimino with my girlfriend last year and we enjoyed every single moment! The apartments are located in a quiet and safe part of Puerto Escondido, just an incredible walk at the sea or a short cab ride away from the very center of the city. Next to the apartments you may find everything you need and wish during your stay in Puerto: little supermarkets, nice cafés, virgin beaches or a small bay that is perfect for swimming or learn how to surf... The staff, Katrin and Lucano, a german-mexican couple, is very helpful and friendly. Each need we had concerning the apartment, facilities or our holidays (good waves, restaurants, bars, clubs, hidden places...), they had a perfect answer!  We really enjoyed spending time with them when they"
50,We stayed at las Turquezas for a week. The first couple days we shared the beautiful two bedroom apartment with my dad and my sister (all in all we were 4) and we still had enough space in this big apartment.  There is everything you need: -comfy beds -spacious (fully equiped) kitchen and living area -fan and air con -big balcony -pool -fast internet -washing machine and very nice and super helpful owners.  The prices are very reasonable especialy if you stay a little longer.  We totally recomend this place!
50,Las Turquezas has been a great choice for us in Puerto.  Their rates are excellant and even better if you bring a group!  The apartments are well stocked with a clean full kitchen that saves you tons of $$ from eating out...The pool is right out your front door and the ocean view is fantastic!!  You can't miss but call ahead!
50,"Imagine relaxing in a hammock overlooking the Pacific high a top a cliff. Now add to that the incredible sunsets and you start to get an idea of what sets this spot above the crowd. When you have to go inside you will find a large well appointed living space and a kitchen set up for those wishing to capitalize on the incredible local fresh ingredients.  Six units ideally located within walking distance to great beaches and shopping. Book early as the word is getting out about this Puerto Escondido gem. Oh by the way John, Katrine and Lucano are great innkeepers and great company."
50,"las turquezas was great. we enjoyed the friendly atmosphere, the contact to the neighbors as much as the privat space. the appartments are spacious and tastefully furnished. the large balconys with the colorful hammocks are the best of it. In the third and fourth floor you have an amazing sea view. the place is very close to our favorite beach bacocho which is calm and natural. but after all we´ve most enjoyed the very nice and super charming owners family. thank you very much for a wonderfull holiday in paradise."
50,We stayed here for 1 month here with our two kiddos. It truly was the perfect spot. Katrina and Lucano were so responsive and attentive to any requests. You are walking distance to Bacocho beach and Carrizalillo(the most beautiful beach in Puerto Escondido). It is an easy cab ride to Zicatela(more touristy part of town). The apartments were so clean and it was easy to to prepare food. The price was very reasonable. The pool is so nice to use as well. I highly recommend you choose Las Turquezas if you are staying in Puerto Escondido.
50,"I have travel to Puerto Escondido several times and my stay at las Turquezas has being the best.  It has an amazing location.  The view is gorgeous, you are so close to the beach, to restaurants, stores and even and ice cream store.  Katrin and Lucano the host and owners make you feel right at home with their warmth.  They also keep the place really clean, they are always helpful and everything is set up for having a great time. The rooms are comfortable, they have fresh air and as I said before great view from almost every corner.   Las Turquezas is where I wish I was now.   Lili, CA"
50,"We were looking for an attractive 2-bedroom apartment and this fit the bill perfectly!  Nicely designed, airy, spacious and spotless with a user-friendly kitchen as well as an ample terrace with hammock and large dining table.  Plus a truly lovely pool.  Owners and staff are friendly and helpful without being intrusive. Advance booking recommended."
40,"Our first stay at Las Turquezas was in 2009 we were there for 5 weeks. John and Lucan our hosts and owners were the best in client care and the day to day management of our home away from home. The first thing was the price, we found it to very reasonable given where you are and how close the ocean really is. On our first visit we were shocked to find out there was no airconditioning well how were we suppose to stay cool in the 80 to 90 (32 celcius) degree heat. Las Turquezas was built with this in mind and we found there was simply no use for them. The breeze and roof fans kept our house remarkably cool. The unit itself was clean and spacous its decor is friendly and easy to keep clean. The pool ah that wonderful pool, we basically lived in the pool we found the ocean is very"
50,"Thank-you Vicki and staff for everything.  We just spent 2 glorious months at this beautiful location.  Everything from the room,  the grounds,  the staff,  the view, the pool, exceeded our expectation.  We are so looking forward to next year to spend more days relaxing in P.E.   Thanks again Jim and Linda"
50,"This was our third visit to Puerto Escondido and our first to Zicatela Suites.  Prior properties do not compare to what Vicki has accomplished in the design of the suites, landscaping and pool area.  We stayed for a very memorable two months this year, January & February.  Vicki and her staff were attentive to all our needs.  The suites, the individual patio areas, and grounds are designed with travelers in mind and they do not disappoint.  The location is great, an easy walk to town and restaurants and the beach."
50,This is my 3rd visit to Zicatela Suites and my first Christmas in Puerto. The Suites were like being at home. The large kitchen and dinning area was great for entertaining our friends The Suites are beautiful and everything is so clean. Vicki has done a great job designing and landscaping the yard and pool.
50,"The attention to detail in these beautifully designed suites is amazing! We were lucky to stay for two weeks and would loved to have stayed longer but this little piece of paradise on Playa Zicatela has been discovered. Vicki is a wonderful hostess who enthusiastically shares her wealth of knowledge of the area with her guests. We are now considering returning to a Puerto Escondido in the ""off season"" just so we can enjoy this awesome property & hospitality again."
50,"We just returned from P.Escondido where we stayed for a week. It was our first time in Puerto and the location was perfect for exploration. The house/apartment is new and well appointed. The hammock and table on the wonderfully shaded balcony were terrific for relaxation, reading and hanging out. Vicki is a terrific hostess. She arranged for pick up at the airport (the charge was standard and worked out to about $ 80.) She also booked our trip to the Hot Springs which we selected and which we enjoyed very much. The pictures do the place justice. The bed was comfortable. Great view."
50,"Absolutely love this place. We have been coming to Puerto for years and have stayed in all areas from Baccocho to Zicatela. Vicki has clearly designed these units as if she would be living in them herself . We stayed on the ground floor because we use the pool frequently and the barbecue but each unit has it's own charm. Love the fact that you are right across from the beach,close to the many restaurants etc. on Zicatela, but do not hear the noise from the late night action, and adore the 3 mascots of the property, Vicki's dogs. We felt extremely safe here and the beds are fantastic. (by the way, Ben, Mark did not make the ham and cheese,he just delivered it, but, regardless, we were happy to provide the cure for your hangover) if we had known, we would have made you the"
50,"It's hard to fault what Vicki and her 3 small dogs have managed to achieve here.  The apartments are spotless with incredible warm showers, super comfy beds, fully stocked kitchen, aircon in the bedrooms and killer view. You're close enough to the action to get there easily but far enough away to not be troubled by it. Vicki is a wealth of knowledge and is a fantastic host at all times. She's also got a wonderful spence of humor! I really can't recommend this place enough. I was so hungover one day and one of the other guests, possibly the biggest legend of all time, Canadian Mark, brought me out fresh papaya and a cheese and ham wrap...even the other guest are fantastic! If you're looking for a place to get away from it all and relax, this is a wonderful option."
50,"We recently stayed at Zicatela Suites and can't say enough good things about our stay.  The apartment and property are great - clean, comfortable, and with everything you need.  For us it was situated perfectly in Zicatela, just a short walk from everything (5 min) but far enough away that it was quiet at night.  Vicki was a wonderful host (even taking us to the pharmacy when I wasn't feeling well) and had great recommendations for places to eat and things to do.  I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to others."
50,"Zicatela suites is the most amazing vacation rental I have ever rented. The bungalows are incredibly well constructed, and has more than enough amenities to make your stay comfortable. The staff and the owner were SO nice and friendly and sincerely cared about making our stay special. Vicki is awesome! Cannot wait to come back and stay here in the future!!"
50,"I stayed at Zicatela Suites with my surfer friends, and chose this location because it was right in front of the beach. So, it was very convenient for us to just cross the street and go surf! And when returning back, there was a douche outside, providing convenient means to wash the surf boards (not that they were made for that). Vicki was super nice and showed me around once I arrived. She also recommended lots of cool places. I am glad I had the chance to check out turtles on one of the beaches with her. The swimming pool was clean and deep. The scene around the pool was beautiful too. The place has a cozy feeling to it. In addition, in August, there weren't many tourists in Peurto  Escondido (or around the suites), so I enjoyed the tranquility a lot.  If I were to visit"
50,"Was will man mehr? Kommt man im Winter aus Mexiko-City, sind allein die Temperaturen eine Offenbarung. Im Hinterland liegen die grünen Berge Oaxacas in Sichtweite und der Pazifik wartet! Das Lomas del Marinero ist eine sehr schöne Unterkunft mit ausgesprochen freundlicher Inhaberin. Authentische Lage etwas außerhalb des Zentrums in einem Wohngebiet. Kein Kneipenmilieu, wenig Verkehr. Zum Strand rund 15 Minuten. Colectivos an der Hauptstraße. Tadellos sauber mit gemütlichen Zimmern. Nach außen gut gesichert. Tisch und Stühle in bepflanztem Innenhof. Gemeinschaftsküche mit hervorragender Ausstattung. Sehr zu empfehlen."
50,"Walking into a hostel for the first time can be a little like walking into a high school cafeteria for the first time, so inevitably one of the first things I do is try to get a feel for the type of people that run the hostel,  as well as the type of guests that stay there. My immediate reaction coming into Osa Mariposa was extremely positive, I was greeted by really friendly people that were quick to help me with their local knowledge of the area and genuinely seemed interested in making sure that I got the most out of my time in Puerto. To be honest, I was going to leave after a few days because I was looking for a place that was a little more surf-centric, but I quickly realized that Osa was a much better option as I was able to surf in the day and then hang out with people"
50,"The hostel is nestled between  beach towns; La Punta and Zicatella. Although only 5 minuets from both, you are left with a more secluded stay off the main drag. The little wooden cabins are surrounded by the well looked after lush green gardens.  Even if you decide not to stay at the hostel I 100% recommend joining the staff and guests for 'family dinner'. Facebook or pop by before 5 (mon-sat) to let the staff know you'd like to eat the best vegan meal of your life. I'm a carnivore and I savored every dinner I are there for 30 days.   Stay here for a mixture of hammock reading and mezcal fueled nights out. You won't regret it."
40,"it's not a myth, nor a legend, it's true, ppl tend to stay longer then they planned! When you arrive first time in Puerto, on foot its not easy to find without good instructions. it's not a town center hostal, just ask a cab to save the trip. But when you arrive... holy Mari of Posa!!! they have shady hammocks around, cool beers, great food, friendly staff with their own state of mind, a backgammon board wich is daily played till you drop, or ask for the pig game. its not a real party hostel, but athmosphere is great! nice music, dancing, or whatever you like :) bar closes before 12. they offer open paycheck, so no grabbing for money all the time, prices are fair, just dont get crazy too much :) Dorms do are a little crampy, but beds are fine. they are equiped with mosquito"
40,"Rustic but clean, very relaxed hostel atmosphere. Staff extremely friendly & accomodating. It is a few minutes to the beach, 10 minute walk to the couple bars & restaurants in Punta,easy transport to anywhere else available up the hill and around the corner. As noted they do observe quiet hours which is good. Definitely would visit again."
40,"The shared dorm rooms are a bit cramped but the food, hammocks and proximity to the beach well made up for it. The central common area creates a great social atmosphere and the mezcal helps as well. Vegetarian options are often hard to come by so those looking for a little green in their diet will be completely satisfied."
50,"I got in Puerto Escondido travelling from Lake Atitlan in Guatemala at around 11am. After almost 30 hours travelling, I was welcomed by David and Silvia with a big smile, with a well decorated, clean simple place on the background: a nice common area, a restaurant (my first meal was ""Chilaquiles en salsa roja"" -- INCREIBLE!), hammocks, clean and spacious toilets and showers with large mirrors. The rooms are big enough to keep your stuff, very simple and cozy: mosquito nets, fans and hooks.. it is about all you might need, specially being only two blocks from the beach! The mezcal bar was the reason I decided to come here, and I wasn't disappointed: a good variety of ""mezcales artesanales"", some made in the hostel by the stuff (cinnamon flavoured mezcal is a fantastic medicine!)."
50,I came to visit Osa Mariposa Hostel with my friend days ago and Jade welcomed us with a big smile even she was busy. The peaceful and nice atmosphere are combined with a beautiful garden. Vegetarian and homemade food are so tasty too or you can order a cold drink. The owner Dan is very friendly as well  Thanks for your hospitality! and see you around amigos Cheers
50,osa.mariposa is a glorious getaway!!... the staff...the scenery...the service...are all ideal!.  you feel like you have found family away from home!!!! the food is fabulous!...vegetarian and! all homemade with lots of love!!!. nothing beats their sensational smoothies!  the garden is beyond beautiful!!!.  and! the place is immaculately clean. ...always. oh! it.s literally a skip to the beach... these bungalows are the best for any beach bum coming to surf both zicatela and la punta!!  stay here!!! you will be enchanted by everything!!!
50,"What can I say…I LOVE OSA Mariposl! So much in fact that I stayed at this lovely hostel for ~2months (05/13-07/13). From day one Dave, Silvia & Aquiles (Osa’s Staff) treated me like “familia” and after that I just couldn’t leave, except to go surfing.      Speaking of surfing, one of my favorite things about Osa is that it is perfectly located between “La Punta:” a nice left (point break) that almost never fails and the world famous Zicatela (aka The Mexican Pipeline). So depending on your mood, barrels or no barrels, the waves are just a short walk away. ALSO, when it is really small (~under 1meter) & glassy you can actually surf the beach break in front of Osa = no crowd, an occasional barrel & loads of fun.      Regarding “la comida”…the food at Osa is amazing. ”WOW!” is"
50,"I love this place. Delicious food and a great atmosphere. Always good music and very nice staff. The garden is so beautiful and you can get lost in a hammock staring at the flowers. I think there are the cleanest bathrooms of Puerto Escondido, jaja! Every time you are in Puerto Escondido, you should check out Osa Mariposa. Go for it. And maybe you'll stay there a long time..."
50,"Property has a beautiful, classic colonial design.  Tropical impressive landscaping.  Its location at the end of Zicatela provides additional privacy.  Pools and restaurant also make it stand out from what I saw elsewhere in Puerto Escondido."
40,"This is a classic hotel with a variety of rooms and a quite good restaurant.  An adult pool next to a large deck can make for a pleasant afternoon of watching some huge waves. The kid pool is in another area. The rooms are not fancy, but very serviceable and some of the larger suites have private balconies.   There is a feeling of privacy and quiet with a number of palm trees interspersed throughout the property. The beach is directly across the street and the wave action can be loud, but not disturbing - it's the ocean doing what it does best."
40,"We stayed at the Hotel Santa Fe for the second time in 3 years. The hotel is not over-the-top fancy, but gives you clean and spacious rooms in lovely surroundings. Most of the rooms also have a balcony or outside sitting area.  There are two pools on the property (one adult only) and a terrace overlooking the ocean. Although there are lots of rooms, the hotel grounds never feel crowded. The restaurant, which also overlooks the ocean, is excellent and inexpensive. The hotel has easy access to Playa Zicatela, Playa Principal and local shops and restaurants.   All of the staff that we met, whether front-desk, cleaning, or in the restaurant, were friendly and provided excellent service.  When we wanted to book reservations or taxis, they were happy to oblige. There is also a"
20,"The hotel expensive for what do you get . Cheap amenities, not even tisúes,  The hotel and garden needs a lot of maintenance, every day we have ants in my room. Food very good slow service but good attitude. We told the front desk that we are there for honey moon they didn't care. Very bad Attitid definitely will no comeback. "
30,"The hotel is a bit worn, but it is on the beach with great views from the restaurant.  The hotel surroundings are quaint and nice, but the rooms are a bit sparse.  Our shower dribbled adequately, but some more flow, and a cleaner shower floor, would have been nice.  It has air-conditioning - a plus."
30,"We had high hopes but were disappointed at the old, outdated rooms and the really dreadful bathroom. The room was small and austere with an old, faded, dingy bathroom. The room also has no safe!! You have to use a lockbox at the front desk. What an inconvenience if you need to access your valuables regularly.  The hotel exterior is a beautiful hacienda style with 2 pools: one general and one adults only. The general one had yelling children and the adults pool was smaller with less seating.   The bright spot is the restaurant! Amazing, delicious and with an ocean view.   Overall, the finishes and design of the property warrant a 2, maybe 3 star rating but anything higher is a long stretch."
50,"We've been staying here for more than 12 years.  A lovely, unique property with a first-rate and caring staff who are always ready to help.  The restaurant is beautiful and comfortable with a delicious menu and a wait staff who are always pleasant and attentive.  It is our home away from home."
50,"We were two couples, escaping a snowy winter in Vancouver, BC. I concur with what other reviewers have said, this property feels a little dated and it attracts and older clientele. That's fine with me! It was clean, quiet, and comfortable (no beds in Mexico are soft, but this one wasn't hard). We walked 1.4 k along the Zicatela Beach-facing street to Cafecita most mornings for superior coffee and breakfast. We usually made it back from our adventures in time for sunset with pina coladas and mescal!  Puerto Escondido still has its own rhythms, unlike some other Mexican seaside resorts with their international hotels and thousands of cruise ship shoppers. Nearby attractions include a lagoon with phosporescence (next time), horseback riding to a hot springs at Las Negras (awesome),"
50,"This boutique hotel is wonderful.  It is low-rise with gorgeous colonial architecture and two beautiful pools (one for families and one for adults only).  There was NO loud radio blasting.  The culture among the guests was refined friendly.  We met many Canadians and Europeans.  The weather is perfect (sunny with a breeze and about 80 degrees F every day).  Guests gather in the common area to watch the sunset over the ocean.  The hotel is decorated in a blend of colonial and Mexican styles, with gorgeous tiles on the staircases.  Our junior suite was spacious and had air conditioning.  Some reviewers think that the bathrooms need an update, but I liked the simplicity of the tile work.  I would not want an American bathroom, although I was grateful for a hairdryer.  The staff was"
40,"I love the Hotel Santa Fe -- I've stayed there six times over the last 25 years.   The location can't be beat on the border between the Playa Principal and Zicatela beach with unobstructed views of the oceans. They have one of, if not the, best restaurants in town and the service is always friendly (if occasionally slow). The rooms are comfortable and airy with both AC and ceiling fans. Several pools and house iguanas add to the ambiance. And the coffee is great -- but not available in the room.  THe WIFI is sometimes iffy but who needs to stay connected when the pacific ocean is right there?"
40,"Though this hostel wasn't close to playa zicatela (the main beach where all the restaurants and nightlife is) it was in good walking distance to the beaches you could swim at, essential for how hot it is in Puerto! There is also a little township nearby that has a number of good places to eat including a cafe that makes the best falafels! (The owner makes the pita bread and everything from scratch, he is very friendly and will come and chat to you while you eat). Taxis in Puerto cost maximum 30 pesos so it is very cheap to get down to the main beach if you want to!    Lis, the lady who runs the hostel is so friendly and helpful, she even took us to a salsa night with her which was one of the highlights of our trip. The rooms are basic concrete floors with bunks of varying"
50,"One of the best hostels we've stayed at. V clean, well maintained, and nice staff. Liz (front desk) goes out of her way to help you book tours, surf lessons, find restaurants to eat at... She's great!  Breakfast is good, a little on the small side, but there's a good kitchen and BBQ area where you can cook for yourself and loads of space to hang out in the evening and listen to music. The pool is amazing, lovely and clean and the perfect place to relax in the sun. Location is good, it's only a 30peso taxi ride down to the main surfing beach and lots of bars/clubs and the hostel itself is close to two smaller beaches, and some really good restaurants (get tacos at El Nene). The best place to stay in puerto.  Wholeheartedly recommend. "
50,"An absolutely wonderful hostel with a service quality of a five star hotel. Great service at the reception, great amenities: for 50$ a night we had a real suite with huge space, kitchen and a living room plus a balcony (also cable and flat screen tv)! They have a really nice swimming pool inside too. great location, close to three small beaches and all the restaurant and surf shops."
50,"I am traveling for almost half a year now and this is still the best place I have been. Great owners and awesome value for your money.  Never seen such a clean pool for that kind of money again.  Good location as well for beginner surfers and people who want to swimm, since close to the secluded bays in P.E. everything else easily reachable by a cheap taxis ride."
50,"This is the best hostel in Puerto Escondido, for sure. Good prices, awesome location, clean rooms, fantastic swimming pool and great staff. By staying here you also support the local business since the hostel owners are a mexican family (really nice, friendly and helpful people). Liz, Lorena and the crew will do everything to help you out, you can always count on them! I stayed in this place for several months! My plan was to rent an apartment but I liked Losodeli so much that I decided to stay there. I recommend it to everybody!"
50,"An amazing swimming pool, cleanliness standards that are more usually associated with good hotels and lovely staff. Liz's smiles, warmth, welcome and willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty are the icing on the cake. The location is great - easy walking distance to ALL the beaches, ADO bus station and various restaurants, cafes and shops. Everywhere is a feeling of airiness and space - the dorms are a great size and not the typical all-on-top-of-each-other rooms you find at many hostels.  WIFI works everywhere on the property. Absolutely nothing negative to write about this lovely hostel at all."
50,We plan to visit again.  It is a great place to stay.  I wish it were closer to the ocean.  Cabs are cheap and walking is an option.  On the other side of view the swimming pool is great and it is in a quiet part of Puerto Escondido.
50,"Stay here if in puerto,can't rate it highly enough.close to everything, great staff, friendly, organized outings.very clean, great swimming poo cleaned every day.it was like being at home.very comfortable."
50,"This location is excellent close to several beaches, restaurants, the mercado and super markets.  It is family owned and operated and the family is great.  The pool is a wonderful place to hang out and chill on a hot afternoon.  This will be my third year staying here and I will be back."
50,"I stayed here with my 5 year old daughter for one week to give my wife a week alone at La Punta at a health retreat and we had a great time and met some wonderful people there too. We stayed on one of the top levels that had a bathroom, fan and AC. Was a great size, level of cleanliness and the pool was much needed too based on the humidity. The staff were awesome too. The manager Lizeth has a perma-smile and helped a lot with directions and improving my spanish! Great place overall. "
30,"Room was clean and comfy.  I don't understand why this place gets ""Good location"" from other reviewers and LP.  The ""swimming""-beach that is nearby is ""littered with Fishing Boats"" and the sand is not great - really not inviting to lie down. Adoquin-street itself was dead. Admittedly I was there during ultra-low-season, but at least over at Zicatela there were some nice bars, coffee shops and restaurants. Adoquin seemed to me, to be more full of souvenir shops. Maybe it's different during high season?  Lady at check-in wouldn't give me my ""HI-discount"". Admittedly my Spanish is only basic, but she seemed to simply not want to understand this part of my conversation (she understood everything else)."
40,"The Mayflower was a generally very good hostel - it was very clean (and sand free - a hard thing to normally keep up when so close to a beach!), had pretty good facilities including a reasonable kitchen and the staff were very helpful, changing bed linen whenever asked and happily providing towels to borrow. The best things about the Mayflower were the proximity to the beach and the roof terrace! There was always a welcoming and friendly atmosphere up there, a great spot for chilling out and reading but also for lots of drinking games... The only downsides were that the dorms got pretty damn hot at night time so sleeping was not always easy, though if you're in Puerto Escondido you probably won't be sleeping much anyway (apart from at the beach!). Very nice hostel."
20,"Prior to arriving in Puerto Escondido, everyone seemed to have either been or be headed for ""Mayflower"". Having stayed there for 6 nights, I can't imagine why.  It wasn't terrible, but it was quite average.  The rooms were sweltering and despite my friend and I being the only two in a 4 man dorm, it was almost impossible to get to sleep in the stuffiness of the room. The fan was a joke - It swung violently on it's hinges and threatened to break free at any point and decapitate you in your sleep. Another running joke was ""breakfast"". They had 2 dispensers filled with cornflakes. No milk or anything else, just the cornflakes. I suppose this is an elaborate hoax to advertise ""breakfast"". The whole place is very tired and the facilities were quite poor. Just 2 showers were available"
40,"Comfortable private rooms, clean and with terrace. Clean communal area with spacious roof terrace.   Hostel is in a quiet area but close to the busy Adoquin street. Church bells may wake up guests in some of the private rooms... A few of reception staff seemed a little grumpy but overall a nice place to stay.   Although the nearby Adoquin street has some resturants and bars, I would say the main area for nightlife is on Zicatela, and takes 15 minute to walk there. "
40,"Good clean hostel well located an friendly staff. To many rules  you should be able to put beer in the fridge with out it being thrown out!!!! an rooms are very hot during the day needs better fans. Good wifi an computer set up, good kitchen an comfortable beds an good social areas..."
40,"Recommeded by a friend, i stayed 3nights here. I wasnt told anything on check in as my friend was there n he just left her to take me to my room n tell me the info of the hostel. He offered me zero info and didnt like being disturbed from the computer.  The other staff were really friendly and helpful. The rooms were ok but hot and the fans did nothing to help.  The kitchen was great with a huge fridge, all the equipment you need.  The location was great though in terms of shops and beach. Very convenient.  Overall my stay was easy and i found this place to be social n great to meet other backpackers"
40,"Good value room. Really clean and comfortable. The German owner is helpful and incredibly knowledgeable, she knows everyone in the area. The other staff are nice too, and you can bargin the room rate when it's quiet. Nice areas to chill out in and use the internet. Kitchen facilities are useful, although there are ants that bite! They let us borrow beach towels too."
30,"Stayed at the Mayflower for a few days in early January.  Room was basic (pte bath, small balcony, no a/c) but clean and well maintained.  Staff were friendly.  Did not see much of the other guests as I spent most of my time away from the hotel.  Good location on the Adoquin.  Overall I was pleased, especially for the cost.  I would return and would recommend."
50,"A charming little boutique hotel I found 3 years ago and keep coming back. the staff are wonderful (they have remembered me each time I come), very clean large rooms centrally located at main beach. I love the mix of backpackers and hotel guests, makes for a very energetic fun vibe. I am a former hotel owner/manager and I highly recommend this place to anyone passing through Puerto Escondido."
40,"Hotel Mayflower is a short walk from the shops and the beach, making it a very well located place to stay.  Thankfully it was also a decent establishment.  Our room was large, with two beds, a tv, a fan, decent hanging space and a bathroom.  You need to go up flights of stairs to get to all of the rooms even from street level, so it's only a place for those able to climb them.  The hotel has free wifi access, but I could only access it by sitting in a common area or the staircase outside my room.  There are also some communal computers.  There are good kitchen facilities and some excellent common seating areas, including a pool table upstairs.  This made it one of the most social places we stayed at.    One thing we welcomed was the ability to store our gear and have a shower"
50,"This hostel had a nice welcoming vibe to it, there was almost always a lot of people around willing to have a conversation with. The rooms were clean and had a good amount of space in them although they did get hot at night with only having a ceiling fan. The bathrooms were clean, however there was not enough of them as there were only two upstairs with showers to share between three dorm rooms. I did have to wait a couple of times in my three night stay.  The pool is a great thing to have, it was clean and so refreshing. The breakfast was great and varied and the had a fridge with beers available that was nice."
50,"I stayed here for 3 weeks and had an amazing time...it felt like home, the owners and volunteers were like family and the other guests were awesome...it was hard to leave and I would happily have stayed much longer. The hostel has a family vibe and is perfect blend of social and chill with lots of communal spaces to hang out as a group or alone. There is a beautiful rooftop area for yoga or chilling, ping pong table, books, games and a pool where you can play volleyball. The kitchen is huge, has everything you need and great for making your own meals. The hostel is always very clean and spacious, the rooms and beds are comfortable, and the bathrooms are nice and big. The location is great with beaches and shops within a short walk. They normally have social events like a bbq"
10,Be aware that this is a party hostel. Until 11.30 at night the sound system is pumping out incredibly awful music at max volume. The atmosphere is just awful. You can't escape it.  Just a bunch of drunk under twenty fives discussing where to score drugs.   Private room was very expensive for what you got plus you had to pay to hire towels on top of that. Stinking hot with no ventilation and a fan which seemed to do nothing at all except make a ton of noise which at least drowned out the awful music.  No hot water.   Wifi was terrible and did not work in the room.  And all common areas where the wifi does work are overrun with the pumping music.   
40,"Very socializing place. First evening there was a pool party (the pool is great by the way). There are many places to hang out (roof top with hammocks, hammock at the pool, sitting area at the pool and a hang out place inside).  The hostel is clean and the people are friendly. It is close to the center and the beaches. Would come here again."
50,"This place is fantastic! Great atmosphere, beautiful facilities and an awesome staff. As for all great hostels, I checked in for one night and stayed for a week.  The place is very clean and the interior/wallpaintings are exceptional. There are hammocks, ping pong, beerfridge, pool, rooftop and a nice kitchen.  Most people get together on the roof to enjoy the spectacular sunset.  If you're ever in Puerto Escondido this is the place to go!"
50,"Everything in and around this hostel is just great!the pool is clean, the common rooms inside and outside are comfy and invite to relax the whole day.the ping pong table is cool and so is the rooftop view and are.the atmosphere is perfect and manus breakfast stunning.it is not far from the beach at all and the place to stay in puerto Escondido.as a few people here already mentioned,you come as a guest and leave as a friend,I promise! "
50,"I was only planning to stay 3 nights in Puerto Escondido but I had such a great time staying at Vivo that I ended up staying 2 whole weeks.   This is a great hostel, there's a delicious free breakfast every morning and free yoga on the roof terrace. There's an honesty fridge next to the pool so you can grab a beer whenever you want, perfect if you just want to chill out at the hostel playing table tennis or reading a book in one of the hammocks.  The rooms are big and clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. There's a huge kitchen if you want to cook dinner, otherwise there are great restaurants and cafes just 5mins walk away. It's located 5mins walk from the beach and is close to the town, where you can take salsa lessons and visit the local markets.   I highly recommend. "
20,"We were very excited to come and stay here after reading all the reviews. We were in a private room, which was a decent size. Room was very hot with only one ceiling fan, would be good to have extra fans as puerto escondido is a hot place. Staff/volunteers were unhelpful and generally where missing when you needed to ask for information/help. Pool was fantastic, upstairs chill was awesome but I couldn't use it as the staff where always up there smoking weed.   During my stay my mobile phone was stolen, there were lots of people from outside the hostel hanging about one evening. Staff did not want to help at all, had to get a local from outside to assist with directions to police station to make a report.   The hostel had a great breakfast. Great location to restaurants (try the"
20,"Only need to say two words ..... boiling hot, I am still beading from this place it is a furnace I would literally rather stay in the centre of the sun !!!   However social is pretty good, so gets an extra star ! "
50,"I really dont know where to start here.....first off I booked two nights and fully intended to stay just two nights (stayed 12) but theres something about this place - both the hostel and P.E. that grips you and makes you want to stay here longer, cancel your flight home, quit your job and live by the beach forever! The hostel doesnt really feel like a hostel. It originally was just a giant mansion and then was converted. The dorms are very spacious, bright and airy. There are many places to go and relax including the rooftop hammock lined terrace, the pool (plus bar) and the mid floor terrace also. The staff are just one big happy family that you are introduced and welcomed into as you arrive and they couldnt be more helpful either. The pool bar has an honesty policy so take"
40,Had a wonderful 4 nights stay at Cabanas Pepa. Fantastic sea view from the room and balcony and a very clean swimming pool for cooling down. A lovely family run business with excellent hospitality. Will definitely stay again.
40,"Recomendable, Pepe y su mujer viven abajo, son muy serviciales. El espacio es silencioso y familiar lo que propicia un buen descanso,, las habitaciones son cómodas y limpias, con lo básico que se necesita, y sobre todo, baratas. Cuentan con una piscina. A 200 metros de playa Zicatela, a una calle de donde pasa el camión que te lleva a Mazunte."
50,"las habitaciones son amplias y confortables, tienen una exelente vista al mar, muy buena ubicacion a pocos metros de la bahia principal, hambiente totalmente familiar. 100% recomendable para pasar unas buenas vacaciones"
50,"My friends and I stayed at Casa de Dan for 12 days in March, we had rooms 7,8 and 10! I highly recommend staying here as it absolutely beautiful! You are surrounded by mango trees palm trees papaya and banana trees and a huge pool! Room 7 had the best view, a perfect deck with a hammock and a large living space! Room 8 also had an outdoor living space with a view, room 10 was back behind the pool but was still a cute lil room with an outdoor area over looking the pool with a hammock, oh and it was the one that had air conditioning :) the property also feels very safe and secure I was never once worried about my belongings.  You can walk right down to the main road on Zecitala beach (shopping restaurants beach clubs etc) and was only a 5 min (25peso) taxi to the swimming beach!"
40,We stayed in apartment 12 for 4 nights during our stay in puerto escondido. The apartment is very spacious and can sleep up to 4 people. There is a large kitchen and dining area and a wonderful rooftop terrace with hammocks. The on site cafe serves a great breakfast. There is also a large pool which provided some reprieve from the heat. These apartments are good option if you are keen to stay close to the main surf break.
50,"We’re spending 7 nights at Casa de Dan in room 11. After reading its poor review I was hesitant to book it, but my husband and I are very pleased with our accommodations. It’s quite large, with a double bed and a single bed at opposite ends. There's a fully equipped kitchen and the unit is new and everything is extra clean. Dan’s room charges are reasonable, too.The room has two windows (with non-see through curtains) that do front the street, but it’s a quiet alleyway and there’s no problem with anyone gawking through the windows. Being on the “lower level” has the benefit of coolness and the two overhead fans work well. All's well in Dan's Paradise!"
20,"This review is a little longer than normal for me, but I felt the length was needed for me to portray the situation we encountered. Dan’s place has many nicely situated rooms.The one we got was not one of them. When we checked in Dan was very friendly and welcoming. He showed us around but kept asking questions like “Is everything OK?” I wondered what this was about. We found out the first night. Room 11 is badly located. Two windows front the street. The curtains need to be closed for privacy as the windows are at street level. The very small windows on the other side open to a closed in patio - in other words, no air circulation. After the first night we located other accommodation. I felt obligated to let Dan know why we were moving after just two nights of a one week"
40,"Casa Dan was great, affordable, and good location, I was taking Spanish medical classes and surfing daily! Dan was quite friendly, and so were the ladies at the restaurant, which I made good friends with!"
40,"My partner & I checked in late one evening after a long bus drive from Oaxaca City - we were met by Dan.  He showed us to room #7 & gave us some quick details about the hotel & local area.  The room was very clean & spacious with mosquito tight netting on the windows to keep the bugs out.  The kitchen was perfect, with all the ammenities we needed to cook through the week.  I immediately took notice of the huge private patio deck we had overlooking the ocean.  We spent every morning making breakfast & enjoying it on the deck & watching the sunset from there.  It was just perfect!  The pool was a great place to cool off & sit next to with a book from the little library located in the front office.  The hotel has a great breakfast & lunch cafe & is within walking distance to lots"
50,"I've been here with a friend, only for 2 nights. The hotel is very well located and it's very confortable and clean. They have a small cafeteria/restaurant in that is very good too. I'll recomend it to everyone."
50,"The staff at Dan's couldn't have been friendlier. It was the only accommodation in Puerto that even bothered to reply to our email enquiry and when we arrived first thing in the morning fresh from the night bus they looked after our bags and our room was ready well before check in and found space for us when we wanted to stay another night. The owners let us use the facilities for free and stored our bags in their house on our last day as we had a late bus out of town, whereas a lot of other places charge. As it's just off the main drag, the prices are great value for money and it feels really quiet, but you can just walk down the road to all the bars and restaurants if you want a night out, or cook in your cabana if you prefer. The on-site cafe, Dan's Deluxe, really does do the"
50,"I've been to Dan's several times now, and it's the best place I've stayed in Puerto by far. The staff are all great. They're also great about hooking you up with a room within you budget, but at the same time every room is amazing. The observation deck is a great place for surf checks, and just for evening relaxing with a beer or two. The food is good, the location is nice in that it's not right on the playa (but pretty damn close) so it's quiet at night, they have pool, Dan will give you a whooping at ping-pong, and they have some of the best surfers in the world staying there pretty frequently- the Long brothers spring to mind for starters. Dan also knows Puerto very well, and will give you local knowledge on dos and don'ts as far as the town goes.   Five stars, one of the"
50,My wife and enjoyed anther great holiday a Casa Dans we have stayed there several years but #7 was the best one so far! Great view and always good breeze.cooked a lot of meals in our room but when you get tired of that dans deluxe is only a few steps away
50,"I have just spent 3 days at Suites La Hacienda, and thoroughly enjoyed the peace and quiet of this haven set amongst a huge and delightful garden which seems to contain every known species of plant, flower, bush and tropical tree. Owner Bernadette has personally created this treasure, and tends to it devotedly..... The hotel pool is large and inviting, tables and recliners occupying spaces in garden shade and sun (your preference). Furnishings in suites and reception area reflect the excellent taste of Bernadette, and I was put in mind of French colonialism.  Nothing was too much trouble for Bernadette and Clara to ensure that guests were made to feel at home, and I would not think of staying elsewhere on return visits to Puerto Escondido."
50,"And by finer things I mean quietness, zero stress and quality time with your familiy. If you enjoy the beauty and passion of a work of art, this place is for you. It's the best place to relax and forget about the rest of the world or to enjoy a good book by the pool. The Joie de vivre, and excelent taste  of her creator and owner is utterly amazing. It's more like the home you would like to have on the beach than a hotel. The attention to every detail makes it perfect. It has french style, german execution and mexican warmth. Everything here is stone, water, wood, metal, glass, fabric  or ceramic, it's fee of ugly and polluting plastic, and that is a very rare thing nowadays."
50,"My wife Tanya, my baby boy Stefan (2 years old), and I enjoyed a very relaxing 3 week vacation at Suites La Hacienda during January and February this year 2014. Bernadette (the owner) and Clara (her friend and assistant) very graciously arranged a ground-floor suite for us because we wanted to minimize risks for Stefan. When Stefan learned how to open the door to let himself out, Bernadette arranged for a child-proof latch to be installed. These are examples of the little details that make the place so special.  The suite was perfect. It enjoyed some good shade and was never too hot. The kitchen was of ample size, with a dining room that doubled as a second bedroom. The bathroom always had hot water, and the main bedroom was dominated by a lovely French-style four poster bed."
50,"We stayed here for almost three weeks and enjoyed it.  We stayed out of the gossip and apparent disagreements that are happening at this little hotel, which aren't that out of place when people stay for months at a time.   We loved the location, which is a short walk to a main boulevard where there's plenty of restaurants, a movie theatre (in english) and several beaches.  It's a little further to the bank machines, mercado and the shopping market.  It's in a neighbourhood that seems to be primarily occupied by expats, and there's a huge expat community in the area.  It's worth exploring the different areas of Puerto Escondido as they are all different, particularly the beach areas. The suites have kitchen suites, which allow you to cook your own food.  We stayed in suite 10,"
50,"Year after year, La Hacienda remains my favorite place in town. Comfortable and affordable, quiet luxury a short walk from all the facilities, the beach and the market alike, far enough from the commotion of the night life, but just a short hop from your favorite restaurant on the beach! Can't beat it! And Lady Bernadette, the classiest Host in Puerto, always makes you feel at home in her immaculate garden that surrounds the refreshing pool! I'll be back!"
50,"We arrived early on the overnight bus from Oaxaca city and the owner was kind of enough to let us check in at 9:00am.  Our suite are very spacious and beautifully decorated with lots of charming accents including full size french doors that open to the pool/garden area. The master bedroom had a ceiling fan as well as air conditioning and the kitchen was sufficient for cooking meals if so desired.  The pool area is an oasis for relaxation, with a plethora of exotic flowering plants, comfortable furniture, and relaxing music.  This is a small boutique hotel with maybe a dozen suites and while there we met some very friendly people who return to this place year after year. The hotel is very clean inside and out and includes maid service. The owner is a French woman named Bernadette"
50,"We stayed at Suites La Hacienda for a little less than a week at the end of October. In Puerto Escondido it's probably one of a kind. It's clean, classy, not crowded and beautifully decorated. This is not the typical backpackers place, bit more of a boutique hotel. The place is run by two ladies: Bernadette (French) and Clara (Mexican who speaks French and English extremely well). They are a great team and will sort you out. I was here with my girlfriend, we loved it. It was a perfect place from which to discover Puerto Escondido, with more luxury than one typically finds in this amazing town. We loved Puerto Escondido and having seen many hotels here, were extremely happy with our choice.We had room number 1, which I would always take. There is no breakfast in Suites La"
50,"We have stayed in a number of different accommodations in Puerto Escondido. None can compare to Suites La Hacienda. The rooms are decorated beautifully and are fully equipped with everything you might need for an extended stay, and that is saying something in PE as most lodgings are sparsly equipped.  The grounds are impeccably maintained and to sit by the pool is to sit in a lush sub-tropical oasis.  Bernadette and her staff could not be more attentive and friendly."
50,"Just 8 rooms on a hacienda style property with lush colorful gardens, terrace and a big pool. The rooms are all suites that have a spacious bedroom, bathroom and a kitchen/comedor. All very quiet and laidback. There is no restaurant service but several restaurants are just a 5 minutes’ walk toward the beach for have breakfast. Or yiu just buy your own stuff to cook in the kitchen. All very quiet and walking distance from the beach. The French owner, Bernadette, is very kind and helpful and is around all day to help you with anything you might need. This is a perfect place for a long stay or just for a few days. Wireless and cable tv in the rooms."
50,"This is like home away from home! The charming owner Bernadette and her cheerful staff make every second of your stay memorable! Pristine gardens, crystal clear and clean pool, spacious apartments, quiet surroundings yet minutes away from the market or the beach... well worth checking!..."
10,"So my shoulder came out its socket in my sleep, 2 of the guys there were super nice and helped me get to the hospital, but one of the main managers there said that if I didn't calm down he'd kick me out on the street and said he wouldn't help get an ambulance or taxi because he didn't want to get involved with medical emergencies because it could lead to customer complaints. He was also the only one present who could speak spanish so it would have been a help. What kind of service threatens to kick an injured guest out instead of just taking 5-10 minutes to help get a taxi?"
50,"Revisiting Puerto Escondido and never had any doubts on where I would stay. The hostel offers great facilities and atmosphere for the best price in the area. 3 well stocked kitchens, comfortable beds, drinking water, friendly staff and volunteers and just the best location. Big shout out to Nelsan 💕"
10,Awful experience and very unprofessional. Be wary and save yourself a headache and book elsewhere. Management was incredibly rude and disrespectful and have shady business practices including false advertising.
10,"Horrible place, dirty, dangerous because of the installations. The ''rooms'' are actually cages made of wood pieces without windows or even door locks. We couldn't sleep at all because of noises and awful beds. + cold people."
50,"probably one of the best hostels I've stayed in, (seasoned traveller of 20yrs) not fancy but amazing value in a top location...great vibes and super friendly staff. places like this attract the best people...i have met some amazing ones here. having a kitchen makes things really easy having dietary issues  Will definitely be back❤"
40,"I occupy one of the two-bed, private-patio with kitchen suites and I am very happy here, but even when I was in a single room waiting for this suite to become available, I was pretty happy with the shared kitchen and huge patio overlooking Zicatela beach. So cheap, it leaves you lots of money to slip over the road to Chedraui and get whatever you need. The beach is a 20 minute walk, but I seldom go there because I love our pool here in which I do my daily exercises recovering from a hip replacement. The staff are friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. The building is aging, but has a real Mexican flair. The only drawback is the traffic noise from the highway right below, but I guess this why the cost is so reasonable. I love it here."
10,Servicio deficiente. Habitaciones sucias y olor desagradable. Baños muy viejos. Costo muy elevado para el servicio e instalaciones. FACTURACION malísima. La encargada de facturar no quiere tener el trabajo de cancelar y de facturar. Los encargados en ningún momento dan la cara y solo el recepcionista con respuestas sin sentido. En general servicio malo y malas instalaciones
50,"Hotel muy familiar,  perfecto para descansar y a precios muy accesibles, recomendado 100% para la familia.  Está muy cerca del aeropuerto y tiene mucho estacionamiento. La cafetería del hotel está súper agradable, lea recomiendo las hamburguesas de camarón!!  Son deliciosas!!!"
20,"Estoy de acuerdo que en temporada alta los precios suben, pero pagar un precio alto por una habitación mala? Las habitaciones son viejas, el baño muy anticuado, solo 3 canales de tv (televisión abierta) en fin, no muy recomendable..."
50,Ate at the restaurant various times the past 2 weeks and really enjoyed it. Perfect place for some beer or wine and a nice dinner after a day at the beach. Food is inventive yet comforting with a French twist. Great flavor and great value. Highly recommend. 
50,"Just wrapping up a 6 day stay at this amazing hostel.  The food here is absolutely amazing, they have a great staff and a full bar.  Very easy to meet people and fill your day with activities. The terrace is a great spot to chill and watch the sunset or read a book.  I traveled solo, but with come back again both myself or with my partner."
50,"We booked One Love at the last minute right after Christmas.  It was the most awesome place!!  The rooms were fantastic....we stayed in the ""Lennon"" room while our teenage daughter stayed in one of the dorms. I loved the bathroom in our room with its artistic flare. We met so many great people traveling too.  The upstairs terrace was awesome for relaxing and sunsets.  It had an abundance of hammocks and a great view of the ocean.  The restaurant on the premises served some of the best food around!  Our hostess, Lorien, was wonderful and was there to accommodate us whenever we needed a cab or when we locked our keys in our room.  Zicatela beach was just steps away and Punta....major surf beach and town, was within easy walking distance. The friendliness of the staff and the"
50,"One Love Hostal is one of the most beautiful places I stayed in Mexico! The rooms and the dorms are so nice that you wouldn't believe it to be so cheap!!! The food is amazing, all organic, and diversed to satisfy any taste!! The zicatela beach is right in front (1 minute walk) and is perfect for surfing! The people working there are friendly and helpful...Super Cool Spot!! "
50,We went to have a few drinks & lucked out with live music :)  The pizza is absolutely delicious; I would eat it all the time if possible! The staff was fun & friendly.  Overall a cool & relaxed vibe with impressive food.
50,"Great place, Great food!!! The staff is super nice and friendly, and the hotel offers everything you need, internet, beach view terrace, surf boards, kitchen, restaurant, laundry service etc... It's close to everything, but far enough of the noise at night, so you can sleep perfectly. Rooms are extra clean with private bathroom, just perfect. Very cheap for a great quality!!! ;)"
50,"We booked for 2 nights and ended up staying one week, the place is just perfect for relaxing on the huge terraza on one of the many hammocks, great ocean view and the cool breeze just makes it all better. The food of the restaurant is tasty and healthy, the rooms clean and nicely decorated. The staff super friendly and we loved the fact that the place is not on Zicatela much more quiet to rest and the beach is just 2 min away. We loved everything... we'll come back for sure!"
50,"We vacationed in Pto Escondido numerous times and like a good wine, the place gets better with every passing year (or maybe it is just our subjective opinion?).  In particular, our most recent three winters ('09, '10, '11 - a total of  about 10 months) were especially memorable due to our choice of the accommodations: Las Turquezas.  The condos were still under construction, when we saw the building for the first time in 2008 - and we could recognise that it was a jewel in the making.  We decided that this was going to be ‘our nest’ in Puerto from now on.    And so it is our pleasure to share our impressions of Las Turquezas:  THE LOCATION: in the residential and not very ‘touristy’ area of town, high above the water, allowing great views of lush greenery in the foreground,  and"
50,My husband and I had the pleasure of stumbling upon Vicki's Zicatela Suites in passing. We enjoyed it so much we never wanted to leave. The view is absolutely incredible and the location is practically on the beach and just a 5 minute or less walk to the center of Zicatela's restaurants and gift shops. My husband woke up every morning and walked across the beach for incredible surf while I was able to watch from the terrace while sipping coffee!! Vicki and her staff were very attentive and helpful with a wonderful guide made up of restaurants and activities. The pool was refreshing and the entire site and suites were immaculate. We can't wait to go back!!!
50,"I Had the pleasure of staying at Vicki's for an Amazing extended stay.  The apartments themselves are clean, large, and spacious. The bedroom had excellent aircon, with a balcony running off it from which to check the surf. The pool was nice and clean having temp after surfing for a couple of hours in the warm Mexican ocean most days. Vicki was always nearby if I had any concerns/ questions and I felt very safe staying at Zicatela suites. Cheers Vicki"
50,"Sparkling clean, modern, new, comfortable bed, hot water in the shower, fully equipped kitchen,  AC, pool, wifi, private porch overlooking the ocean... what more could you ask for? It's a whole apartment. The kitchen has a good stove, microwave, coffeemaker, and toaster. Vicky, the owner, is friendly and helpful. The location is great, close to the beach and in a quieter spot than the hotels in the main Zicatela commercial area a few blocks away, but still walking distances to cafes, stores, laundromat, yoga classes, and restaurants."
50,"Prior reviewers have done an excellent job of outlining the many pluses of the suites.  We stayed a week at Zicatela Suites and every review is spot on.  Our two cents: as long time visitors to Mexico we have many tales of ""unique"" features in accommdations we have rented.  In Todos Santos, Baja Mexico, the light switch for the bathroom was in the shower stall---We took very short showers in the dark!!!   The suites suffer from no such shortcomings.  Vicki Cole, the owner, made sure the suites were well planned, well built and are well managed.  From the moment you step inside the gate you get north of the border building standards with an abundance of Mexican charm."
50,"This was the perfect spot to relax, walk on the beach and go to the gym. I have been coming to Puerto for 18yrs and Zicatela Suites was the perfect place. Beautilful  with everything included  to have a perfect vacation. Relax on the balcony and enjoy the view of the ocean or just lay back and read by the pool. We have our reservations for 2014."
50,"I am a friend of Vicki Cole, the owner of this property and I stay in one of her three equally beautiful apartments when I visit Zicatela, but even though we are friends, I'm sincerely not being biased when I say that a lot of love, excellent design and attention to detail and comfort went into creating these brand new spacious apartments.  I like to cook so I fully appreciate that all the essentials are there including a blender which I wasn't expecting. In addition, the television is not limited to Spanish speaking programs, all the windows and doors have mosquito screens, the beds are very comfortable, the bathrooms are beautiful, with hand painted ceramic sinks and hand painted Mexican tiles mixed with pebble designs above the counters and in the shower, the towels are big"
50,"We spent a week in Puerto Escondido in early March and really loved staying at Zicatela Suites. It is perfectly located right across from the beach and only a couple of mins walk into the centre of the town. We had the one bedroom apartment on the top floor, it was so nice to stay somewhere that was spacious, clean and has everything you need. Vicky, the owner, was so helpful in helping us with restaurant recommendations, day trips, organising taxis. We hope to come back sometime!"
50,"Like other reviewers I have been coming to Puerto Escondido for many years.  I thought the other two places I have stayed were great but Zicatela Suites tops them all.  For a month I sat on the patio reading interspersed with swims in the lovely pool, walks on the beach that is just across the street and short walks to the business district of Zicatela.  The one bedroom suites are roomy up to date, clean and have lovely cross breezes.  I did not use the AC even once because of the ocean breezes.  Vickie, the owner, is available and helpful and maintains a comfortable and beautiful property.  I think this is the best in Puerto for rentals.  I will be back, but make reservations early as this place will fill up quickly."
50,"If you're with us and hate hotel rooms, want the comfort of home, but still want the convenience of location and spectacular views of sunset on the beach, then Vicki's Zicatela Suites is for you.  These new, spacious 1-bedroom apartments have air-conditioned bedrooms, large bathrooms, a full kitchen, dinette,  spacious living rooms, and balconies.  There's also a small swimming pool (great for cooling off), and the 4th floor common area with a large palapa, perfect for sipping pina coladas and enjoying the sunset (see photo).  Vicki was such a wonderful host to us--we felt we had made a real friend."
50,Zicatela Suites is by far the best accomendation in Puerto Escondido! Vicki the owner does a wonderful job making your vacation comfortable and relaxing. The apartments are new and have a ocean view and are decorated beautifully. Very clean and quiet and a perfect location.                                      Thank You Vicki for a perfect vacation!                                                                John and Connie Faryna
40,"This hotel is located perfectly on one end of the famous Zicatela beach (and what an awesome beach). It's quite a large hotel - but doesn't feel that way because of all the twists & turns, multiple levels & pools. Feels like living in a tropical garden - very well maintained. The rooms - especially the bathrooms - are a bit dated/well-used - but not enough to cause any trouble, unless you're a spoiled brat. They're clean & roomy, and the mattress was very good. No party or other noises during the night so we awoke every morning feeling great. The restaurant in this hotel really deserves mentioning. The quality of all three meals and the service was excellent. Also a superb view of the whole length of the beach (must be 3km or more stretch). In the evening you can sit on the"
20,"The hotel is tired and in need of an update the beds were terrible, very uncomfortable, their website posts a free breakfast but the hotel says they don't.  The room rate is much higher than what is posted online."
50,Ten of us traveled to Puerto Escondido in June and stayed at the Hotel Santa Fe. The location was perfect because several of the guys wanted to surf Zicatela where the waves are enormous. The hotel and service were excellent and the location was near shopping and cafes. We enjoyed our trip and I've recently thought of returning with another group.
40,"We stayed here for about 5 days and enjoyed it very much.  The room was large and clean.  There was an in-room safe, free wi-fi.  Prices are quite reasonable.  The hotel's restaurant is excellent -- open air with a view of the beach.  I am a vegetarian, so I was very pleased to find a full page of vegetarian options.  They also had lots of seafood entrees, but little or no beef.  There are two pools, so room to spread out."
50,"This hotel is so lovely. It is right on the ocean and you can sit on the patio, or having breakfast looking beyond the bougainvillea at the warm salty ocean. Comfortable beds, great service and terrific food."
40,"This is a good choice for couples and families looking for a nice hotel in Puerto Esc because: 1) the rooms, pool, restaurant are attractive, in good condition and maintained very clean, 2) the staff is very friendly and efficient, 3) the AC in the rooms is modern, quiet and effective, 4) it is close to the restaurants and shopping, but not too close. I have slept on more comfortable beds and you might want to bring your own pillow. "
50,"I loved our time at Hotel Santa Fe. It has two pools, on different levels of the terraced garden, so you can choose the one whose shade (or lack) works best for you at the time.   There is a wonderful view of the beach from the terrace and the bar / restaurant, and it's a lovely place to watch the sun go down. Also: best margarita I tasted in Puerto Escondido / Playa Zicatela - and I tasted A LOT.   We had dinner and breakfast in the hotel on one occasion each, and both were superb. The chef's recommended seafood pasta was cooked to perfection for dinner, and did I mention the margaritas...?  Everything in Playa Zicatela is an easy walk from here, and we did it several times at night in the dark with no issues.   The Adoquín of Puerto Escondido also isn't far, and we walked it a"
40,"My husband and I just at Hotel Santa Fe for 3 nights (Tues-Sat) in early October. We flew in from Mexico City. It was rainy season but the weather was glorious--started to rain just after sunset all 3 nights. The hotel is really nice. Very cute and clean. Plenty of places (lounge chairs and eating areas) to sit by the two pools. The terrace has a beautiful view of the Zicatela Beach. Loved that the hotel is walking distance to a bunch of restaurants on the beach (get the coco fish and Coco Fish restaurant), a cafe (Cafetal has great cortados) and a corner grocery store. The hotel also has a restaurant with yummy breakfasts. Not too impressed by the lunch and dinner at the hotel restaurant--also pretty expensive.  Stayed in the ""Standard Double Room"" w/ a huge king size bed. It"
50,I had a delicious bowl of Sopa de Azteca with some fresh brown bread and a cold & super quenching limonata. The place is right across the street from the statue of the hands on the North end of Zicatela beach. I saw beautiful breakfasts being served and they had a good looking menu as well. The staff were very efficient and welcoming & the kitchen looked super clean. Definitely a must to try. The hotel grounds are beautiful & I saw they have a Spa there too.
50,"We had been at this hotel 10 years ago and thought it to be a hidden gem. We were worried that in 10 years time our fond recollections would be smaashed. No need to worry! Still a great little hotel ( though larger than 10 years ago). There are 3 pools and an incredible terrace that faces the ocean with great views. The restaurant is clearly above average and also offers great views of the ocean and sunsets. I loved the appetizer of shrimp tacos. The beach is right across the street. The place is the perfect place to relax as rooms are large and comfortable and there are lounge chairs at all the pools and on the terrace. Loved Puerto Escondido and in 10 years, though a bit larger, has not lost its charm."
30,"El hotel es regular ya que aunque la ropa de cama está limpia el baño aunque limpio también está bastante descuidado, el cuarto que me quede tenia la coladera rota y la taza con manchas por fuera, destaca la amabilidad me imagino que es la dueña la que te atiende en recepción y de su hijo en la tienda al lado, muy buen wifi, el ventilador casi insuficiente para el clima, mi habitación tenia un frigobar pero bastante descuidado. Su ubicación es buena."
50,"Отель находится в 3 минутах ходьбы от пляжа Маринеро! На пляже есть умеренные волны, на которых очень здорово скакать и не бояться, что тебя утащит в океан. За отдельную плату на пляже можно взять лежак и зонитк. До популярного серферского пляжа Зикателло по береговой линии идти минут 10. Для кого-то отель находится в глуши, но я наслаждалась, так как здесь было тихо и малолюдно.  Номер был уютный и хороший, хоть и маленький. В номере есть душ и ловит вай-фай. Много иностранцев в отеле, почему-то мне встречались французы.   Отличное соотношение цены-качества, если вам не надо шума, тусовок и серферских волн, а нужно побыть с собой, поплавать с удовольствием в теплом океане и высыпаться."
20,"La posizione dell hotel va benissimo. Rapporto qualità prezzo è normale, potrebbero dare una sistemata e una verniciata alle camere più che altro. Pieno di cucarache considerando che noi eravamo a piano terra, una disinfettata sarebbe utile. X chi non vuole spendere molto è ok"
30,Albergo molto semplice! Non propio il massimo della pulizia ma puo andare! Ho visto anche di peggio!Ottima posizione tra spiaggia e centro! Camere molto semplice ma essenziali! Una sufficenza gli si da!
30,"Nice place with nice owners. Typical hostal style with bar and restaurant. The restaurant serves good vegetarian food. The wooden cabañas are very basic but clean. Only that they are very close together therefore you can hear every single word from the neightbors. It's very hot inside, we could'nt find any sleep, but since the party was going on almost all night long there was anyway not sleep. The location is close to the beach and aprox. 2 kms away from main part of Playa Zicatela (Bars & Restaurants). We move to another place because it was to isolated for us and we wanted to get some sleep."
50,"This place is cool. It is a clean, inexpensive, personable, fun place to be & stay. The food is vegetarian & excellent; it is creative, and lovingly prepared. Osa takes pride in all aspects of what it offers. Even if you are staying elsewhere in Puerto Escondido, you will want to spend time hanging out at Osa Mariposa. The people at Osa are genuinely caring people, lead interesting lives, and have lots of good energy to share. Besides the food & laid-back atmosphere, they also have a great bar -- and the drinks are fab!"
50,"This is a great, clean, simple, fun, beautiful location, affordable hostel, yummy vegetarian food, great mezcal drink kinda place! Staff is always friendly and helpful- fun to party with too! Food is always homemade and delicious. Rooms are constantly cleaned and quite primitive ( bed, mosquito net, fan, lights) but what more do you really need on a beach? Location is everything. Located in a quieter part of town but just close enough to all the action :) showers and bathrooms are located in the front part of the hostel and always clean. There's lots of musicians that come through there often so you can be sure to hear live music on beautiful warm nights :) anyhow- there's not enough words to express how awesome this place is and how you re sure to leave there with some great"
50,"Quaint, intimate..perfect blend of relax time and party play time. Awesome staff, clean, comfortable, delicious home cooked veggie meals mmmm.  The bar has a great selection and there is always good music, even live musical performances and jams. I loved the location just outside of main tourist area but so easily accessed and in between two great surf spots. The gardens and courtyard are beautiful. The whole atmosphere is warm, inviting and friendly..oh and I have to mention, its a great place to meet people..I met my husband there! I miss it and cant wait to go back!!"
50,Osa is a beautiful little spot so close to the ocean you can hear the wave at night. It's a great place to meet travelers from all over the world and have great conversations over mezcal y cervezas. Great food and great company.
50,"Osa Mariposa Hotelito is one of the most unique places I have ever stayed. Not only is the food amazing but the people and place its self is too!! It's beautiful and quiet but still has a bit of a party feel to it. They are always playing great music on the stereo, always ready to have a good conversation or play some awesome card games with you. You can walk to the beach in about 3 minutes, its that close to the ocean. You can hear the waves from your room. The place is just down right beautiful.   The wonderful people that run Osa make you feel like your a part of there family and when you leave they will be! You will never forget them or the wonderful place they have made their.  With love, Marie Litton"
50,"I went to osa mariposa because of the vegan restaurant.  It was difficult finding food in mexico that i could eat.  I loved the hotel and the staff (especially Dave) their care and kindness make you feel at home right away.  After a few days I had the perfect hammock rotation down so I could get optimal sun in the courtyard. I loved teh food and the friends I made there.  It was an amazing place, steps to the ocean and a short walk to the surf beach.  Definitely worth checking out!!!!"
50,"Walking distance to the best waves in Latin America, cheap, clean, and great service.  Parties are great, but you can also relax at the hamacs while you drink a beer. Great place to meet Interesting people from all around the world. VERY safe, and I'm sure I'll be back as soon as possible"
50,"We have never stayed in Osa Mariposa, but we eat there regularly when we are in Puerto Escondido. The Vegan/Vegetarian food is excellent and very economical. The menu is small but all the food is tasty, we particularly like the Black Bean Burger.  Every day they have a different couple of specials, I usually have them, and I'm never disappointed.  The people who work there, a mixture of young Americans and Mexicans, are always friendly and helpful. I have never stayed there, but the rooms look basic but clean, the grounds are well kept, the shared showers and toilets are spotless. Its a less then 5 minute walk to the surf of Playa Zicatela, a little over 10 minutes to the restaurants and shops of La Punta. Its a great place to have dinner, and one of the best places in Puerto"
50,"We found this hostel by accident, although i think it was a destiny!! It was the best hostel i've stayed in Mexico in my one month long trip. We wanted to stay for a night and end up staying 5 nights! Beautiful place, very clean with an amazing atmosphere and people working there! The food they're making was great too! We went out together and spend a great time! The hostel is located in a very quite area, just perfect distance from Puerto Escondido, you can catch this funny small trucks to get there for a little money. It`s also very close (two minutes maybe) to the beach, very wide and empty in november!!! It has been a great time :)"
50,"AMAZING HOSTEL!! Clean, beautiful, friendly, safe, wonderful! Go, go, go!! Only a five or ten minute walk to the beach. Wonderful, friendly family runs the hostel. The breakfasts are great and free. I can't wait to go back!!!"
50,"This hostel is in Puerto Escondido and the beaches are amazing. It's 20 min from the main beach, but very close to the best small beaches. They have a surprising hospitality, good rooms and good swimming pool."
50,"I stayed there with my boyfriend for almost two months, and it was amazing. The hostel is very clean, the rooms are very good, there is a nice swimming pool and the staff is very helpful. The owner, Liz, is very nice, she was always organizing events for the guests. If you go to Puerto Escondido, don't think twice and stay in Losodeli, it's the best place you'll find there."
50,Loved this HOSTAL. Owned by a super friendly family who are extremely warm and pleasant. Close to the beaches and restaurants. Pool. Clean rooms. Comfortable beds. Great mix if peopke saying there: families as well as backpackers. Would definitely recommend this HOSTAL.
50,"The hostel is perfectly located, clean and a awesome place to be. A mexican family from puerto owns the hostel is doing everything so you feel good and safe. You can make awesome trips organized by the hostel, learn surfing and going by a walk to all nice places in Puerto. In the evenings they offer the best mojitos in Puerto ever and you can go out with other guests to make party, eating or just to be together and have a good time! Finally it has the best prices and services (6er dorm for 130$ incl. breakfast!!!) in Puerto! Enjoy :)"
50,Great place to relax or party.Zicatelli party strip five minutes away.Several different beaches close by & surf beaches..Heaps of restuarants local food or variety Falafel shop Italian pizza..And relax by the pool if you desire.
50,"My stay at Hostal Losodeli was incredible. The staff are all friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and the atmosphere is fun and laid back. I spoke no Spanish when I arrived, and they accommodated for that wonderfully. I was travelling alone, so they were always inviting me out and including me in whatever events were going on.  When my wallet got stolen they helped me set up a bank account in Mexico. So genuinely kind and hospitable! Hostal losodeli is walking distance from all the beaches, or a short cab ride. It's also close to the market as well as the superche. To top it off it's inexpensive. I would 100% recommend it to my friends and family, and will stay there again if I go back to puerto. "
50,The Losodeli is a wonderful hostel. It´s very clean and the owner is very nice. Everytime we went there she would give us a ride to the airport or busstation when we left. The atmosphere is amazing. Everybody is really relaxed. A wonderful beach is just a 10-minutes-walk away.
50,"Perfect place to stay if travelling alone. Easy to meet people in the communal areas - by the pool, kitchen etc. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Activities were organised for some evenings e.g. BBQ for paddy's day and trip to see baby turtles being released and cinema on the beach. walking distance to market for breakfast and can walk to the beach for a swim. Would definitely recommend it!"
30,"This hostel is ok. It might depend on the room in which you stay and the time of year. My friend and I stayed in the female dorm for three nights in July of 2013.  THE FEMALE DORM: The floor was sandy the entire time and no one came to clean. The entire room has only one fan (that makes a horrible noise) and is constantly set to oscillate. You can turn the fan off, but then it is impossible to even lie in bed because it is too hot and humid. (I'm from Florida)  THE BEDS: The beds were child size (I'm a small female so it was ok for me, but my taller friend's feet hung over the end) and they were really rickety. The ladder for the bunk seemed like it would fall apart at any moment. But what actually hurt, were the bed slats coming through the super-thin mattress.   THE VIBE: This"
10,"dirty old hostel, dorms are hot like hell & without good ventilation get used to the gang of hobos hanging around and a lot of sketchy guys coming in going out with small little plastic bags loud music almost 24/7"
20,"Not the best place in town... loud and far from everything. Puerto is full of nice little hostels, so if you're not 19 years old and want to sleep at night, you should find an other place to stay. Puerto is great, you should go."
10,"Firstly, that photo is not of this hostel.   The rooms are among the dirtiest I have seen in 10 months in Latin America. Old toothpaste stains on the sink in our room, we had to ask 3 times for bed sheets, no fan or air con and the ""service"" is non existent! Not to mention the crazy woman they let stay, commonly known to be a drug dealer.   Do yourself a favour, walk 30 seconds down to the left, pay 20 pesos less and have a great stay at Pakololo "
40,"We had two different rooms here. Our first night the room was at the back of the hostel which got all the noise from the nightly party on the roof terrace. We moved to a front room with a balcony. It was nice. There is a lot of noise. The bar on the next street has really loud live entertainment so the noise in the hostel makes no difference. It didn't bother us but does go on until about 2am almost every night. There is a great kitchen, lots of common space and seating and it's comfortable. It is a party hostel but you don't have to party! You can walk to a couple of beaches and there is a fantastic supermarket close by across from the bus station. Wifi was good and there was a tv with loads of channels in the room. We had a great stay."
10,"I stayed at the Mayflower and firstly; believe the hype. It's a reasonable stay with great comfort, reliable fridges and it's walking distance to the beach. The second time I went to Escondido, I stayed much further down at the southern point. WELL WELL WORTH EXPLORING. I ended up in a gorgeous beach hut. But hey, all the youngsters are at the Mayflower. I met a person who became one of my closest friends there."
40,We have stayed at both Oaxaca/Pto. Escondito Hostals .   They are well located for the towns they are in.  Both are clean and nice helpful people run them. English is spoken and they can set up tours at both of these. The one in Oaxaca is right next to a  lovely park and good resurants and about 6 blocks from the Zocalo. The hostal in Pto. Escondito is only 2 blocks from the waterfront and right on the main drag on the town. Both can be a little nosy but not bad.
50,"I was recently in Puerto Escondido for seven weeks, doing some business and Spanish school with some surfing on the side and I chose to stay at the Hotel Mayflower for the entire time. It offers a very favorable central location and is only half a block away from the main beach. I could walk everywhere I needed to go: beaches, school, groceries (the main store is only two blocks away); except for late night partying on Zicatela and surfing out at La Punta. Minne, the proprietor, has a wealth of knowledge about Puerto and can tell you anything you want to know about the place in a heartbeat. The hotel has a great atmosphere with friendly staff, it is kept really fresh and clean and is tastefully decorated with art and tropical plants. It is designed really well with places to"
50,"good facilities kitchen, restroom pool/bar, bath-wc hole- day clean, reception Esp. and Eng. spoken. handy central, to every part of area, 5min to center of city/ bus terminal/ Big grosserie store. 2 min to beach/ beach shopping street"
40,"Well the title says it all, it was my third time at Mayflower and I had a great time. The staff are extremely friendly and polite, and the room was immaculately clean as per usual. I love this place not just because its close to everything I want, but because the general atmosphere of the place is just so warm and friendly. The lady owner, Minne(sp) is an incredible wealth of information and if you can pin her down she is just lovely to talk to. Overall my favourite place to stay in Mexico!"
30,"overall good service, showers in the dormitories are small, no water pressure and no hot water. private rooms hot water and better pressure. it seems the hotel is doing well enough to remedy these things but hasnt. cabana edda had doubles for much cheaper and are not too far from the beach."
40,"Very handy to find if you are getting the bus to Puerto Escondido. Enjoyed stay here only problem was pool table area was closed at 11pm so you couldnt really stay in and have a few beers nobody wanted that,other then that good hostel,spent many hours hungover in the hamoc!"
20,"Messed up the booking, dirty, stinky sheets, full of roaches and no hot water at all. Just don't stay here....you can get other places with just as good a location for the same money and way better."
40,"The Mayflower is a great place to stay as the prices are good and the rooms are excellent. There are great facilities - full kitchen, billard table, terrace, free internet etc. It is really close to nightlife and the beach of course. The only downside is that there are a few strict rules in place e.g kicking you out of the terrace at 11pm. We had a great time with the other guests too."
50,"Our stay was just amazing, during all my travels, i've never felt so at home as in vivo escondido. It's like a big family. It's so comfortable and in just 5min you are at the beach. A huge thank you to all the staff who made my stay unforgetable"
40,"Went here for only one night. The hostel is located close to Carizallilo beach and just around the corner to a couple of restaurants in Rinconada.   The hostel seem very new and is very clean. The breakfast included consist of batter to make your own pancakes. The beds are probably the most comfortable I've had traveling around in Latin America the past 4 months. Friendly crowd, pretty young though. Super friendly and helpful staff  I would definitely recommend this hostel and go here again. "
50,"Volunteered at this hostel for a month through workaway and couldn't have made a better decision ! The owner is an amazing guy - an American who fell in love with puerto escondido ! Hostel is super laid back and has a pool plus poolside beers ! There are hammocks on the rooftop with a view of the sea .. They help you book tours for dolphin watching .. Surf lessons and also trips for the glowing phytoplankton lagoon ""life of pi"" effect ! Location can't be better with a 10 min walk to the beginner surfer beach playa carrizallello . "
50,"Vivo Escondido was undoubtedly one of the best hostels I've ever stayed at, if not the best. My friends and I (a group of four) booked one night and ended up staying for 2 and a half weeks and would of stayed longer if we didn't have flights booked back to Australia. Vivo felt like a home away from home; it is kept wonderfully clean and has fantastic amenities (pool, table tennis table, numerous hang out areas, great bathrooms and spacious dorms, lovely terrace, the list goes on). The location is unparalleled: a 1 minute walk to Playa Carrizallilo (a beautiful beach) and the main street which has great restaurants and shops. The staff are the loveliest people and take pride in ensuring Vivo runs efficiently, but also making you feel like you have come home at the end of the day."
50,Loved this hostel so much and stayed there  one week!! Very nice chill place with swimming pool and tennis table!! This hostel has a special atmosphere!! The beach is just awalk distance!! And around there many good restaurants! The staff super nice helpful and friendly!! Comfortable beds and everything is super clean!! The kitchen is really good!! Breakfast is included!!  
50,"Fantastic place. I'm 50 and my husband is 57, we didn't feel out of place here even though they were all a lot younger than us. We were made to feel so welcome by staff and other guests. Extremely clean, no loud music or drinking after 11pm, you have to go.into.town if you want to drink after this time.  Would definitely go back to this place. Loads of restaurants within a 2 minute walk. Close to 2 beaches.  Shop that sells cheap beer and provides outdoor seating for.You to.drink.it and watch tv outside, like a cheap bar. Haha. In.  Quiet place, residential.area away from the tourist hotels and shops. Perfect"
50,"Don't think I need to say anything more than the fact that this was the best hotel I've stayed in in Mexico. Location is second to none, beginner's surfing beach is a 10 minute walk away. The staff are terrific for their travel advice and guidance. Met the owner Ross a couple of times, one of the most down to earth individuals I've ever met........He even proceeded to school me in a game of chess one of the nights I was here.  A bar stocked with Indio and Dos Equis is the first thing you see when you come in the gate. Purified water is available in the kitchen and an outdoor pool is just inside the main gates so people can cool off after a hectic surfing or shopping day. Very sociable hostel with everyone getting to know all the other guests and staff. Hammocks are even on the"
50,"Good family atmosphere, unbeatable spot.  Stay here, you are guaranteed to love it.  Dorms Are nice with good new bedding. Pools and rooftop hammocks are especially nice.  Staff is mostly voulenteer workers that are great fun and always there to help.   Also, hit the kebabs and burgers near here.    "
50,"What an amazing place! I stayed here with 2 friends for a few nights, and was sad to have to leave. So sad, that I returned from Puerto Angel a day later to stay for 4 more days after my friends and I parted ways on our journey!  Wonderful artwork adorns the walls, the staff are all so easygoing and friendly, and everything is so well taken care of and clean. It felt more like a home with family than just a temporary place to rest my head.  I will most definitely return and would highly recommend it to anyone. The private suite with bath is where I stayed, and was well worth it for me as I enjoyed the privacy, although the dorms also seemed quite lovely and I wouldn't hesitate to stay in any of them either. Kitchen was always clean, and the free self-serve pancake and coffee"
50,"We were so lucky to end up at this hostel. The owner Ross is an absolute legend and will go out of his way to help you. This hostel seemed to attract a good crowd of people. The artwork throughout this O.C style mansion is amazing. The pool was a savior in the scorching heat. They also have a ping pong table, chess board and all the good stuff. The morning pancakes were also a treat. Close distance to some local shops. Ross also had plans to make the hostel even better. Thanks for the good times mate!!!!! Out of all the hostels, this one was my favourite."
30,"After having spent the last few months in Huatulco, thought a few days in Puerto Escondido might be a nice change. All accounts raved about Casa Dan's. Thought we'd give it a try. Service was nice enough, but quite frankly the upstairs room(#9) was quite rustic, didn't give you that ""WOW"" feeling one might expect when it came to cleanliness. The view is great, but the hammocks felt oily and dirty. The kitchen had cheap, poorly outfitted utensils. The pool---murky. It felt ""old"".....like walking into a place where no one really cared whether you stayed here or not. We left. For just a few dollars more we found an extremely clean, well appointed unit close by. Same view, well appointed kitchen, in fact well appointed everything ---it was a ""no brainer"". So would I recommend Casa"
50,"My aprtner and I stayed in room 7, which had a breath taking view. The room was large and the kitchen had everythign we needed. We made many meals there but we also had breakfast in Dan's Cafe, which is also worth checking out. Dan and the rest of the staff were knowledgable about the are and very hospitable. I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
50,"My partner and I stayed at Dan's for five weeks and absolutely fell in love with the place, location, staff and steady stream of returning guests. Dan’s really is a special little oasis and I truly feel that our experience of Puerto would have been vastly different had we stayed elsewhere.  We actually decided to arrive a week early and so our first week was spent in one of the cheaper rooms, Number 11.  While this is a decent budget option it wasn't a patch on the apartment we spent four weeks in – Number 9. Number 9 is the “penthouse” suite with stunning views up and down Zicatela beach and the communal rooftop deck (with the best views of Zicatela in Puerto)  directly out front.   The communal deck has a steady stream of visitors through the day (mostly during the very early"
50,"We stayed at Dans for 11 nights in one of the cabanas and it was just amazing in every way. The place is a collection of cabanas and apartments and are spread out around the grounds so that every apartment feels very private. The location is great, only a few minutes from town and you get amazing views across Zicatela. The staff are wonderful - Dan, the owner, is friendly and always willing to chat and give great advice, and the rest are always helpful and lovely. Dan's Cafe has the best breakfasts in town for the best value and makes delicious fish tacos in the weekends. Book well in advance as this place is very popular - it was our favorite place in our entire four months of travelling and I would highly recommend it to anyone coming to Puerto Escondido!"
50,"The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms very clean and completely furnished, with kitchenette fridge and water heater. Close to calle Morro (Zicatela beach) and a  short bus/car drive from Adoquin and Center Puerto Escondido. Great atmosphere and guest from all over the world."
50,"Dans is a great place to stay. Very popular with surfers & Travelers so it sells out fast. Make sure you get a room with a view, book early. Food here is very good."
50,"I stayed at Casa de Dan, during a welcome vacation from teaching English in Mexico. Walking into Casa de Dan's a huge smile spread across my face, it was like walking into a little oasis. The whole place was beautiful with amazing plants and flowers lining the walkways and a relaxed, homely, friendly atmosphere. We stayed in Cabana number 2 and it was brilliant. The cabana was large, comfortable, and had the best hammock I had experienced while out in Mexico....which is an important thing. The cabana also had a kitchen area which was ideal! The pool was perfect for a dip to cool down in the heat of the day and there were the best views of the waves of Zicatela from the roof terrace, again very important! Dan's cafe was a fabulous way to start the day with an amazing breakfast"
50,"We've stayed at Dan's over several years and have been enriched by our Mexican home experience. Dan calls it a hotel but it really is home for whomever stays in one of his wonderful apartments or cabanas. Stunning views of the Pacific, of interior courtyards and their flowers and the loveliness of poolside living make each day a treat. From a host who cares about his hotel like his child to the friendly and efficient office and housekeeping staff, from your laid back neighbours to the always envious visitors, Casa de Dan makes your Mexican stay rich, delightful and effortless. Our favourite 'home' was Big View apartment # 8. Dining, cooking, entertaining, reading, 'hammocking' - all took place out of doors. Sleeping and showering were inside activities. Beautiful designs of"
50,"I actually stayed here in 2007..twice because it was so good!  And I still recommend the place to friends heading that way.  The improvements they've made since then means a great place keeps getting better and better. The view, accomodations and location are all fantastic, the staff even more so and Dan and family make you feel incredibly welcome, like part of the community - which isn't always the case in surf towns."
50,"This place is popular all year round and often booked solid for months for the simple reason that it is the best value for money in Mexico.The rooms are like simple well maintained apartments with separate kitchen areas great for long term guests. Before visiting Dan's, I would travel with my own tool kit  to fix the room, no need for that here.The breakfasts and lunch are great where you often get to talk to the owner(Dan).Great rooms,great pool,great breakfast,fantastic staff and excellent location (near Playa Zicatela)."
50,"La Hacienda is a haven of peace and tranquillity and well run by the energetic Adrian Rojas.  Both he and Bernadette, the Parisian owner and interior designer, work hard to ensure that guests are well looked after and made to feel welcome. It’s not really a hotel , more of a residence or a home from home. The suites are delightful and fully equipped with kitchens so you can totally look after yourself  if you like. One trip to the town’s market brought out the cook in me as the food available there is incredible. The market is a pleasant place to wander around and have a meal, snack or drink too - incredibly colourful. You may just want to laze indolently around the pool at La Hacienda in its idyllic tropical garden or perhaps wander down to one of three nearby beaches."
50,"We love trees and flowers so what the owner did with this place was absolutely fantastic.  We also like quiet and we found it here.  The rooms were decorated with Parisian flair, spacious and well equipped in the kitchen.  The pool was a nice addition and there was always cool jazz and french music playing.  The owner is so charming and we were always offered wine if it was served.  So one always felt welcomed  It's definitely not a place for the young and boisterous, and I noticed that the last reviewer Anilu gave it a bad review however, she is in the 18-24 range (written in Spanish that the owner had to quieten she and her group of friends in the pool area around 11 p.m.).  Probably true, but most of the guests are older and do appreciate this peace and quiet.  The lively"
40,"The room was fine. We got there early ( plus or minus) 8:30 AM . A room was available for one of the two couples traveling. The rooms were spacious, and airy with a TERRIFIC interior design in the garden/pool area. My friends decided they wanted to cook while we were there - between the two rooms we were able to come up with the basic necessities ( dishes/pots) ..... yeah I know - I wouldn't cook either .. but, in case YOU MIGHT BE thinking of it ... it might be tough getting all the equipment.   As mentioned, the hotel is clean.... however I would like to mention that our friends did have ants in their room ( the red kind) that bite, and the first day we were there - there were cantaloupe seeds all over the kitchen floor and cabinets ....  However,  they did clean this on the"
50,"The most beautiful place to stay in hands down is Suites La Hacienda. I had an amazing time there, and they really deserve a mention. It is located in the Rinconada, 5 minutes by foot from Carizalillo beach (not to be confused with another hotel called La Hacienda Revolucion). Suites La Hacienda is like a little paradise- gardens full of flowers, lovely swimming pool, beautiful spacious suites with fully equipped kitchens, air conditioning, etc. The place is extremely well-maintained. The owner Bernadette is such a kind and splendid host, and Eva who looks after most reservations and administration is also wonderfully helpful. If you're looking for gorgeous and tranquil accommodation, this is the best kept secret of Puerto Escondido. (---) (But the pictures do not do justice to"
50,"Simply perfect! My wife and I recently spent 5 nights on the last days of December and had a great experience. The suites are very nice, spacious (1 room, 1 restroom, living area, kitchen, balcony), comfortable, well equipped (fridge, satellite TV, A/C, roof ventilators, kitchen equipment, wifi) and nicely decorated. Each suite has its own balcony and beach/ocean views.   Location is also excellent! Right on Zicatela beach, about 1 minute away (walking) from the beach, and 5 minutes walking from the main part of Zicatela where all the restaurants/cafes/bars are located... close enough to walk, far enough to get some quite and peace.   The property is also very nice, full or gardens and a very convenient pool to cool off. The building is new so the suites, their equipment and the"
50,"We recently spent a week in this little piece of heaven.  The suite was perfect, newly constructed and decorated in a very homey and comfortable way.  It was ideally located just off the Zicatela strip, far enough away from the hustle and bustle to enjoy some peace and quiet.  The roof top terrace was excellent for taking in a sundown with a drink in hand.  The property was beautiful with many tropical plants creating a garden like setting and the owner Vicki was outstanding.  She was full of useful advice and made sure that our stay was perfect.  I would highly recommend staying at this property to anybody if they are looking for a very comfortable and fully equipped suite for their visit to Puerto Escondido."
50,"My boyfriend and I recently left our beautiful little suite that we stayed in for over a month, and I refer to it as being 'ours' because we really felt at ease and comfortable during our time there. Vicki has done an amazing job of decorating each suite with a different 'theme' for the paintings and furnishings and these personalised touches really make you feel at home as soon as you step foot through the door. We loved the location of the suite, as it was within an easy walking distance from the cafes, restaurants and shops, although it is still tucked away from the main street, which can get hectic and noisy during peak periods. As I love cooking, I was grateful to have a kitchen that was so well-equipped, with a decent stove and oven to use for roasting, baking, etc. The"
50,"Puerto Escondido is a wonderful town. I have vacationed there 4 times in the last 20 years. The town has grown but in quite a delightful way. It still has that small town feel but the restaurants have vastly improved as have the shops, etc. The beaches were always fabulous and, of course, they remain so.  This trip was by far my most favorite time spent in Puerto. The reason for that was where I stayed; Zicatela Suites on Zicatela Beach. I spent a month there and I loved it. My friend Rita, from Canada, recommended it to me. Vicki Cole, the owner, is a friend of Rita's. My apartment was a charming, clean, fully equiped one bedroom and I can think of nothing negative to say about it. It had a wonderful view of the beach and it took me 1 minute to walk across the street and I was"
50,"I love Puerto Escondido, have been coming here for 21 yrs and this was the first time that I found the perfect place to stay.  I stayed at Zicatel Suites for 2 wks in Sept. and everything was  pure luxury. Extra large bedroom, great size kitchen with a full size refrigator and stove. Couldn't believe even a blender, toaster oven and microwave was included, this was great as I like to cook when I am there. The living room and dinning area were very spacious. BUT the balcony took my heart as it was 6 ft wide and ran the length of the suite,  with a covered plapa roof that  complete shield the sun. I will be back in Jan. for my annual month visit and will bring my husband. I can hardly wait."
50,"I LOVE Puerto Escondido. I love the big wide beaches and that the ocean is always a perfect temperature. I love the food (the restaurants and the amazing Mercado). I love the people (the locals and the visitors). The only thing missing was nice and clean accommodation on the beach. I am happy to report that Zicatela Suites has filled that gap. Now there are BRAND NEW apartments on the beach (near to restaurants, but not too close). They have all the amenities you’d hope to have (full kitchen, AC, fans, pool, wify, nice bathrooms, parking, etc.), and they are also tastefully decorated. I loved the colors of the walls. The apartments have terraces, which is very important to me because I like to eat outside. Maybe best of all though, is the palapa covered roof top balcony. It’s"
50,"The Mayflower Hostel and Hotel, and the proprietor Minne, are outstanding in service, cleanliness and knowledge. We made the mistake of spending our first two nights in Puerto Escondido at another hostel. Luckily we made a break for the well reviewed Mayflower and ended up staying with Minne for 2 months. Due to our previous experience cleanliness was a major want in our new accommodations and Minne absolutely delivered. Fresh linens, clean washrooms, and an overall great atmosphere. We had the chance to stay in both the dorms and in private rooms. You fvan mingle and meet other travellers or just take quiet time for yourself. The Mayflower location is close to the main action on Zicatela but the atmosphere also pumps on the adoquín at night. Minne's staff is excellent and she"
50,"I stayed at the Mayflower with Minnie and the gang for over 7 weeks! Amazing! Minnie really knows how to show her guests the utmost courtesy and hospitality with unwavering professionalism. She fluidly jumps from German to Spanish to English.  Her place is large beautiful and super clean! Her staff are great! Security is friendly and gave me a real sense of safety. There is a spacious kitchen and great social area where tonnes of new international friends await. This hostel is great for the single traveler, groups of friends, and also families. There is accommodation that is appropriate for all types. Mayflower is a short walk to a major super market. Buses and cabs are super cheap and fun to get around in, but the hostel is a 1 minute walk from the BEAUTIFUL Playa Principal. If"
30,"Good hostel with lots of communal space so has a good atmosphere. It's just off the main steet, easy distance fro the bus station and places to eat but bit of a walk to the main surf beach. We had a private room which was basic but clean and had a view of the sea. Didn't get a hot shower and the fan in the room was knackered but other than that enjoyed staying there."
40,"After having a really bad night in another hotel in Puerto we moved to the Mayflower for 3nights. Our room was clean, very spacious and had a nice sea view. Unfortunately there were construction works just in front of the hotel, so that we were rudely awaken even on sunday morning. Besides, the day we checked out we were told that we would have to pay 20pesos each if we wanted to have our luggage kept at the hotel after the check out. I think this is kind of greedy, it should be part of the service and not an additional favour. Most hotels keep your luggage once you checked out without requiring any pay."
50,"This is a really fun place to stay, hung out in the common areas a lot and made a lot of friends.  Great central location and pretty clean."
40,"We decided to take the bus (suburban)  from Oaxaca to Puerto Escondido  if you decide to do this, take Dramamine before you get on the bus. It's a 7 hour mountain drive. The woman next to me vomited on my shoes and didn't fess up to it. The driver tried to get me to clean it up with a kleenex and my bottle of water. My Spanish wasn't good enough and the woman didn't even speak Spanish...another indigenous dialect. But...back to the Mayflower. After a pretty long walk we found the Mayflower. We stayed in the hotel part and it was very cheap, which we liked. Our room was clean, the decor was simple but nice, and the staff was friendly. I would definitely reccomend this place for budget travelers of any age."
40,"I thought the Mayflower was really cool. The location was perfect (unless you want to surf, in that case - stay somewhere on Zicatela beach). The staff was very friendly and they make sure it's quiet when some people go to bed. At 10 they kick you out of the dining room and at 12 you have to leave the terrace, no curfew though. Breakfast not included in the price."
40,"Stayed here in May 09 for 5 days, had a private room which the manager discounted as they were doing construction work in the hotel. Beer was cheap, had a great kitchen and common area to hang out. 2 mins walk to the beach, and 10 mins from Zicatela. Quite strict with the rules about keeping quiet after midnight which is appreciated. The manager was also helpful showing us where the best beaches are. Rooms were nice and clean with a fan and television."
50,"Great place for a cheap but nice stay in Puerto Escondido.City Beach is 2 minutes walking while  playa Zicatela is about 10 minutes  but at night it's better to take a taxi, the beach is really dark!

50,"My husband and I are regular Puerto Escondido visitors and have stayed at many of the local hotels and condos.  This year we had the pleasure of renting Condo Miramar in the Leblon building near the lighthouse.  We had a wonderful experience from the moment we arrived.  The condo itself is beautifully appointed and has everything you might need.  The owner, Minne Dahlberg, who also runs the Mayflower Hotel, had provided flowers, and came to visit us the first day to make sure everything was in order.  Minne is a fund of information for travelers unfamiliar with the area, was most kind and gracious in every way.  When I close my eyes, I can imagine the spectacular views from every room of this condo and can't wait to return next year.  Barbara Chase Boston, MA, USA"
50,"This hotel exceeded expectations for our weeklong family vacation.  In total we rented 4 rooms and all had the amenities you'd expect. The rooms had a/c and were cozy. The beds were comfortable enough, and were typical of what you'd find at a super 8. Though my brother-in law lives in the town and he's said that this is one of the most well known and nicest hotels in the area. You won't find a true 4 star in this town. The restaurant was near gourmet quality for every meal and the staff was very attentive to our wants. The next time I come to Puerto Escondido, I WILL stay here. We enjoyed the gardens in the hotel, once you walk in you can tell that the owners care about the hotel's character and cleanliness. Beach is just right across the street and near beach dining"
50,"My wife and I stayed a week at this hotel with a group of friends, and I must say I loved everything about it. The hotel has a very rustic feel to it that fits in just amazingly with this surfer/hippie town.   We specially appreciated the food at this hotel, their menu is restricted to seafood and vegetarian options but no matter what you choose its always fresh and amazing. To me it was one of the highlights of the trip.   Hotel is located at the beach with plenty of other restaurants and nightlife options.   Staff was super friendly."
50,"Great food and really great staff. Fiance and I had a good time here, they only serve vegetarian and seafood dishes. Room was big and spacious, bed was comfortable. The view to the ocean is fantastic and you're within walking distance of the beach."
50,"The hotel is beautiful, the staff is AMAZING, the food is excellent, fresh and a wonderful view of the ocean while you eat.  Location is great, easy to get to other beaches, shops, etc by walking or short taxi ride.  Very peaceful areas around pool or views of the ocean to relax, read or spend time with family and friends.  They have a great coffee cafe downstairs!!  The rooms and bathrooms are spacious, nice balconies to enjoy a morning cup of coffee and fresh drinking water closely available to all rooms.  Highly recommend - this is our second stay and we will be back for sure!"
40,"Hotel Santa Fe offers a great location with excellent outdoor spaces for gathering with other guests.  Large room had a ceiling fan and air conditioning which can be nice if you want to escape the afternoon heat for a while. Hard to beat the restaurant for great food and service.  The staff was very friendly and treated me like an old friend each time I ate there.  In fact, I only ventured out to other restaurants a couple of times.  There just wasn't much reason to look any further. Two nice pools and a great elevated patio for watching the sunsets. One thing I will point out is that this hotel seems to be mostly enjoyed by older adults and may seem a little bit like a retirement community.  If you are trying to avoid the nightlife of Puerto Escondido as I was, that can be a"
20,"Great location. Paid for one hotel but they put us next door in the Santa Cruz, both are incredibly overpriced, mucho over priced for what you get.  The Cruz is getting beat up. Don't trust the pictures.  The balcony was covered with old bird dung.Have a crappy time eating there.  Of course the old stained toilet broke, not plugged, broke and it took hours to clean up the mess, our stuff soaked, management totally indifferent to be generous. The old story, once they have your money, once they fleece you, you're nothing but an inconvenience. So, poor value and a shortage of honesty."
50,"The food was great, our room was decorated very nicely and we had an awesome view of the ocean directly across the street.  The pool was great, staff was super friendly and always will to offer advice on interesting things to do and see."
50,"Very pleasant low key hotel with good service and lovely location - pools and property well kept. Beaches within walking distance to either side. Excellent vegetarian cuisine. Puerto Escondido is relatively unspoiled with no high rises so is ideal for tourists, visitors and ex-pats who wish a pleasant and comfortable place to visit."
50,"The hotel is located right at the beginning of Playa Zicatela and is hence comparably quiet. The restaurant and the sun terracce, as well as some of the rooms offer a stunning ocean view. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, even though communication is sometimes a little difficult as some employees speak very poor English. The rooms are spacious, very clean and beautifully furnished - very typical mexican.The hotel in general is beautiful with a lot of edges and cornes and colourful mexican tiles. It has a lot of charme and personality. The food in the restaurant is delicious, yet expensive compared to other places in Puerto Escondido. However, if you appreciate fresh and tasty food, you should be willing to pay for it! I can highly recommend this place!!"
20,"I tried to make a reservation directly with the hotel several times through email but never got a response.  I bailed out and booked through Expedia.  Upon arrival at 8:00, a very unfriendly front staff member assigned us the worst room in the hotel.  It was in the back, stuffy, and with a door opening out onto a claustrophobic space with some sad palm trees. I had to press the reservation staff to show us a better room.  I believe they may have been uncooperative because we booked and paid through Expedia.  It is very poor customer service to treat their guests this way--I had to see three rooms before they grudgingly gave us a better room--of course we also had to pay $24 more.  It seems they don't care much--probably because of their location on Zicatela Beach. For the price"
50,"Out of nearly 100 hostels over the past 10 years this is by far the best hostel I have ever stayed in.  The hostel is a converted mansion that has incredible artwork and is impeccably clean.  The staff is amazing and they all ensure that you have the best stay possible.  The kitchen is fully stocked and the hostel is amazingly close to Carizalillo, the supermarket, and bus stations.  There is a great pool with a volleyball net, snorkel equipment, and a ping pong table.  The hostel had such a nice family feel to it and it was incredibly hard to leave!"
50,"Like coming and staying at your mates place on the beach. The staff made the place super friendly and chilled, but were still there for anything you needed. The hostel is huge, bright and airy. The dorm rooms comfy with huge bathrooms and windows. Plus a pool, rooftop hammocks and a beautiful beach right nearby. This is why we didn't want to leave!! "
50,"The hostel is very nice and clean. The staff was awesome and really helpful and we had a lot of fun hanging out with them. During the day you can either go to the beach, which is really close by or you enjoy your time at the pool, drinking some beer ;)  We only wanted to stay for one night, but we ended up staying there for three nights.  We would absolutely stay there again. Saludos of the Dutch-German-couple to Ross and his team.  PS: We highly recommend to play chess with Ross :P"
50,"Excellent hostel. Bright, spotlessly clean, creative decor and lovely staff! Myself and my brother and friend stayed there twice over the last few weeks while passing through and I will go back again next week.  The pool is a great bonus! Sociable, friendly atmosphere and close to everything you need especially the beautiful beach of carazilillo."
50,"We loved our time here. we had a double room with ensuite which was very spacious and reasonably priced at 400 MX. Only thing i would say is if you can get the double room upstairs its slightly nicer. The breakfast was good with pancakes and coffee. The lounge area was very spacious and a nice place to do your internet stuff and the internet worked well. The pool area was lovely and a god send in the hotness of Escondido! They are re tiling the pool soon so it will be even better :-) Staff were very friendly and it was situated excellently, close to the restaurants and the swimming beach which was gorgeous!"
50,"A great social and fun hostel! Clean and very spacious, this place was made to be a hostel. The staff are excellent and make lots of activities available to join in on. Highly recommended, thanks guys :)"
40,"it is a good hostel, which I really liked. I've stayed in it twice. and I will stay there again if I come over. there is an open kitchen that anyone can use and a clean bed with good mattress: we had a pizza afte which was super cozy. all I can say is if you ar coming to puerto escondido so stay there :)"
50,Another wonderful stay at this great hostel.  The management and staff and always happy a ND helpful and I really get the feeling like I'm a guest and not just a costumer.  The owner Ross is a cool dude and backpacker with lots of fun stories of his adventures in Mexico and the are always up for taking you to do some fun things aroind town. We went for a night swim in a lagoon that had Bioluminiscence with the staff and it was amazing. Thanks for another great stay and I'll be back asap. Keep up the great work.
40,"Stayed in Puerto Escondido for a few nights on our travels back in March-14. Booked Vivo Escondido in a nice area to the west of downtown. This is basically a place an American guy bought and is still converting to a hostel. Has some pros/cons. Had a basic private room, no air-con, but had ceiling fan. Poorly applied netting to parts of the window. Bedsheet used on lower part of window as curtain from outside. Haphazard do-it-yourself waffle machine for breakfast. Massive kitchen for use. Free water. Really nice social area both indoors and outdoors near the nice pool. They have some great paintings and designs around the house from artist guests.  Needs to be ran a bit better by the owner, and heard him say some inappropriate comments to a canadian couple one night when we all"
50,"I stayed here for a few nights. The place is beautifull, colourful, clean and spacious. The pool is perfect, hang out areas are great... This place has everything you need... Staff is very friendly and helpful. Thabk you guys!!"
50,"My partner and I came to stay here for 2 days and ended up here for ten! The rooms are lovely and spacious, and impeccably clean. They can get very hot but it is Mexico after all, and there is a lovely clean pool to cool off in. There is a lovely communal dining space with cheap beers available and kitchen facilities as well (but the hostel is close to many fab eating options as well!)  The staff are fabulous, they make this place the best place to stay! On our first night one of the staff members, Liz, helped organise a boat trip out to see phosphorescence in a nearby lagoon, what an incredible experience! Through Hostel Losodeli we made some wonderful friends, and we were put onto the Oasis Surf Academy where we took surfing and spanish lessons. Our time in Puerto was made"
50,I came for 5 days and stayed 19. Puerto Escondido is a great palce but this hostel made me stay my extra 14 days and I really enjoyed my stay. The staff are so friendly and are eager to make your stay really good. They will organise trips for you that are not overly expensive. There is a large very clean pool alongside the showers and rooms which are kept spotless. The large airy shared kitchen is great and so is the security with individual boxes in rooms and also your own key to your room. This hostel situated near the beachs is very highly recommended.
50,"This small hostel was great! The location is abit out the main town but was fantastic if you wanted some peace and quiet to relax around the pool. It is run by just one lady, Liz, who is very helpful and friendly and can't do enough for you. She even brought a birthday cake for us when she knew we were celebrating a birthday. The showers are a bit hit and miss for hot water but the weather was so hot that we didn't mind."
50,"This hostel is awesome ultra friendly, helpful staff make it even better. The location is perfect close to the beaches you actually want to swim in and close to cheap restaurants and shop. The pool is spotless along with the rooms. There is good security with lock boxes in each room and the entire place is always spotless. Highly recommended "
40,"I stayed at Losodeli for two nights while passing through Puerto Escondido. It´s located a few blocks up the main highway from the ADO bus station (walking distance) and though not the most beautiful neighborhood, it was within reasonable walking distance of Carajillo, Manzanillo and Angelito beaches--ie the only decent swimming beaches in town. Its near the Carajillo street with loads of nice restaurants, an internet cafe and shops. It was a bit of a walk from the main pedestrian street, but near enough to the highway that you can catch a Zicatela (surfer beach and home of much of the night life/touristy restaurants) or Punto (lovely part near the sea) bound colectivo very easily.   The hostel is kept very clean--as is the pool, which is a definite plus in between beach-hopping"
50,"This hotel has charming apartments and cabanas; a great lap pool and poolside area; beautiful mature gardens throughout; a reliable restaurant with excellent food, large portions and reasonable prices; and staff that are friendly, prompt, knowledgeable and helpful.  The beds and bedding are top quality.  Far enough from the nightlife for a good sleep and close to the beach.  Dan, his staff and fellow guests create an atmosphere welcoming to all.  Most of the guests have been coming to Dan's for years.  I have booked a room to return next winter. . ."
50,"We wanted to stay at Dan's from the start but they were full. Dan and his friends helped us find a place right up the street and we were instant friends. We spent most of our time at Casa de Dan, just hanging out and had breakfast at the cafe' every morning. Dan is such a loveable, generous, and helpful host! Thank you so much Dan. Even though we didn't get to stay in the place. My parents are on their way in Sept. and I hope they can get reservations. A definite MUST STAY place in Puerto...hard to get in, but so worth it. The breakfasts are the very best. The pingpong tournament is AWESOME! WHOOOOHOOOO! We won!"
50,"If you are looking for an exotic experience away from home but still want the feeling of home and family, Casa Dan is the only place to stay in Puerto. You're not there more than one night before you know half the guests as they meet around Dan's kitchen table or by the pool or maybe in Dan's Cafe sampling the delicious fish tacos and their enormous bowls of fruita con yogurt y granola..Had a fabulous visit and will return again and again...Almost all the guests I met had been coming to Dan's for years.. Very close to the main surf beach and far enough away from the noisier night life."
50,"I've stayed in several of the apartments, and they were each unique and beautiful. Very well appointed.   Beautiful tile, incredible views, beautiful gardens,  comfortable beds,  wonderful kitchens, amazing colors throughout. There's a very nice swimming pool on site as well. Dan and his staff are a big part of the charm here. Since my last visit, they have opened a restaurant that I'm excited to check out.  Word is out that the food is quite delicious."
50,"Casa Dan puts it all together - this is the place to stay! The rooms are little apartments with kitchen facilities, nicely appointed with rugs and spreads made in Oaxaca. Everything is clean and well kept. The grounds and gardens are lovely, quiet, and complete with a swimming pool. Some of the rooms have spectacular views of the beach, and even if you don't get one of those rooms, there is the 'look-out' deck at the very top for anyone to enjoy the sweep of the surfing beach. The staff are friendly and helpful. The Delux Cafe has great food - big portions and very reasonable.  And it is an easy walk to all the restaurants along the beach strip for dinner choices. This place has it all, but book as soon as you can - people keep coming back and the place fills up."
50,"Simply the best! Best location, value, service and view! I have been a ""Frecuent Flyer"" for the last 7 years in Casa de Dan, It get better and better! Dan makes sure you have an awesome stay! Saludos Pepe"
50,"I have stayed at this hotel for more than 10 weeks so far over two summers, and I am booked for 8 more weeks next summer.  Do I have to say more?  I have been to Puerto Escondido 6 times and since I found this spot I stopped looking for other arrangements.  The owner and staff are simply fantastic.  The place is very clean and the cafe is amazing.  A very comfortable location just up the hill and away from the main, busier main beach road, and it has a wonderful view of Playa Zicatela.  My wife and kids love it as much as I do."
50,"This place completely made my Puerto Escondido. We had one of the big rooms (room 8) and the outdoor space was just as big as inside with a hammock overlooking the cabanas and the sea. Perfect! We spent a lot of time just swinging in the hammock listening to the waves.   We don't surf and the beach is very much for the waves only, you can't swim in the sea here so the hotel's pool was great too. I could have stayed here forever. "
50,"Wow, that's as interesting review.  My friends and I have stayed at the Mayflower and at the beautiful Miraar condo.  As comfortable and fun as the Mayflower is, Miramar can't be beat in Escondido.  Fabulous view, location, decor and also a dishwasher!!  We've found Minne to be nothing orhter than helpful beyond our expectation.  Minne is completely connected in the community and beyond, so she is able to create the unexpected, get assistance with any type of handyman issue, etc.  We have been enjoying Minne's accomadations and service for 10 years.  I have seen her in action and I wouldn't want to cross her... I'm wondering where things went wrong."
50,"i stayed a few nights at the mayflower in december 2007. the place is impeccably clean, extremely well run, well-maintained, and obviously well managed by owner, minne.   rules within the hostel are simple, but fair to ensure everyone has a safe, and enjoyable stay here. lockers, hot water showers, kitchen, and a bright, cheery atmosphere make for good value at this HI affiliated hostel.   my only regret was not being able to stay longer. i'll be back at the mayflower, no doubt about it. i felt at home here!"
50,"We are a Mexican family and love the Mayflower, just love it.  But we decided for the last 2 years to take the condo Miramar, also owned by the Mayflower, because it is just so amazing.  The views, the amenities, the impeccably clean and caringly decorated apartment, the huge patio by the ocean, just perfect for us.  And into the bargain we get the knowledge and experience of the owner who knows so much about the area.  We have rented the apartment 3 times so far and can´t wait for our next vacations in Puerto Escondido to do it again."
50,"I spent about six weeks at the Mayflower this January and February.  It wasn't my first time in Puerto Escondido, but it was the first time I'd ever felt secure and comfortable in a hostel there.  Minne and the staff are extremely helpful and accommodating, and very good about maintaining security on the premises, despite it being just off the Adoquin.  The beach and bars are 50 meters away, and the guests at the hotel are outgoing and fun.  I will definitely return."
50,"I first discovered the Hotel Mayflower in 1989.  The owner, Minne Dahlberg, was so helpful to me, my sons, and their friend, that she made a lasting impression on all of us.  I've lost count of how many times I have returned over the course of the past 19 years.  I am always impressed with how many of the guests in the hotel are return visitors.  The guests come from all over the planet, which always makes for interesting encounters.  Minne speaks several languages fluently; she is always willing and able to sort things out when someone is feeling particularly lost (and haven't we all when we traveling in a country that we don't speak the language?). I've also attended parties at the Miramar condo that she owns and rents to small groups.  Everyone always seemed to be happy as"
50,"I've been staying at the Mayflower for 15 years or more and I've always loved it.  It has a great location, it's very clean, and Minne, the owner, is friendly, full of information and speaks several languages.  She is also extremely helpful, even going so far as to take me to places when I couldn't find my way.  The last time I was there she mentioned that she had a condo for rent and it was gorgeous!  Right on the water. Fabulous views. Spacious and well-layed out and beautifully furnished. We moved in and loved it and would definitely stay there again.  In fact we may go back again in a few months because we enjoyed this trip so much."
10,"I set-up accomodations through the Hotel Mayflower with Minne Dahlberg (who runs the Mayflower) for my family's stay at a private condo that she also runs.  Working with Minne was a nightmare.  She lied to us over and over and was also quite hostile.  Please see my review of the Condo Miramar, Puerto Escondido for more thorough details."
50,"Stayed here for 4 days in July.  it was 100 pesos a night for one person soabout 5quid.  the beach is opposite the hotel and i had such a great time here.  lots of young backpackers, pool table, bbq and the beach a stumble away.  lots of bars nearby and it's very relaxed.  there's a big kitchen table where everyone seems to sit around and chat, and a kitchen and FREE internet (although there was always a bit of a queue).  I met so many nice people here, i didn't want to leave!  Top stay if you're up for some fun.  You can get from Puerto to almost anywhere pretty easily on the buses."
40,"stayed at mayflower over new years. the staff were very helpful, the rooms were big and the bathrooms were quite clean. i saw staying in a bunk dorm which became very loud at night (you can here parties from the main street, el adoquin at 3am). rooms have fans. showers only supply cold water. atmosphere was great. they change the bedding every day. also has a communal kitchen and free internet access. "
50,"This is a great, clean, safe, simple hotel. A great value for what you get! The proprietor is very friendly and helpful and speaks several languages. There's a swimming pool available and a terrace bar with a knockout view and a pool table.  They have a web site with lots of visitor info and a database of local attractions: mayflowerpuertoescondido. It's a great information resource about Puerto Escondido. "
50,"Vivo Escondido was perfect. We meant to stay a few nights, ended up there for longer than a week! Easy walk down the steps to Carazillilo (perfect swimming beach) and 40pesoa or a long hot walk to la punta - no surf when we were there in Feb though.   We had a private room which was great, hostel was super clean, kitchen had everything we needed, laundry was cheap  and wifi was good - didn't work in our room but the common areas were spacious and sociable.  Owners are great, friendly enough to go out socialising with if you want to, no worries if you're not in the mood. If Jamie's still around when you go, have one of his 50peso dinners. Otherwise get yourself a falafel wrap for 30pesos from el sultan down the road,delicious.  Pool was excellent too. "
50,Stayed at Vivo for 2 weeks and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. Ross and the rest of the staff are very knowledgeable of the area and always have suggestions on things to do. Ping pong and the pool are awesome. Beds are newer and comfy. Excellent meals also by the cook Jamie. I defienately plan on returning to vivo escondido for my next year's vacation. 
50,The hostel is located close to some really nice beaches! We arrived after a 13h busride and since our room was not ready we went straight down to the beach - beautiful !! The staff is really helpful and the hostel itself has a pretty artsy decor. The pool and the hammocks are perfect for relaxing. Check out the happy hour at the beach resort of hotel Villa Sol from 12-1pm!!!
50,Close to the beach and restaurant street. Great place for solo and group travellers. You should book accommodation in advance. You could bake pancakes for breakfast every morning.  ***********  Rantaa ja ravintolakatua lähellä. Hyvä paikka yksin tai ryhmässä matkustavalle. Kannattaa varata majoitus etukäteen. Voit paistaa pannukakkuja aamiaiseksi joka aamu.
40,"Loved this hostel - we stayed for 4 nights. it has a great vibe, a pool and fab little roof terrace with hammacks. cheap beers and free coffee/pancakes in the morning are a bonus. the dorms are nice and spacious - though an extra bathroom would be nice."
50,"We ended our tour through Mexico with a one week vacation at Vivo Escondido and it was the cherry on the cake of our trip: Great atmosphere, kind of like a big family (the hostel is comparatively small which probably helps), very friendly and helpful owner and staff, very clean, nice kitchen, comfortable beds, art all alround the building, selfmade nice furniture, good location, close to the beach, cafés, restaurants. As if that was not enough there is a swimming pool which you can actually use and a rooftop with hammocks. We rented the private room with bathroom (the biggest bathroom I have ever seen) which matches the rest of the hostel and comes with a fan (we did not miss aircondition), a double bed and a single bed.  For breakfast they prepared pancake dough and you could"
50,"An awesome chill out hostel. Essentially a huge converted mansion so great common areas, large dorms, great pool and bar, large kitchen, cool rooftop with hammocks and views to the ocean.  And can't forget the funky murals everywhere - the iguana was my fav.  Easy walk to the beach, shops and eateries and into town.  We only stayed a couple of days but could easily have stayed a lot longer!"
50,"My girlfriend and I just spent a couple of nights here and it was great.  A friendly welcome makes a huge difference, and that's what we got. A relaxed atmosphere with some of the guests contributing to the scene- literally with paintings on the wall. There are some very good pieces of art and it adds to the chilled out vibe. Good wifi- clean- comfy bed- breakfast (myo pancakes), a pool and a short walk to the beach. We'd be happy to stay here again."
50,"I have stayed in my fair share of hostels and Vivo Escondido is definately the best. I first checked in for 4 nights, ended up staying for 4 weeks!!! The most beautiful beach in Puerto is a 2min walk away and there is awesome food and cafes also within a 2 min walk from the hostel. The hostel itself has awesome people, awesome art, awesome pool, awesome family style dinners, ping pong table, cold beer, tequila and mezcal!!! what more do you want? get there."
50,"Best Hostel I have ever been to. Stay here! Friendly staff, good vibes and great facilities. Even if you surf, just stay here and taxi to the surf spots (30-40 pesos). You will enjoy Peurto Escondido more if you stay here, period."
40,"This hotel offers all of the expected amenities, 2 great pools, view of the ocean and beach, within walking distance of restaurants and shopping.  Free wifi and purified water is provided.  The rooms are comfortable with large bathrooms and have good air conditioning and TV.  The hotel restaurant serves fine food with a view of the Pacific."
40,"Everything was great, the hotel its not new so the decor is not the greatest but everything works, its very comfortable, clean, the staff is friendly, the food is very good, swimming pools etc, clean, great temperature, my hubby had a great massage there."
40,The staff were absolutely the least friendly people I've ever encountered in a hotel(restaurant was a bit better). This would have been hands down 5 stars from me if I'd received so much as a passing smile or how are you but in 3 days not a single one. Still the property and rooms are stunning and the location is perfect.
30,Nice on the outside but when I was there one of the swimming pools was drained  The othe thing is that the air conditioning is not enough for those rooms  It seems like the arqitect is the owner and he didn't hire anyone to do these I personally did not like that the only restaurant in the hotel was vegetarian  The place is well located and the price are ok
20,"Sure the view to Zicatela is great and the exterior is beautiful, but don't let those 2 factors fool you... after all you spend the most time sleeping and relaxing indoors and not outside. My wife and I were excited to stay at this hotel, until after our first night. We woke up with a great deal of mosquito bites (too many). You would expect a hotel that is placed in front of the beach to have mosquito zappers or nets but no... Well looking past the mosquito issue, this place is dirty like nobody's business. You lay down on the bed only to see a wood fixture above you filled with spider webs and the fan filthy dirty. Not only are the fixtures dirty but the indoor structure is gross, seeing some type of scum growing out of the stucco is just uncalled for. If you stay here, make"
50,"We stayed for 6 nights for our honeymoon in the junior suite. Absolutely perfect - the rooms are gorgeous and old Mexican style, the staff are so so friendly and you feel very safe, the location is perfect and within walking distance to everything at zicatela and surrounding beaches the other way, the view from the deck and restaurant is spot on and we literally spent 6 days straight eating the amazing food from the restaurant, sunbaking and watching the incredible surf!!! You will not want to leave! The staff are so friendly and welcoming - in particular the restaurant is out of this world and everything is delicious (including the cocktails!). We did not want to leave and will be back!!! Very highly recommended. Muchos Gracias Santa Fe!"
40,I loved this hotel. It has an old Mexico feeling about it. The perfect place to relax at the restaurant and check out the waves from the second story restaurant. I only gave 4 stars as its a little pricey.
50,"This place is not only beautiful but is also a great experience to relax, always clean, amazing bedrooms, clean pools, chilling areas, kind people doing their jobs, many kind of bedrooms to choose, very very nice oh and btw avoid high season."
50,"We stayed for a long weekend and everything was quite good. Rooms are nice and cozy, the pools are good for relaxing and having a swim and generally the staff os very nice. The only thing that should go a little quicker is the service at the pools. It took forever to get something to drink and eat. ...oh...and try the Mango juice!"
50,"Our third stay in this Puero Escondido standard confirmed our earlier opinions...its dependably very good, from competent checkin , well appointed rooms with AC and fans, beautiful grounds with two very clean pools and a fine vegetarian restaurant overlooking the famous Zicatella beach and nearby town beach with abundant restaurants.  we walked to a nearby restaurant 'El Caracol', where we enjoyed an interesting, basic,  Mexican/fusion meal."
50,"From the moment we arrived Viva Escondido we felt very welcome. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The facilities were clean and the location was great. Close to one of the only swimming beaches. We among many other guests decided to extend out stay because we enjoyed it so much. Pancakes every morning and a swimming pool, what else could you want! "
50,"What can I say about this fantastic place? If you are looking meet people, have fun, go to nice but cheap restaurants and are on a budget this is the place for you. With approx 25 beds it is a perfect size to get to know everyone, the kitchen is a good size, there is always someone about during the day and they have a noise curfew around about 11/midnight due to being in a residential area. We absolutely wish we could have stayed longer, it is like one big family with group meals organised to share costs. We want to say a huge thank you to the staff Chris, Suzi and Ellie for being so accommodating and doing everything in there power to make sure we had an awesome time. If we come back to Mexico we will definitely come back here!"
50,"What can I say, this is by far the best hostel I have ever stayed in! Really not even a hostel, more like a house full of friends and good people. Ross was a great host and knows how to show guests a great time. I was only planning on staying for a few nights and stayed well over a week. It is a hard place to leave! You can just chill by the pool and drink all day, go to the beach, hit the town or go kayaking, birdwatching- the list goes on. The town itself is great as well- full of great people, food, wildlife, and night life. Anything you are looking for! And this hostel is a great addition to it. Super clean, relaxed and safe. It is also in a perfect location. Close to great food and the beach! I could easily go back to Mexico just to hang out in Puerto Escondido and at this"
50,"This hostel is epic. The owner, Ross has done an amazing job of turning this once mansion into Escondido's best place to stay. Ross is also and amazing host and he rocks at showing his guest a good time. If your coming to Escondido don't miss out on staying here.  Great beds, cool staff, beautiful pool & everything is very clean. Also some of the best art pieces painted on his walls I've ever seen. As a hostel owner myself I know what makes a great hostel and this is absolutely an epic hostel. Thanks for the great time bro. I'll see you next time."
50,What can i say.. Its like i was at home.. Everyones so friendly the pool is cleaned everyday the paintings nikki and joe have done are amazing loved watching the progress they made.. Mongo the 70 year old mongolian painter who lives here for 2 weeks at a time is hilarous! Joel and trent and de were so helpful! I was sick for most of the time and they acted as big brothers to me.. They also let me organise a pirate party which everyone loved!! Nothing bad to say the dorms are also clean and beds massive!!!! Thankyou guys  Xxxx luci
50,"By far the best hostel my boyfriend and i went! The owner and the staff are so amazing!! We had a hard time leaving, we absolutely loved it! Anyone who is suppose to stay a day or two ends up staying longer than 1week! Brand new hostel with art everywhere, and if u are lucky youll get the chance to meet Ali Mongo who is a 78year old artist! (Chillest man ever) so we 1000% recommend this place! Thanks so much for everyhing ross xoox manu and karo!! "
50,"Everything about the hostel is amazing.. Great location comfortable beds and a great vibe as well...it's amazing what has been done in such a short amount of time, I can't wait to see how it will look a year from now!!"
50,"By far the most friendly, cleanest and most hospitable place I have ever experienced in all of the hostels I have ever stayed in.  Ross the owner is helpful in every way as well as the rest of the staff. He will stop what ever he is doing to assure you are taken care of. Open kitchen  is clean, organized and has every appliance one could imagine Location couldn't be better.  You feel as part of a family once there. A place of many ""P's....Pool, ping pong, personal, pleasing and protected.  Would venture out in Riconada any time of day or night by myself and felt 100% safe. Beach could not have been better. this place for sure has it going. Location/ location/ location. Jammie the chef prepares a great dinner every eve that is great and very reasonable. More than enough room for"
50,"We traveled with a big group and everyone at the hostel was incredibly accommodating. Beautiful place, great location, steps away from amazing beaches, and fabulous people. Could not have asked for more."
50,"This hostel also made me creat my first tripadvisor review. Great hostel with a great atmosphere. I think the location in Riconada is a great location, close to the market and 3 min walk to the nicest of the 3 beaches around Zicatella. The owner is a great help and helped me out with any questions I had. He also did the small extra things that made it a great stay. As it is a relatively new hostel I cannot wait to see how it is going to develop in an amazing place."
50,We stayed in Hotel Santa Fe the first time almost 30 years ago and we were delighted when we returned recently to find that it is still great! The architecture is lovely and the buildings well-maintained with additions blending perfectly with the older structures. The mature landscaping keeps the hotel feeling like it has always been where it is and provides refuge for at least one family of iguanas which we enjoyed seeing. The hotel has maintained a concession on the north end of Zicatela beach and has preserved it for the view and for easy access rather than developing it commercially. The food in the restaurant is authentic yet with original creative twists (chiles relleno with almonds) and the service is in all respects great.  
50,"We stayed here with our whole family––from an 88 year old grandmother to teenage children, everyone had a fantastic time. The hotel staff are friendly and eager to please, and were always running around to get this and that for us. The restaurant was excellent, and they had a ton of vegetarian options and were happy to make any alterations we asked for. Our room had a beautiful view of the water and a bed that was far more comfortable than we had expected. They also had many great connections with local guides––we will never forget a fantastic kayaking trip on a nearby lagoon and the beautiful birds we saw. All in all, it was one of the most amazing trips we've been on––we'll definitely be back!"
40,"The Santa Fe is a well established hotel at the town end of the Zicatela. From the restaurant and terrace there are views across the beach , but book your seat on the terrace for the sunset! Its just a hundred yards or so to the beach from the main entrance. The clientele includes many who return regularly to escape North American winters - in my case, the Scottish equivalent. Our room had a sea view, was spacious, simply appointed , but slightly faded.It could have done with more seating.Leaking taps suggested some maintenance was overdue. It was cleaned daily.  There are two pools, a lower one suitable for children and an upper one of about 17 metres, enough to get a few lengths in,and never too busy. There were problems with WiFi acces for two days of the week we stayed"
30,"The rooms - charming and unique, with Spanish colonial touches The service - warm and accommodating, although could be better at times The food - everything is fresh and very well done, although the menu hasn't changed in at least 5 years The location - the absolute best for the area  It's not a 5-star full service resort, so don't go in expecting that. It's probably the best resort in Puerto but the first time we stayed here, I joked to my husband that it felt like ""camping."" He said - ""You're at the beach, loosen up."" So, fair warning - there's often low water pressure, lots of mosquitos (get the coils or bring a bug zapper, like we do) and the bathrooms could use an upgrade (the sleeping rooms are all currently being renovated as of Feb 2015). But despite its lack of polish,"
20,Very disappointing. The surrounding are beautiful and grand. Seating with ocean view so inviting. The worst service in puerto. Completely ignored. Had to ask twice to place our order. It was not busy. Staff seemed to be visiting with each other.   Chile rellenos were very good. Fish dishes were inedible. How can a chef mess up a red snapper so that it is disgusting?  I am sad this was so awful because we were with special friends who had soooo looked forward to the evening.  Time for a mystery shopper/ diner folks
40,"This is a lovely hacienda-style hotel that works hard to maintain its charm.  The grounds are lovely and well-maintained and the staff and service are very good.  The hotel is 33 years old and is very classic in style with two swimming pools and comfortable lounge chairs shaded by trimmed palm trees.  The staff is extremely helpful with just about any request from directions, to housekeeping, to  recommendations for places to eat.  There is also a well stocked lending library with many mostly English-language books that previous visitors have left.  The hotel has air conditioning and ceiling fans, bottled water and cable TV with some English-language stations.   The restaurant, which is vegetarian, has delicious reasonably priced fresh food and the wait staff could not be more"
30,"The good things - air conditioning!  nice view, two pools, decent food and drinks (pricier than the neighborhood).  It is in a great location - at the beginning of Zicatela Beach, a perfect place to start, but also not in the center, so not as noisy.  But...We had a wonderful room with an ideal location above the adult pool. It seems the adult pool is not so adult.  It was difficult for us to enjoy this pool during the day because of the children at the pool, so we resorted to the beach. The number of kids increased at sunset. However, these kids weren't guests - they were locals.  Families come in with their kids and use the pool; we saw leave in a Jeep Cherokee with local plates. This happened every night.  Got drinks at the bar one night.  The bartender grabbed a dirty glass"
40,"This is probably Puerto Escondido's best option.  This 4 star hotel is well decorated in a Mexican colonial hacienda style with nice art work from mexican contemporary artist Alejandro Colunga. Located right on Zipolite beach and close to all beach clubs and bars. There aren't many options in Puerto Escondido maybe a few Holiday Inn style hotels but nothing great.  Good service as most of the Mexican hotels, nothing spectacular."
30,"When we arrived at the hotel we were encouraged by the sign that one of the pools was adults only . Unfortunately this was the case sadly an obnoxious family from New Jersey insisted on playing a ball game in the pool with their children disturbing those around the pool trying to relax. One lady protested politely but was told what do you expect when sitting by a pool , you are bound to get wet. Not wanting any direct confrontation we politely asked the reception what the policy was regarding the adults only pool. After receiving a get lost gringo look we were told it was a family pool. We asked therefore why they had a sign saying adults only . This was denied and the next day the sign was taken down. It was a pity as the hotel had 2 pools and could easily accommodated both"
40,"Our room was quite large with two double beds and a very nicely efficient air conditioner.  The bathroom was also spacious with a very nice shower. We ate in their restaurant which has lovely views of the of the ocean.  The bed was comfy, the room was quiet and we slept like rocks!"
50,"I stayed here for around six nights and really enjoyed it, so much it got me off my bum to make my first Tripadvisor review! Firstly, this is a new hostel, so don't be put off by the small amount of reviews. Secondly, trust all the great reviews Vivo is getting because yes, it is that good! There was so many positive things about Vivo Escondido - clean rooms, comfy beds, cheap drinks, a great pool, good areas to socialise, hammocks, excellent sized kitchen, free water, lockers etc. I met so many fun people here, and it felt more like I had rented a house with friends for the summer with how everyone hung out and chilled with each other. Everyone working at the hostel were really friendly, and would go out of their way to help. For example, I did some work in a little nook"
50,"I've stayed in plenty of hostels and I think this was literally the best one I've ever stayed in. The folks who run the place are awesome and super helpful, and the guy who owns the place is a super nice dude who will sit down and have a beer with you when he's not busy building new furniture for the hostel.   The beds are super comfortable, the rooms are clean, same with the bathrooms, the kitchen is more than well equipped, and the whole place just has the vibe of a really fun share house.   Jamie (one of the staff) cooks meals every night for a reasonable price, and the hostel also has a little bar that sells drinks fairly cheap.   Other pluses: swimming pool, fast wifi, quality sound system, 2 minutes from the local Main Street and 5 minutes to the beach, and above all else,"
50,"Vivo Escondido made a huge difference in the way I experienced Puerto Escondido during my second visit. The first time I visited I stayed in Tower Bridge backpackers and had a terrible experience (I would not recommend Tower Bridge to anyone!)  Ross, Jamie and the rest of the gang working at Vivo Escondido totally get it. They've traveled the world and applied their collective experience to creating a truly great place. I stayed in a mixed dorm. Bright and airy, comfortable beds, good shower, lockers for backpacks. Access through the room to the rooftop terrace with hammocks to lounge in, clothesline to dry towels and bathing suits.  Downstairs is a fully equipped kitchen with included pancake breakfast each morning. In the evenings, Jamie cooks a nightly changing meal for"
50,"Great hostel, really clean. It's a stones throw away from a couple of beaches and some great restaurants. It has it's own pool and bar/dining area where Jamie the in house cook makes some of the best food all sourced locally. Good facilities, from the fully equipped kitchen to the computer and wifi. The staff and owner Ross are all cool and really helpful. Danny & Nikki keep up the good work on the art around the place, it looks amazing.  It just a nice place to come and hang out for a couple of days with a really good vibe going on. Meet some great people here and hated leaving the place."
40,"Vivo Escondido is a new, very nice looking, well kept and cheerfully staffed hostel. The atmosphere is great, everybody feels at home around the pool, in the common room or on the roof terrasse where we slept in our hammocks. There may be still some open organisational issues to resolve like lockers for the people who sleep in the hammocks, but if you ask the staff they make everything possible and the great thing about going to this hostel while it's still shaping out to what it will be, is that every day there's a new painting on some wall and maybe you can even contribute to it. :) "
50,"I've travelled around Mexico quite a bit and seen some great hostels but this was definitely one of my favorites. The prices are good, beds are clean and comfy and the sitting area/bar/swimming pool outside is great for hanging out and getting to know the other guests. The best part however is definitely the atmosphere. Mallory, Nicky, Dani and Jamie are absolutely fantastic and we felt more like part of a community rather than hostel guests.   It's a bit further away from the main scene of Puerto Escondido but there's a great beach nearby and good places to eat. We especially liked El Cafecito and had breakfast there every day.   I would recommend staying here anytime!"
50,"Custom-made bunks that don't creak? fast wifi? In-house chef? Super-clean? Pool & cheap bar? Count me in! Stayed here for 10 days and it's super close to the best swimming beach in town, and lots of great places to eat. Bathrooms are kept clean and if you want to cook for yourself the kitchen is well equipped."
50,"Excellent location near the absolutely beautiful Carrazillio beach. Ross was an great, friendly host and made my stay very comfortable. The hostel itself was spacious and clean - great cooking facilities and pool. Had a sweet time, highly recommend!"
50,"I literally cannot say enough nice things about this hostel.  It was a huge mansion that has been converted into an amazing new hostel!!  The rooms are large and airy (very different from the majority of hostels in Puerto).  The staff are amazing - helpful, informative, and really willing to go above and beyond for their guests.  It has a very 'homey' feel and is the perfect distance from carrizalillo beach and the rinconada.  I was planning to stay here for 2 nights and ended up staying an entire week.  I never really review places I stay but I was so incredibly impressed with this place that I had to post this!! Go there - you're guaranteed to have the time of your life!"
50,"I stayed in one of the private rooms and it was just as good as a hotel in Puerto Escondido.  The location is fantastic because it's a short walk to the beach and to some of the livelier night spots.  The place looks brand new and it's probably cleaner than my parent's house (sorry mom).  Really, I felt like I was living in someone's beautiful home. The bed was more comfortable than the one I had in school.  Even the family dinner was an unexpected surprise.  The owner is super friendly and helpful even though he's a Boston fan through and through.  He said that he did a lot of the work himself and you can see his pride in the place.  This is my third hostel in the last month and it's the only one I decided to review because I feel guilty trashing the other ones (""trash"" being"
40,"Great location at the north end of Zicatela Beach with lounge area and restaurant providing views of the beach fishermen and/or surfers and an easy walk to the main surfing area.  The A/C unit just above our bed blew on us a bit too much, but was adequate to cool the room (could have been placed in a different area)The large bathroom has a nice shower.  There is a daily continental breakfast of a big glass of delicious, freshly squeezed orange juice, big cup of good coffee and several slices of homemade wheat or many grain thickly sliced, toasted bread with tasty strawberry jam to enjoy.  The fish and chips was good as was the shrimp stuffed avocado. Fermin, one of our friendly waiters, was always helpful.  It would be nice if all employees wore name tags.   Be sure to contact"
30,"Nicely situated at one end of the Zicatela beach and a very short walk to the bahia principal where you can find plenty of boaters ready to take  you out on a lanch (small fishing boat) to swim with a sea turtle, look for dolphins & tour the bays or on a fishing excursion.   The hotel was clean & comfortable, nice water pressure & hot water, and air conditioning, the staff was friendly & helpful. Would definitely return if I ever find myself in PE again & would recommend to others. PS there was no construction while we were there so hopefully that's been completed now.  And November is this region's low season so it's a great time to miss the crowds but still have great weather."
50,"Air Conditioning- oh ya!.  My turtle adventure with Natural Habit was great, except for the humidity.  I don't deal with that very well.  The hotel had AC. The pools at the hotel were perfect.  The landscaping was very pretty.  The restaurant had an awesome view of the ocean and the food was wonderful.  Everyone was friendly.  My room was very clean and comfortable."
20,"The hotel was nice & food great. However there was incessant, non-stop construction all day, every day. Really loud banging, machines. It was terrible. Can't even rest in your own room. This is not a hotel for relaxation. Ruined the whole trip."
30,"I did not stay at the Santa Fe, so this review is limited t the breakfast experience I had there. the layout and setting of the property are impressive.  It is ideally located for access to Zicatela beach, with all its night spots.  Playa Marinero would be just a short walk.  The pool and outside areas are attractive, set in lush gardens.    Service at breakfast was good, and the food itself was tasty and average value for money.  I would return."
40,"It is very easy to notice a hotel where management is involved in most details. We felt welcome since we cross the entrance, the front desk staff couldn't find our reservation, but she always wanted to help us. She offered new rooms for all of us. The restaurant menu is complete in all aspects, the have wonderful seafood, and a variety of plates. Bread is baked in house and is terrific. Food is delicious and the restaurant staff are also very attentive. Rooms are in a good shape, nothing to die for, but full of amenities! I really reccommend this hotel.  The only recommendation is to close the restaurant a little bit later"
30,I stayed at Hotel Santa Fe on a visit to buy real estate. For me it's not up to par with reviews. Rooms are dark and not very comfortable. Service is good. Restaurant was disappointing as I'm not a vegetarian and all they serve is vegetarian good. Great location. Was not happy during my stay. I would not return.
50,"The Santa Fe is still the best place to stay in Puerto Escondido.  I had a chance to make a return trip this year, and it was truly great to be there.  The incredible view from the restaurant, the lovely service, the beauty of the decor, all combined to make the Santa Fe a place I will always want to come back to.  Especially since I found that the Wifi now works well, and it was nice to find the same helpful staff.  Being at the Santa Fe in high season, when all of the rooms were taken, didn't detract from the chance to have a peaceful and relaxing vacation.  The spaciousness of the grounds and the lovely colonial architecture still seemed to  create an atmosphere of artful graciousness, no matter how many people were there.  I'll be sure to come back to the Santa Fe if I have"
30,"Architectural is a nice hotel with pools, colonial style... Very quiet, the clientele is often 65+... But is very expensive for the area and the rooms. The breakfast is a joke... Even with the pseudo special is still at least 25% too expensive... I hope they will rectify...and it's look if you pay cash you have a better rate..."
30,The most expensive place we ate at in Puerto Escondido. The food was acceptable but many other restaurants in Puerto serve better food and are not as expensive. The ambiance is very nice and the view is also very good.
10,"Location for the hotel is good. You get basically what you pay for, the rooms are not all that clean and the people at the reception are not very friendly. We booked the room for 2 nights but missed our flight, so we arrived on the second day. We ended up not even staying the night since according to the reception desk, I was getting phone calls directly to the hotel from my work. Something that was not possible since not a soul knew where we had gone to vacation. The person at the reception desk was adamant that I call the number, but I refused thinking they were trying to sell timeshares or what not. The person at the reception ended up going to our room 5 minutes later with phone in hand trying to get my wife to take the call saying it was my job calling back. I was in the"
10,"Es un hotel viejo, sucio, las camas espantosas, baños terribles, no puedes dormir Xq se escucha el bar de a lado!! Cero lo recomiendo, que decepción de hotel. Pasamos una noche de locura, nunca lo recomendaría! Nunca. No te dan toallas, no hay papel higiénico, nefasta mi experiencia"
30,"There are comments here from six years ago saying that the place needing updating. That is still the case. If they gave the place a coat of paint, put two or three pictures on the walls, and added a desk (something commonly missing from older Mexican hotels), I would have rated the place very good instead of average. Only some of the rooms have working TV's, but I didn't care about this. The pool is good. The location is good; close to the Playa Principal, the Av. Alfonso Pérez Gasga restaurant, bar, and shopping district, lots of other good restaurants, the Chedraui supermarket, and a couple of laundries."
40,"I think we got a midweek discount as we only paid 400 pesos for a double room with view on the pool. I think usual prices are higher (we didn't have to bargain, it was the listed prices).   The room was well equipped: AC, fan, cable tv, wifi and hot water.   The hotel has a pool and a shaded courtyard and is not far from the beach.   The rooms are dated though and could do  with a bit of TLC but are clean and comfortable enough.   For the price, it was well worth it. "
30,"I stayed there one night and was given my key at reception, as well as the tv control.  I went to my room and saw that it was NOT like the photo here.  Bare walls and a little sad looking.  Tried to turn on air conditioning and found that the taped- shut control lacked batteries.  So, I walked down the three flights to speak to someone in reception. After a while, a lady arrived with some batteries and I went back upstairs.  No go.  So I went back down and told the man at reception that I was not happy.  He sent someone up with me.  The man went to the breaker panel and turned on the power. OKAY.  There is a nice pool and the room was clean.  700 pesos."
50,Stayed here for about a week and loved it! It's located a few mins walk to Carrazillio beach - the only swimming beach in Puerto Escondido.  The beach is gorgeous!    The hostel itself has massive light airy rooms fitted with bunks that have large COMFORTABLE mattresses.  I slept very well the week I stayed here.  It has a large kitchen with self catering facilities.  Downstairs is a computer for guest use and there is free wifi.    The hostel is also close to Spanish language and surfing schools.  It is about 20 pesos in a taxi to Zicatela where most of the clubs and bars are (although you should expect to pay a bit more on the way back if you are leaving at 5am!).    The highlights of the hostel itself would probably be the pool and the rooftop hammock area where you can see
30,"Ninguna queja, hotel con lo necesario para una agradable estadía y con buena ubicación. Mi habitación contaba con aire acondicionado, ventilador, televisor, baño propio y amenidades como agua, jabón y shampoo. Solo estuve una noche así que no puedo opinar mucho más."
20,Para empezar no es el hotel que sale en las fotos! Esta barato y nos sacó del priblema porque llegamos muy tarde y no teniamos reservaciones. El cuarto bien solo que unos tienen ventilador y otros aire acondicionado (el precio varía). El problema fue que encontré varios bichos incluidos una cucaracha en el cuarto y baño! 
20,"El precio es muy alto para los servicios que ofrece, la comida es mala, el bar cierra temprano y en general no te llevan la bebida, tu tienes que acercarte al bar o se tardan mucho, los camastros siempre están sucios. Tienen un club de playa donde se sirve la comida, que está lejos y hay que llegar por escaleras que son muy pesadas. El área de juegos está encerrada y las instalaciones de todo el hotel son viejas. El concepto me parece abusivo con respecto al precio sobre todo el all inclusive."
30,"Buena localización pero hay algunas habitaciones muy muy húmedas donde es difícil respirar por la noche después de que el sol haya calentado la habitación. Otras están muy bien y incluso tienen buena vista al mar. El personal, sobretodo una mujer que trabajaba de día, fue horrible con nosotros. El personal nocturno y una chica nueva muy amables. La limpieza depende del día puede ser un desastre o estar muy bien."
10,"Reservamos este lugar por error por que era muy ""fotogénico"", pero nos encontramos con un hotel caro por su pésima relación calidad-precio, mal atendido, y sobre todo, muy sucio. Las sábanas olían mal, se podía escuchar a las cucarachas rondando por ahí apenas apagabas la luz (esto es verdad, no estoy exagerando), la habitación más desvencijada en que me he quedado en la vida. Al otro día salimos horrorizadas y buscamos otro hotel."
40,"My spouse and I stayed three nights at the Posada de Cortéz, despite the place being out of our usual price range. Since the place was undergoing renovations, we were able to stay here for lower than the usual price; similar deals may or may not be available, so check for yourself.  The place itself is gorgeous and well maintained, with flowers and trees laid out around a layered courtyard that creates a feeling of both openness and intimacy. The owner, Rosillo, was very kind to us, and she struck me as an excellent businesswoman, capable of finding us an arrangement that suited our needs and our price range.  We stayed in a room that the owner called a bungalow, on the third floor of one of the buildings at the back. This gave us a nice breeze, and a great view over the playa"
30,"Buena ubicacion, buena atencion del perdonal que ahi labora, limpieza de las habitaciones y precios accesibles, Si es recomendable la estancia en el hotel ya que se encuentra a escasos 5 minutos de las playas puerto angelito, carrizalillo, manzanillo y sicatela tiene cerca lugares para comer y para realizar compras, las habitaciones son amplias, resumo mi estancia como buena."
30,Llegamos a las 3 AM y el chico de recepción tubo una actividad nada servicial  no sé si se molestó por haberlo despertado ... Pero el huésped no tiene la culpa es su trabajo  Lastimosamente por un empleado mal capacitado en atención al cliente se generan mala imagen y percepción general de el hotel  Mi experiencia no fue satisfactoria no lo recomendaría
20,"They overcharged us 200$MX on our first night. The day after we were 20min late for the check out so they told us we'll be charged for 1wxtra day( whole price!!!). We stayed not to loose our money and when we went for the check out they accused us of not paying our second night (they never checked between staff,just came to us asking for money!!! Shameless."
30,Lo bueno: La atención del personal. Limpio.  Y el wifi. Aire acondicionado bien. Agua caliente.  Lo malo: no tiene alberca. Las habitaciones son pequeñas. Los colchones medio duros.  Es un hotel muy básico.
30,"Hotel a 3 cuadras de el adoquín, las camas son cómodas y el descanso es placentero, amenidades resurtidas, sin ruidos por las noches, anfitriones siempre al pendiente, buena opción para descansar sin buscar lujos o excesos "
30,"Felicito la amabilidad del personal del turno de la tarde y en especial del turno nocturno por su dedicación, disposicion y amabilidad. Pero reprocho al personal encargado de la limpieza de habitaciones que no mostraron el menor interés por poner en alto el nombre de la empresa que representan."
30,"Muy aparte de no tener parking y que la señal del WiFi no llegara hasta las habitaciones, quiero resaltar que por el precio alrededor de 700 pEsos Mex la noche vale mucho la pena. Muy limpio, muy tranquilo."
50,"Notre coup de coeur d'Amerique centrale!!! Situé entre l'axe principal et la plage de Zicatela, l'hotel béneficie d'une vue incroyable sur le spot de surf de Zicatela. Il y a 2 terrasses avec barbecue et hamacs bien entretenues et une piscine propre face à la mer. Apppartement spacieux, propre et bien amenagé avec cuisine equipés. Le gérant est très agréable et disponible. Possibilité de prix très interessants en fonction de la durée du sejour."
40,"Every thing you needed was right there, full kitchen, bottled water, fans in the rooms, close to the beach, close to the main strip, but far enough away that it was quite, the best.  Bonnie from the Yukon Canada"
20,"Det positiva är en fantastisk utsikt mot stranden och havet Läget är ganska centralt Ok pris Inget hotel om man vill ha en bra standard eller bra service Det byggs ett hotell bredvid som verkar bra och kan erbjuda det spm maresias saknar, trevlig hotellpersonal , härliga sängar, fräsch toalett Stefan med vuxen son"
20,"Run down, pool slimy However, the view from Room #7 was an excellent view of the ocean. There are two rooftop terraces also with excellent views of the ocean.  Near shops restaurants and bars.  Near surfing beach however you cannot swim at this beach, you haveto walk down to another beach.  A dog and cat keep hanging around my room."
20,"Die Zimmer sind sehr einfach und bereits älteren Datums. Rund 50 Meter vor der Unterkunft befindet sich ein Club, der praktisch jede Nacht laute Technomusik spielt, so dass wegen den Bässen an Schlaf nicht zu denken ist. Wir haben über booking.com reserviert und dann vor Ort bemerkt, dass es in unmittelbarer Nähe wesentlich bessere und zudem preisgünstigere Optionen gibt. Und das obschon wir über die Weihnachtszeit dort waren."
50,"Spent a couple vacations there now and I love it! There is a little courtyard in the center that really creates an amazing atmosphere. The rooms are in the castle towers..the place is just amazing, i cant say enough. "
40,"Единственный минус это только то, что этот хостель весьма сложно найти, улица маленькая, тупиковая и её мало кто знает из местных жителей. Все остальное весьма порадовало. Радушный хозяин, прекрасная кухня, до океана не спеша 5 минут ходьбы. Туалет и душевая кабина в рабочем хорошем состоянии, бесплатный вайфай имеется ))) В целом, рекомендую..."
40,"El hostel está justo frente a la playa, bastan unos cuantos pasos para cruzar la calle y estar en la hermosa playa de Zicatela. El hostel muy tranquilo, tiene piscina lo que le da puntos extra cuando en una tarde de mucho calor y después de haber caminado por horas es lo único que te refresca. La habitación muy básica, pero limpia y segura. Dani, el chico de la recepción, súper amable igual que los demás. En general un hostal muy básico con la ubicación perfecta y el personal más amable. Sin duda es un hostel que tiene mucho potencial, esperamos regresar, seguro nos sorprende."
30,"This is a nice place to stay but it is not 5 star resort.  It has a good location across the road from the beach with a nice sun deck and two nice pools.  The rooms are comfortable with TV and A/C but the hotel is certainly not the cleanest I've stayed in and the insects in this part of the world are huge!  We also had a check in mix up which was a bit painful and the English spoken at the desk was about as good as my Spanish.  We didn't dine at the restaurant but had drink service on the sundeck which adds new meaning to ""Mexican time"".  Getting the drinks was bad enough but then the wait to sign for the cheque was interminable.  One time I just left and asked them to charge my room which caused quite a stir.  Getting the wifi to work was impossible - it seemed you needed a"
40,"This is a nice hotel with great beds, air conditioning, attractive, good pools, clean, perfectly located between the zicatela and marinero beaches, and has an excellent restaurant. A few things could make it better. The internet is very slow, there are no coffee makers in the rooms, and the restaurant does not open until 7 in the morning so there is no way to get early morning coffee."
30,"The hotel is pretty but we paid for a Presidential Suite with WiFi and didn't work. Asked for support, still waiting... Also, the plants and wilderness were too long and didn't let enjoy the view. The service is great, specially considering the distance to the rooms. GREAT cooks"
40,The first night I stayed in one of the Master Suites which had a bedroom and very large living room area.  Great view of the ocean and the huge living room was very nice to hang out in.  About the only complaint I would have is the jacuzzi tub looked pretty old and ready to be replaced.  These are the only rooms with ocean views and if you can afford it they are nice.  Switched to a standard room the next two nights which was simple but fine for the price.  Only drawbacks were no coffee maker or mini fridge.  WiFi worked well in both rooms.  The restaurant is excellent.
40,"Nothing fancy, but everything nice. Considering there are no hotels On the beach in Playa Zicatela this for me and by far the best option. Restaurant has excellent food and it is not overpriced. Great swimming pool."
50,"Lovely quiet Colonial style hotel on the north end of Zicatela beach, so within easy walking do the multitude of beach restaurants on Zicatela, and easy to access the Playas Principal & Marinera and the Adoquin. The grounds and pools are immaculate and the restaurant has delicious Mexican/ Oaxacan speciatlities. THE place to have a drink and watch the sunset. I loved it!"
50,"Recently my boyfriend and I went to Puerto Escondido, which is a small layback surfers haven. We do not surf and actually my boyfriend is blind so he does not go into the sea...BUT, we still love the beach.... Hotel Santa Fe was the PERFECT spot....The property is small and cozy and the staff is so customer oriented. The view is great and the pools are wonderful.....I know we will go back to PE again...and for sure we will stay at the Hotel Santa Fe."
40,"This is probably the best hotel in Puerto Escondido. The service and location are amazing! Also, they have a really good restaurant with healthy and clean food options. Just beware of mosquitoes if you're visiting during the summer! "
30,"Nothing special here except for very friendy and accomodating staff.  The rooms need to be upgraded urgently.  Most disappointed that my A/C didn't work, making it hard to sleep.  Not pleasant to wake up wet from sweat."
40,"My granddaughter and I spent 4 days at the Santa Fe, facing the beach at Zicatela, famous for surfing. I wanted a safe, attractive place for her and remembered the Santa Fe from several stays there in the past. Our room opened onto the pool area, which was perfect for the mermaid, and the room was cool and clean. We had to wait 24 hours for hot water, but when it came it was great. We didn't mind using the same sheets and towels for several days, but we would have appreciated having clean glasses every day. Having to go outside to fill a water pither was a little inconvenient, but not a real problem. The restaurant was as nice as I remembered and we enjoyed several meals there. The impression that breakfast was included was a little disappointing in that it was only pan, cafe, y"
50,Es una posada super tranquila y la gente que atiende muy amable. Desde 2017 cambio el dueño y eso mejoro mucho la atención. Ambiente de gente sana que practica surf. Vine con mi familia (Vicky y Federica) y nos sentimos muy cómodos.
50,"Excelente lugar ,muy limpio todo, muy buen trato  ,Los encargados nuevos qué hay son muy amables y están siempre pendientes para Ayudarte en todo lo que nesesites . Volvería sin ninguna duda . Excelente relación precio calidad ."
10,"la atención está pésima!!! Súper grosera la tipa que atiende, muy prepotente. No hay agua caliente, no hay toallas ni tapetes, el internet esta pésimo, las instalaciones en general son basura para lo que cobran, no vale nada, y todavía la atención que dan muy mala... groseros, huevones, indispuestos, en fin. No se queden ahí es basura"
10,"Non so da dove iniziare. Ho prenotato una stanza tramite un'app che offriva uno sconto importante...ho comunque pagato troppo! Appena arrivato mi sono reso conto che le foto viste nell'app erano molto ma molto meglio della realtà, e bravo il fotografo; con una scusa senza né capo né coda hanno provato farmi pagare qualcosa di piú ma si sono arresi subito; non trovavano la chiave della mia stanza quindi sono stato spostato a una senza a/c; poco dopo é arrivata una mia amica e l'hanno piazzata nella stanza senza chiave (e lei sí che ha pagato di piú!) e per 24 ore le hanno fatto credere che stavano cercando la chiave; avevo serie difficoltà a comunicare con la proprietaria, e ho provato tutte le lingue del mondo!"
40,Stayed here 2 year and going back February 2021. The owners are wonderful people and we made friendships with other renters both year's. Definitely going to stay st Vills Chakaron. Thanks P & D.   Had a great time both years.
40,"El hotel es pequeño y tiene 2 niveles y con pocas habitaciones (entre 10 y 12), ideal para personas mayores ya que saliendo de la habitación estaba inmediatamente la alberca. Si vienes en plan familiar y quieres algo muy privado, este lugar es ideal. El servicio es muy bueno, todas las personas son amables. La administración fue muy flexible en cuestión de pagos y reservaciones. En la recepción tienen un refrigerador donde te pueden guardar lo que necesites. La ubicacion es muy buena por que esta sobre un boulevard con varios restaurantes muy agradables y es una zona tranquila si buscas descanso y poco ruido.Hay 2 playas que están a 5 minutos si vas en coche o a 15 minutos caminando, Solo hay algunas observaciones que espero tomen en cuenta, el sanitario cerca de la alberca"
40,"El hotel es muy pequeño, limpio y cuenta con una excelente ubicación ya que de ahí te puedes mover a pie perfectamente a cualquiera de las playas de Puerto Escondido manzanillo, puerto angelito, carrizalillo, bahia princial, bachoco (excepto  zicatela que puedes tomar un colectivo que se va por la costera esta como a 5 min en trasnporte). Es muy pulcro y no cuenta con lujos WIFI No cuenta con agua caliente (pero esta tibiesita para el calor por haya esta aceptable) Ventilador y Aire acondicionado nuevo que no hace nada de ruido La alberca esta pequeña pero muy bien para refrescarse Tiene habitaciones que cuentan con cocineta pero deberas solicitarla en la recervasion. El precio fue aceptable aun que no era temporada me comentaron que en temporada los precios suben.  El taxi"
50,"I have been to Pto. Escondido several times and out of all the hotels I have stayed in I like this one the very best. The price is great for what you get: free wifi, a pool, AC! (a must in the spring and summer heat), cable tv, and a comfy bed. It is also very quiet at night and the surrounding neighborhood is great. The rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly to me, especially the hotel manager. Any requests I had were fulfilled immediately. They have single rooms with two beds and also apartments to rent with a stove, refrigerator and microwave. There are several restaurants (all delicious), and two grocery/convenience stores less then 1 min walking time from the hotel. My favorite was Sazon de Charly right next door. It served traditional Mexican dishes that were"
10,"So disappointed with this hotel, beautiful pictures online but looked terrible when we arrived. Being exhausted and hot from out travelling, we went to ""reception"" area where some guy was sleeping on the sofa and we had to wake him up to help us. This was at 3PM in the afternoon. We showed him our reservation and our receipt as we had already wire deposited a deposit to pay for our room. After 10 minutes or so of not saying anything, we asked what was going on and he said they were going to take us to another hotel because they were having ""transformer issues"". Even though the hotel was full of people, tourists and at least 20 federal police who were ""vacationing"" in their cars and uniforms apparently. They had clearly overbooked. The other hotel was on the other side of town"
50,"Pasamos tres días hospedados de nuevo en este lugar, rentamos tres suites para estar con la familia disfrutando del clima en Puerto Escondido luego de las fiestas de fin de año.  La recepción amable y el lugar limpio. La alberca disponible para refrescarte desde el momento en que te registras y al volver de la playa. Nos encanta que esté tan cerca de Carrizalillo y el Cafecito, podemos desayunar y luego ajar a la playa caminando en menos de 15 minutos estás en la playa desde el hotel.  Las suites limpias, cuentan con ropa de cama y toallas, cada uno puede ocuparse con hasta 4 personas, tienen dos habitaciones, en una hay una cama matrimonial y la otra cuenta con dos camas individuales, cocina con estufa y refrigerador incluido, además de platos, vasos, cubiertos y otros"
50,"Llegamos a Puerto Escondido en Semana Santa sin una reservación, con la promesa de una habitación en un hotel al cual llegamos y tuvimos que salir corriendo, de vuelta hacia Zicatela nos encontramos con estas suites que por fuera no nos decían mucho, pero decidimos que no costaba nada preguntar. Alquilamos una suite por una noche por un buen precio, considerando que en esta época es muy difícil encontrar una habitación disponible.  Las suites son amplias, la cocina muy bien equipada con todo lo necesario para cocinar y almacenar alimentos, la barra es perfecta para las comidas informales de las vacaciones, la sala es amplia y cuenta con una pantalla de gran tamaño, aunque es un poco calurosa uno no va a la playa para pasar mucho tiempo mirando la televisión.  Las habitaciones"
50,"Si bien es un hotel que tenga todas las comodidades, se compensa con la atenció, amabilidad y solucion de problemas que te dan los que ahi laboran. Su retauarante es aceptable. Y ahi mismo venden los boletos para viajar de oaxaca a puerto escondido y viceversa."
50,Visited this restaurant and had lunch and drinks on the terrace which was situated along a short walkway. Wonderful location with the sea surrounding the terrace. Staff were welcoming and very attentive. Choice and quality of food and drinks were first class. A thoroughly enjoyable experience and we are now planning a short break in the hotel.
10,"Te dan números de cuenta incorrectos para depositarles y después resulta que no les depositaste a ellos, no acepten depositarles por anticipado porque no te reconocen los pagos, deberían de auditar a esta empresa"

50,"I travel quite lot and that was absolutely the best hostel I ever staid in, very close to the beach, simple but cozy rooms, very nice equipped kitchen. and lovely people:) totally recommended! great thanks to the owners"
50,"I visited them on september and the weather was very nice.  Mark and Luis (the owners) are great guys. The Hostel is nice, the bathrooms are very clean (important) and the beach is just few steps away.  It is amazing that is a great place but still very cheap and with great people.  For all the surfers this is the place."
20,"El lugar es lindo, tiene piscina, lugar para cocinar, hamacas paraguayas. El personal de la noche es el personal de mantenimiento y nada más! Muy estricto con las normas: Como prohibir usar los espacios comunes después de las 23:00 horas y si no te vas, te apagan la luz.  Muy mala actitud por parte del personal !!Nos pasó también que no tuvimos agua caliente por un día hasta que nos la encendieron porque un botón andaba mal. También cuando íbamos a cocinar faltó una vez el gas y tuvimos que esperar a que pongan el tanque. También el viento apagaba las hornallas para cocinar.  "
50,"Hicimos viaje en pareja, el hotel es perfecto!  Excelente servicio de todo el personal, en recepción Andréa... Lucy de limpieza, siempre súper linda y amable!  La verdad es que si quieres pasar unas excelentes vacaciones.. la Playita es súper recomendable.  La cocina esta increíblemente hermosa y limpia para cocinar todo lo que tú quieras.. el refrigerador está separado por cuarto.  La alberca está deliciosa y súper limpia. Tiene espacios para estar agusto al sol o con sombra.  Excelente locación para ir al mercado que está arriba y también cruzando está la playa.  El lugar es súper silencioso ya que no aceptan niños ✨♥️  Somos fan de este lugar! Es garantía regresar.  Súper recomendable "
40,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and really enjoyed it. It's quiet and just on the edge of the main Zicatela strip with restaurants and bars (5-10 min walk), but in a quieter area for getting good sleep. You can also want to Punta along the beach in about 25-30 minutes. The grounds are beautiful and well-designed with a good size pool and lots of lounging areas. Drinking water is readily available to refill your bottle and a shared kitchen is there if you like cooking. The staff is hands-off but friendly if there is anything you need. We booked a good whale-watching tour through them.   The rooms are basic but have a nice design and are relatively comfortable. The shower pressure was pretty weak in our room though, so that could be improved. It was also very hot the week we"
50,"Just on board of Zicatela, but at walkable distance to the center, this enjoyable surf house is very nice and extremely clean. Recently renovated, the rooms have modern en-suite bathroom, minimal  but comfortable furniture, they own veranda. The courtyard with a small swimming pool and the beautiful common kitchen/living area add something special during your stay. The staff is always friendly and available for any request and info you need. We couldn’t choose a better place in Zicatela!  "
20,"The rooms are clean and spacious, the bed linen was clean, and that about all that's good that I can say about it.  Some of the rooms are air-conditioned, and some are not. I got a room that was not. There was a lot of traffic noise from the street. I tried to deal with this by closing the window, and the window wouldn't close. The hotel staff couldn't close it, either. I could have read a newspaper through the towels. The main thing here is, there are much better hotels in Puerto Escondido for less money."
40,"Hotel barato, habitación grande, en verdad para dormir es muy bueno casi no hay ruido de carros, un lugar con opciones cercas para comer o cenar, playa tambien bastante cerca, en cuestión de TV, solo cuenta con tres canales abiertos. Recomendable para pasar la noche entre calidad y precio. "
50,"Solo venimos de paso pero nos sorprendió la amabilidad de los de recepción y aunque no tienen estacionamiento y pudimos dejar los autos afuera, ellos hasta buscaron una casa particular para dejarlos y así no preocuparnos, el hotel está muy cerca de restaurantes, cafeterías, tiendas, etc. Muy recomendado, las habilitaciones limpias, volvería a este lugar"
50,"Stayed here with two little ones and found the rooms very spacious with everything we needed for a great beach holiday. Excellent location close to many cafes, big supermarket and anything else the hotel was happy to call a cab for us (very cheap rides to anywhere in town and the many beaches). Staff very very helpful with ideas on breakfast and rooms very always cleaned when we came back. Free WiFi was a great bonus too. Can’t beat the value of the place and can’t wait to come back to visit again when the kids can start learning to surf."
50,"Hotel with great service and staff super friendly and helpful, my home in Puerto. The hotel is super clean and rooms are big and the WiFi is great. The location is another superb bonus. The staff helped us and gave us local hints. Thank you"
30,"Pues la comida si es en gran proporción pero las bebidas son demaciadas caras, el servicio es un poco lento. Adicional es un lugar tranquilo cerca del centro y aveces voy a cenar, también venden cervezas. Cabe mencionar que no me hospede ahí   "
40,"It's an economic hotel, so there are compromises like the space in the room and bathroom. But you get what you pay for and that's ok. There's safe parking behind the hotel, the reception overlooking most of the parking lot.  A recommendation for travel on a budget!"
50,"Bien ubicado muy cerca de la bahía principal de puerto escondido y del mercado Benito Juárez, sencillo pero limpio y muy económico sólo $400 por noche con dos camas matrimoniales, sólo le hace falta una alberca"
50,A new hotel on Zicatela beach in Puerto Escondido.  Hosts are very knowlegable and friendly.  Centrally located in terms of beach and nearby restaurants where amazingly fresh sea food is available.  Puerto Escondido is an amazing placr to visit.
50,Una excelente opcion de hospedaje en Brisas de Zicatela.  5 pequeños bungalows de estilo boutique. 4 con tina de hidromasaje.  Dos bonitas terrazas con vista al mar. Una de ellas con tina de hidromasaje.  
50,"We found this place driving using maps.me and ended up stuck in a river outside of the hostel at midnight. The lovely owners came out and helped us get the car out which took a lot of work to do! Learn from us and stick to the mapped roads ! Their accommodation is simple but nice - they have floating dorm beds and a private rooms. They bent over backwards to help us out!  They are still making the place a proper hostel but if you can stay there, you should ! "
50,"es un buen lugar para hospedarse sencillo y cerca de l paya seguro  también es un barrio muy agradable pero lo mejor lo mejor es el restaurante, esto vale la pena en verdad debes de comer aquí usan ingredientes prehispánicos con técnicas modernas y el resultado es maravilloso ...  muy bueno en verdad"
50,"Solid food! Solid service! Great Atmosphere!  We had a party of 15 and food came out quick and delicious.  Views of the beach with open air restaurant, but a strong AC!  Bacon was crisp and smoky, Parmesian Sandwich was killer, omelets were filling, and the French toast was thick and delicious, and much more!  We will surely come back!"
50,"Every time I go to Puerto Escondido I stay at the Luna Rosa, is perfectly located, people there are very sweet and attentive, it has the best view of the beach and if you're lucky you can book one of the two private rooms in the place. I really like that they give you your own key so you can come and go and the fact that you have access to the pool of the hotel next door."
40,"The girls and myself decided to go to Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca to see the little town and meet some hot surfers...it turn out to be the best vacation ever!  After arriving in Puerto Escondido, we decided to look for a Hostel in the main road - Zicatela - we found Luna Rosa (in our guide it mentioned that had great terraces) and since the entrance we felt the good vibes of it. The new owner - Elena - received us with a big smile and a lot of great recomendations! Right away we stayed on a little corner in the comfortable dorm and felt at home.  We had the most fun days and met a lot of people!  The Hostel used to be only for women...but now men are also allowed. It is very spacious, with big terraces overlooking the beach. Upstairs there are private rooms and a fully equipped"
40,"This is an economy hotel, I paid 250 pesos ($14 at current exchange rate of 18 pesos/1 USD). At this price I got an economical room with decent wifi, good AC & ceiling fan, secure parking and cleanish room. The bed was actually decent. I stayed in room #10 on the 1st floor and I could park my car right in front of the room which made it easy to unload/load. There's a small (13""?) TV with 70 or so channels, most of them obviously spanish but I could find a few channels that showed some things in English some in Spanish. The beach out front is popular with Mexicans. Between the beach and the hotel is a runoff/lagoonish area that wasn't so clean. I saw some people wading through it but I probably wouldn't. You could walk around it to access the beach. Even though I didn't do it,"
40,"Agradable estancia en puerto escondido, sobre todo que no fue temporada alta, cerca del adoquinado y de la playa. No sin anterior pasar a lagunas de chacahua, posterior fuimos a mazunte, y playa manzanillo. Todo muy rico."
40,"Es un hotelito muy barato y está decente, la habitación es pequeña pero suficiente para pasar una noche. Tiene T.V con cable, baño privado y agua caliente, además está en una buena ubicación. La gente es muy amable y servicial. Lo recomiendo si no se espera un hotel de gran lujo."
50,"Atención increíble!! Limpieza inmejorable y ambiente familiar al cien porciento, está en el centro de puerto a unas calles del mercado, el mejor lugar para tener una experiencia local, con alberca y cerca del mar "

40,We stayed at Casa Piedra for almost a month. We found the location worked really well for us. Coral and Axel do an excellent job keeping the hotel running smoothly. They are wonderful people. The rooms are basic but functional. A/C was very helpful. This hotel is located amidst some great restaurants and close to about 40 more. The pool was a welcome addition for cooling off and was always clean and the right temperature. The downside was it was on THE up road from Zacatel and there is a lot of traffic noise. The plus side is you never had to wait long for a taxi. This property has some great common areas to relax.
40,"Excelente ubicación, a unos 200 metros de la Playa de Zicatela y de una buena zona de restaurantes donde puedes encontrar todo tipo de comida. Precios accesibles y justos por sus habitaciones, las cuales son espaciosas. Limpio."
50,"Disfrute de la estancia en este hotel muy buen servicio de los empleados, recomendable, precios accesibles, muy bien las habitaciones, los baños limpios y buena calidad de los ventiladores y el clima debo repetir lo del buen servicio 100/100"
40,"La estancia fue placentera, un excelente servicio y trato por los empleados desde la llegada hasta la salida, el único detalle fue que no cuenta con estacionamiento, de ahí en fuera todo lo demás está excelente."
50,"Beautiful cabanas surrounded by all sorts of trees, fruit plants and cactus. The rooms are clean, comfortable and designed to make the most of the ocean breeze (important for the heat of April/May). The common area is great to play board games, meet people or chill out in the hammocks. The kitchen is well stocked and has filtered water to fill up your water bottle. It's located on a quiet street 2 minutes from shops, bars and restaurants. Also 2 minutes from the beach with a great point break. It's very affordable and Jorge, the owner makes you feel right at home. I would highly recommend staying here!"
50,"I am acupuncturist registered with the Sanctuary.  I was bitten by the chikongunya virus mosquito .....and at age 67 I thought it might be the end.......I wrote an email to the Sanctuary head, Peter John Adams, and he rushed over to my house with the MMS protocol treatment.  I recivered in like 12 hours or so....but felt better immediately.  Peter has a heart of gold and  I am quite sure he saved my life.  There are some real healers at the Sanctuary....cant recommend it highly enough."
50,"If you're in Puerto Escondido, Aloe Cabañas is a must! It's affordable, clean and very comfortable! The location is awesome, down a quiet road just a couple of minutes walk from the beach and top surfing spot, La Punta. The owners, Jorge and Valerie, are just fantastic. They are so helpful, generous and so great to talk with! We had such a good time with them, they really made our stay in Puerto so enjoyable. There is also an open kitchen area which is clean and a really nice place for meals and to chat with other guests. This place is really a home away from home. I'd go back in a heartbeat."
50,"This place is about process, healing, finding yourself, and eating super healthy and tasty food. Just walking distance of 3 minutes from the ocean and really clean house, with great people and amazing space to practice yoga on the roof. I give the sanctuary 5 stars!!"
10,La sra Olga da un pésimo servicio no te deja usar alberca apesar de que dio un horario a última hora no respeto lo que dijo nos cobro mas de lo que dice en sus referencias aparte de todo grosera hace sentir que te esta haciendo un favor al hospedarte ahí se molestaba por todo y todo el tiempo nos cuidaba
50,"We stayed at the Santa Fe Hotel the week of Jun 17 - 21 and it was GREAT! Location is THE BEST in PE, staff is cordial and attentive (Sonia...thanks for your assistance) and other than the fact that there was only ¨warm¨ water in the shower (who needs hot water with the great weather :), everything at the hotel was wonderful....spacy and confy rooms, great restaurant and unmatched views!! Definitely be back....hopefully very soon! Frank O."
10,"Muy mal la actitud de la señora Olga, súper despota y grosera (parece que te regala la estancia) no nos dejó usar las instalaciones (cocina), nos estuvo presionando todo el tiempo por el ruido (risas). Las habitaciones tienen hormigas por todos lados, más en los baños. Si van a hospedarse, mejor búsquenlo en aplicación ya que si llegas directamente te da el precio que ella quiere."
50,"De viaje con amigos y de manera improvisada llegamos a este pequeño paraíso dentro de puerto escondido. Nada más llegar para preguntar precios la acogida fue fantástica, y aunque no hemos pasado una temporada tan larga como otro huéspedes ya puedo decir que Mamá Olga es una persona fiel a sus valores y con una humanidad exquisita. Su hotelito, sin ser pretencioso, es un lugar mágico donde relajarte, convivir y conocerte a ti mismo. Cuidan todos los detalles, es limpio, cómodo y muy atento. Si buscas estar en contacto con el lugar y con la gente definitivamente este es el sitio. Por lo menos a sido el mío y siempre que pueda volveré! Me he sentido como en casa y siempre estará en mi corazón!"
50,"Vinimos dos parejas en temporada baja a puerto escondido, enero'17.  El precio muy conveniente y con rebaja.  La acogida por Mamá Olga y Don Hugo fue excepcional, cálida, familiar. Buenas y animadas conversaciones con ellos que nos hacían sentir de la mejor y más placentera manera. Al ladito de la playa, habitaciones amplias. 3 plantas con dos habitaciones en cada una.   Olvídate del tv gracias a dios.  La limpieza como norma fundamental de la casa. Piscina amplia al aire libre. Hamaca por cada habitación. Cocina al aire libre. Baños individuales con una ducha tan grande como un salón.  El paraíso tiene nombre y se llama Casa Olga.  Mamá Olga, Don Hugo, volveremos y gracias. "
50,"Un lugar increíble, la gente te hace sentir como en familia, encuentras el descanso deseado, cerca de la playa, buena comida y los cuartos demasiado limpios. Todo es un paraíso, gracias mamá Olga y Don Hugo siempre por todo."
50,"Definitivamente el espacio ideal si lo que buscas es tener privacidad y limpieza. Casa Olga nos dio la bienvenida, buscamos por toda la avenida principal sin éxito por nuestros gustos personales, desde el momento de la atención directa y amable, nos gano para quedarnos, aunado a la impecable limpieza del lugar, una alberca grande para 6 habitaciones a diferencia de albercas pequeñas en grandes hoteles. Simplemente nuestro lugar favorito en Playa Zicatela. Volveremos!"
50,"Grande chambre avec salle de bain, très propre, lit confortable, hamac sur la terrasse pour profiter de l'océan et de la piscine. Très agréable, une cuisine extérieure super bien équipée, tout est très bien entretenu. Transat à dispo,wifi et lecture.  Les hôtes sont sympathiques et répondent à toutes vos questions, prêts à vous aider. Un couple de mexicain comme on les aime !"
40,"I was in Pto Escondido Feb17-24/15. It was a pleasant Father- Grown-Up Daughter get away. I was in Escondido 42 years before when it was an isolated 2 street tiny fishing village. My daughter was last there studying Spanish 5 years ago when she stayed with Olga and her husband. The 4 rooms are 1/2 way up the hill from Zicatella Beach with great views from very wide spacious ocean breezy balconies.  There are 2 rooms on each floor. The pool is small, clean and in a very pretty sunny garden. The beach is a 3 minute walk away as are all kinds of eateries, bars, etc. Olga's is at the quiet end of the town. Puerto Escondido remains a mainly Mexican laid back surfer's resort with a fair sprinkling  of ex-pats/ sunbirds and rare package tourists who stay in Huatulco 2 hours by car"
40,The property is well maintained with a small pool and communal kitchen.  Had third floor accommodations which boasted a beautiful sunset and relaxing hammocks for an afternoon siesta.  Rooms and property are absolutely spotless.  Olga is a darling little Mexican lady who speaks English well and is most accommodating.
50,"Olga's Place is a pleasant getaway in quiet location off the main drag of Zicatela Beach. Spotless rooms offering beautiful oceanview of palm trees from our relaxing hammocks on 3rd floor. Good sized pool & rooms, exterior kitchen area. Some rooms have kitchen suites. Very accommodating to the 4 of us. We felt extremely comfortable with our gracious hosts. Very reasonable per night at 450 pesos. Free wi-fi was nice. Olga is a sweetheart!"
20,"Have stayed at the Santa Fe probably ten times over a 20 year period. It used to be reliably perfect.  Unfortunately the current office management is rigid and unresponsive.  The hotel no longer provides mini fridges, which are essential in the warm climate to feel you have a home away from home. Other lower budget hotels in PE provide fridges without hesitation. The room we had pre-booked was not available, we were told b/c the toilet wasn't working...so we were place in a smaller room with a small balcony. Although the hotel was almost empty, we were unable to get a more spacious room. On our last trip (November 2012) we could not convince the staff to provide hot water for our shower. The non-management staff are friendly, warm, and kind. There is a sense that no funds are"
50,"I've just returned from another excellent stay at the Santa Fe in Puerto Escondido.  I always count myself fortunate to be able to vacation at the Santa Fe, as it is truly the best place in this part of the world.  Gracefully constructed, it is a place of beauty and serenity, which expresses a refined version of Old Mexico.  The variety of rooms are all airy and full of light, with air conditioning and ceiling fans, doors opening onto balconies, and decorated with native crafts, such as bark paintings, rugs and embroideries.  The staff, who dress in the beautiful garments of Oaxaca, are always welcoming and accommodating.  And one eats well at the Santa Fe!  The menu, which offers healthy and delicious food, includes fish and seafood, with many vegetarian choices.   Two swimming"
50,"Probably on the pricy side for P.E. but sooo worth it.  Rooms are beautiful and with AC.  The staff is beyond attentive.  The restaurant and food is absolutely outrageous.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all equally awesome.  The view, pools and grounds are also fantastic.    Go to this hotel.  You won't be sorry."
50,"We have stayed at Hotel Santa Fe now for ten years and it truly is our home away from home.  This year, we stayed just over six weeks.  The hotel staff provides excellent, professional service and they are accommodating, welcoming and warm, having become friends whom we miss when we leave.  Many have been there for all ten years we've visited.  The location is ideal, right on the ocean and within easy walking distance of many shops, restaurants and with great beach access.  The restaurant provides the most consistently high-quality food in Puerto and offers a terrific ocen view.  Most foods are made in house and many with organic ingredients.  I agree with another reviewer that the margaritas (served by Juan) are the best ever! The grounds (lush and green) and pools are well"
40,"Although it is a little expensive compared to other hotels in Puerto, it is in general worth it if you're looking to relax within a beautiful environment. The restaurant is excellent. Very good service and quality food. The entire atmosphere has got a very good taste. Swimming pools, terrace, gardens, etc, everything is very nice and well taken care of. One of the best things is the location, a few steps from Zicatela's beach !! Where we could see some improvement is in the rooms. Some things were not working, like the screen door was not closing tight and the fan on the roof was swinging dangerously. Also, for the price, the amenities in the room are not what someone would expect. They could without a problem invest a little more in better soaps and shampoo bottles. But it was"
50,The place to stay in P.E Not cheap but worth every peso! Amazing view from the restaurant. Excellent service especially the two waiters who have been there for decades I like the tortilla soup with fresh baked bread two pools with one just for adults take the lagoon tour  eat with locals in town at Las Margaritas La Tour Eiffel in Rinconada is also a must
30,"In March 2012 10 of us stayed for two nights here and enjoyed the hotel, the restaurant, the great location right across from the beach, with clean silky sand and gorgeous water. The pools at the hotel are in tranquil, tropical settings tucked away from the public. The hotel has lots of beautiful tiles, comfortable furniture, decent service, healthy food, but the rooms are kind of basic. There is nothing special about the beds, linens, amenities, air conditioner that moved warm air around, tv not necessary unless you speak spanish, and bugs that bite. The rooms were a decent size and clean but dark. Many places in Mexico have dim lighting so bring a head lamp for reading! It is a very relaxing atmosphere, lots of shopping on the Main Street with cafes and clothing, art and"
50,"We returned to the Hotel Santa Fe after more than 15 years and were not disappointed. The rooms and grounds are, if anything, better with the charming atmosphere of an old Mexican hacienda complete with shady swimming pools. We had a standard room which was adequate, but would consider a second floor in the adjacent hotel bungalows, which are just as economical. The hotel still serves great seafood and vegetarian dishes, and the view of the wild Zicatela Beach provides a wonderful contrast to the comfortable elegance of the restaurant. In the mornings we enjoyed walks on Zicatela, and in the evenings we enjoyed the sunset from the neighbouring Playa Marinero. The hotel straddles both beaches, and the road between hotel and beaches is little more than a path. We tooks cabs to"
40,"We arrive on this really nice looking hotel, which is few steps away from the beach. We were five, so we got a Lobby Cabin really spacious and close to the pool.   Our only issue was that the cabin was infested with dead bees all over the floor, it seems that the cabin was recently fumigated but not cleaned. We informed the hotel staff and they came really quickly to clean it up and to fumigate it a really bit ""just in case"". They offered us another room while we waited, which it was really nice.   After that, everything was really good! Excellent location and really nice food around. Maybe just a little expensive for my taste.  Restaurant Tip: The restaurant just in front the hotel has an espectacular fried fish."
50,"I stayed here for two weeks and its such a great environment. The place is set up very well and  the bunk beds are comfortable.  The owner is really cool too. Very young, responsible and nice. The beach is also walking distance. Highly recommend I must add that i was able to do a few different fun excursions for very cheap through the hostel. Its very fun here."
50,Cheap rates Tasty Pancakes with fruits for breakfast Great location next to bus station and close to all the local restaurants Double bed with a fan WiFi Bathroom Beautiful rooftop with a great view Understanding and helpful owner What more could I ask for?  Extended my stay and would definitely stay again.
20,"Nos hospedamos allí una noche, cuando llegamos de Oaxaca, porqué se encuentra cerca de donde nos dejó la sprinter. Aunque era temporada baja no había prácticamente nadie. Es un sitio muy dejado y sucio. Nuestra habitación daba a la cocina y daba la sensación de poca intimidad. Ponían la musica alta y se escuchaba por todo el hostel. Cama en muy mal estado, los muelles del colchón se notaban un montón. No volvería."
50,"A wonderful restaurant and hostel in the heart of Puerto Escondido's most authentic area. Mario the owner will personally ensure that your time in Puerto is unforgettable, bestowing upon his guests the wealth of knowledge he has gained over the last several decades. Highly recommend. "
50,"This place for the money is the best your gunna get in Puerto Escondido. It's more of a hotel but without hotel prices. The location is right on the end of the Main Street which sits you in between town and Zicatela beach. The owner is friendly and fare and they have a good Italian restaurant in front. I would highly recommend this place   Lewis, UK"
20,"The rooms were very basic, the bed sheets were thin and the bed uncomfortable. The shower was so bad, there was no pressure whatsoever. There was only one working PowerPoint in a room for four people.  The plus sides are the WIFI was incredibly fast and the stff were nice, not to mention the pizza restaurant downstairs is easily the best pizza I've ever had and the waiter was the kindest ever!! "
40,"Basic hostel but clean, cheap and 2 mins from main swimming beach (which is not small at all) Good value  Room size ok Courtyard was nice for chilling out Owners very friendly and helpful Food in restaurant is excellent Was quite noisy at night from bars nearby but I think everywhere on that side of town would be noisy"
20,"Let me say firstly that the city is great.  The beach is pretty small, and there are lots of fun and charming places to eat or drink around there.  The neighborhood is right by the main beach, so that is good.  The owner also was very nice.  We ate in his restaurant and he empathized with us about the horrible bus trip from Oaxaca City.  And the food was not bad.  But in terms of security, anyone could kick in the door and steal everything from the room.  The room wasn't horrible, but it is very primitive  If you can get over the 'oh my god, we're staying here???"" first impression, it's not bad at all.  But I am certain there are much better options out there if you don't reserve at the last second like we did.  Neighborhood is very noisy also, so you either need to get drunk"
50,"Great Value place to stay, right near the beach and main strip. Rooms are a decent size, owners are super freindly and welcolming, If your looking for some great Italian food, head next door, their Spaghetti bolognaise is one of the best I've had!"
30,"The rooms are very basic, no extras at all. The bed was a little soft at one side and the fan was a bit noisy. Good value for money though. For great food, especially fish dishes, go to nearby restaurant Pascale! We went there three times and every time it was amazing. "
40,"Super friendly father and son duo running this hotel/hostel/Italian restaurant. Very conveniently located to the main part of Puerto Escondido, restaurants and port side beach. About a 20 minute walk to Zicatela...so not ideal for surfers! We stayed one night in a private double - and we're upgraded due to them renovating the front stairs (it was low season). The restaurant serves up italian fare which was a nice change from Mexican delicacies and Mario, the owner, was full of stories about PE in bygone times. Very good value for money! "
30,"Staff were attentive, friendly and helpful.  Our room was basic, old and tired but kept very clean. It was fine for what we needed.  The location is pretty good too.  I would stay here again if on a budget."
40,"The place was great, we just came back from our five day stay at Monte Cassino and for 15 dollars a day we couldn´t have asked for more... It is a few minutes from the beach, it has a great italian restaurant and the owner has very welcoming!!! He even sat with us in the restaurant and had great stories about the town and living in Puerto.  I would recommend the place 100% to anyone who is looking for a nice, clean and cheap accommodation in Puerto."
50,Todo muy bien el servicio exelente Janette nos atendió muy bien en el cumple Demi esposa muchas grasias  todo de exelente calidad muy amable  si regresaría otra  vez  grasias x todo lo increíble q nola pasamos grasias
30,"La calidad del descanso es muy buena incluso teniendo en mente que está sobre una avenida mediana y enfrente del mercado municipal, lo cual hace que esté muy céntrico. En el mercado municipal encontrarás de todo: comida, ropa, artesanías, condimentos y más. En la alrededores hay negocios como el chocolate mayordomo, Elektra, farmacias, rosticerías, panaderías, restaurantes y más.  Las habitaciones son de tamaño regular, muy limpias siempre, con ventilador y televisión. Agua caliente y hacen el aseo a buena hora. El personal muy amable, atento y educado, siempre con una sonrisa para el huésped, el precio es bueno, considerando lo céntrico y que fui en temporada alta. Los puntos que juegan en contra es que no tiene alberca y está lejos de la playa incluso para ir a pie. Además de"
40,"La entrada no te dice mucho pero una vez que ya entras al hotel se ve todo más despejado y lindo. Los cuartos están limpios y las personas a cargo son muy amables y serviciales. El aire acondicionado funciona fantástico y la televisión también. La ubicación es en pleno centro (frente al mercado), no tan cerca de la playa si no tienes auto pero igual Puerto Escondido no es grande entonces no hay mucho problema. Por el precio está perfecto, y tienen estacionamiento lo cual ayuda bastante."
50,"I stayed here in August 2019 for a week, and the service and location was awesome.  The thing about Risas is that it´s only a 4-minute walk to the main (mini) drag of the Punta, and at the same time it´s calm and peaceful and away from all the bustle."
50,"Been staying here for a month now as a temporary solution due to problems with the house we rented. Then we decided to prolong the stay with another 4 months due to Risas del sol being just perfect. Me and a friend is sharing a 2 bedroom-apartment with kitchen and living room outside. No problems with bugs due to a nice breeze from the sea,  and the garden is beautiful and very well kept. The family that runs the place is extremely nice and will always fix any problems at a moments notice if needed. There is a pool that's fairly well sized and the walk to the beach is done in 5 minutes. Parts of La Punta may be a bit noisy due to bars and parties, but Risas del sol is just the right amount of distance from the beach and the bars so that you won't notice any noise when you are"
50,"Went here with some friends from Norway and had a beatiful stay. If you are several people you can rent rooms with several bedrooms and the biggest appartement has an own pool just beside. The outside kitchen and ""living area"" is a nice touch and with no mosquitos or insects you can enjoy your evening outside. 100m from the hotel there are several restaurants and a nice bar called ""s.o.s"". The staff is really friendly and we felt home the first day."
50,"Excelente para descansar, buen servicio y buena atencion, muy confortable, amplio, con estacionamiento y wifi, muy recomendable para negocios o familia, cercano a la bahia principal y a restaurantes, economico y centrico."
50,"Un hotel muy limpio, acogedor y muy céntrico. La atención del personal es muy bueno, no es caro ya que pagas por todos los servicios que te ofrecen. Tiene una vista espectacular hacia la playa. Muy bien el hotel"
40,"Estuvimos una semana. Es muy cómodo, luminoso. Tenes todo lo que se necesita para cocinar. Ellos ponen el agua de bidón. Muy tranquilo. Esta a tres cuadras del mar y de la callecita principal. La calle es un poco oscura pero eso es un tema municipal. La verdad que es un lugar para recomendar. Volveremos sin dudarlo. Gracias la pasamos hermoso "
50,"Nos hospedamos con amigos para semana santa en ese lugar y esta muy bonito, muy limpio, salvo el problema con las hormigas si se deja comida a fuera.  La ubicacion es excelente, esta a dos calles de la palaya y de la calle principal."
50,"Todos los servicios son de 1era. Todo se encuentra muy limpio y bien decorado. Muy serviciales para lo que se les ofrezca a los huéspedes.  Excelentes personas con las que se convive ahí. Las mejores vistas del atardecer y de las grandes olas del mar. Muy cerca del mar, a solo dos cuadritas caminando. Encuentras todo tipo de comida. ya sea local o internacional. La gastronomía es muy variada, saludable y sabrosa Realmente ahí si se descansa y se vive en paz y armonía."
50,"Puerto Escondido is a great vacation spot, very lay back and surf dude. This rental we had for a month was really great. The pictures didn't even capture the beauty of the place. Don't get fooled by the dirt road and remoteness of the place. inside the view (especially the 2nd floor) is fantastic, the space is enormous for 2 and very confortable for 4. It is charming and elegant, confortable without being pretentious. They have a lot of taste. The patio is sooooo big with 2 hammocks. There is also a terrasse on the roof where you can look at the sun set every night. The swimming pool is small but perfect for a quick dip. One critique: the kitchen supply could be a bit more elaborate, it is a bit less than the essential, especially if you plan to cook, bring a good knife. If you"
50,Stayed in the house. Amazing huge rooms.  King size beds. Full kitchen to use. Great hosts. Colin and Harry making everyone feel welcome and help out with advice. Apartments which are en suite with their own kitchen. Absolutely amazing. An a great pool. 
50,"Amazing place to unwind, close the beach, with great hosts in Harry, Emily and Anna, and unlimited home grown coconuts for breakfast and cocktails. Excellent pool to float around in, and we had some great day trips to other beaches, and a bizarrely entertaining turtle museum. Can't recommend enough."
50,"Casa Bonita is 1 block to the beach; circumferenced by shops, a variety of food options, and convenience stores within less than a minute to a few minutes walking; 3 blocks to many restaurants and bars at La Punta; 1 block to yoga in the morning; and it's dead central location between the highway and the town at La Punta means everything is close, accessible, but the property is still quiet. Even proper grocery / fruits and vegetables shopping is now available at fair prices in La Punta.   The property attracts great people. Relaxed, positive vibes. I stayed over 2 months and very very impressed. There is a lot of room to spread out, to be quiet or social at any time of day, with your group or with new friends - to make dinners, or share a few cocktails with a sunset view over"
50,"El hotel se encuentra a 10 minutos en auto del aeropuerto de puerto escondido. Las habitaciones son agradables, la más básica no cuenta con aire acondicionado pero puedes buscar otra habitación con un costo adicional para incluirlo. Tiene agua caliente, limpieza diaria en las habitaciones. El precio es accesible relacionado al beneficio que tienes para hospedarte en el puesto que se encuentra exactamente en playa zicatela a unos pasos del mar. El personal es amable. Lo único a mejorar son las cortinas puesto que entra mucho la luz del sol y aveces para quedar durmiendo hasta tarde no ayuda mucho. Lo recomiendo !!! "
30,"We booked Casa Soliz as we are always seeking to find new small/boutique hotels that we enjoy. Unfortunately, in this case this hotel did not match the 5.0/exceptional rating it promises in the travel web page we used.   It’s ok to be basic, but don’t use that as an excuse for poor quality in the build out or horrible pillows. Sound proving into and from rooms is almost non-existing, which does not allow for privacy or  a restful sleep. On the positive side, though, its got a great location and pricing is reasonable.  In sum, in my view the rating should me more in the 3.0 range, but would never qualify as a 5.0 in my book."
50,"casa soliz est très bien situé. les chambres sont propres et spacieuses. L'établissement est doté d'une piscine arborée. luis, le gérant est d'une aide précieuse pour l'organisation des activités possibles à Puerto Escondido.il est disponible et bienveillant.  Foncez!"
50,"Nous avons passé une semaine complète à la Casa Soliz. L'établissement est tout neuf, et les hôtes sont super bienveillants. Luis et son équipe, ont été d'une aide précieuse tout au long de notre séjour. Les chambres sont d'une propreté irréprochable. Highly recommended."
50,"It's a wonderful family run hotel with two fabulous kitchen units on the top floor. 7000 pesos a month (about $350usd at the time of this writing) includes all utilities, plus propane for the stove and wifi. I like cooking my own meals and the kitchen is set up well for it, with a fridge, dishes, pots and pans, cups and utensils. A big supermarket is a 10 min walk away. The fantastic ocean and beach views stretch the entire two miles from Playa Principal all the way to La Punta. Never got tired of that buena vista! It's very quiet at night and super safe and secure. Gisela is the matriarch of the family and has owned the hotel since about 1970. Many of her 8 children and grandchildren live there as well. All are extremely friendly and nice. Her youngest son was crowned 8 times"
50,Great time ...had a death in the family because this pandemic - decided to walk on the beach and it helped me. Great beach . I don't have two hundred letters for a review because its sweet and simple - I had a great time there and this beach was part of that great time.
50,"Die Stimmung in diesem Hostel ist sehr gut und auch alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind in geringer Distanz erreichbar. Wir waren 7 Tage in diesem Hostel und können es nur weiterempfehlen. Das Preis- / Leistungsverhältnis ist bestens. Die Mitarbeitenden sind gleich wie Freunde und man lernt alle sehr schnell kennen. Auch der Gastgeber gibt den Gästen nützliche Tipps und kommt auf Ausflüge, welche alle (natürlich freiwillig) gemeinsam unternehmen, mit. Im Doppelzimmer ist das Bett bequem. Natürlich kann man ein Hostel nicht mit einem 4* Hotel vergleichen, muss man aber auch garnicht. "
50,"Would highly recommend this stay for people looking for a more low key, welcoming, atmosphere that makes you feel at home. From the moment I arrived, the owner couple went out of their way to provide us with restaurant and activity recommendations, making sure we had everything we needed at the property, and overall created a really relaxing vibe. Common areas were spacious to escape for some relaxing time, but entry way was where everyone came to meet and hang out. A little bit of a walk to the beach (12 or so minutes) but close to so many wonderful restaurants. Highly recommend this option for all types of people-"
50,"Together with a friend of mine we stayed at Villa Mango for just a few days, but we really enjoyed our time there (and the free Yoga classes!). It felt like home, more like being part of a family than just a guest. The hostel is full of lovely details, and the owners make sure that you get every information regarding what to do in and around Puerto Escondido. We highly recommend Villa Mango!"
50,"A friend in Acapulco recommended this place, I have to say it was such a great experience, right from the off... Stayed a few extra days due to it being so nice... Its in a great location and at the time I was there had a great mix of people. The staff were really nice and helpful and the facilities were perfect... The common area is really nice with some hammocks around the place and for sun set its just a short stroll out onto the beach... For surfers (with experience) the waves are pretty good aswell, Bit big for myself so I went to another beach about 10/15 mins away in a taxi. Had a great time in Puerto Escondido and if I was going back I'd stay here again!"
50,"Great owners - French brothers, great location - right on the beach covered with big palm trees for all day shade, surf point and beach volleyball right in front, great mix of people - very social but not party place. I stayed longer then planned and never had need to go to Puerto Escondido, cos everything I needed was right there."
50,"Little cabins right on the beach in a fun quiet area of Puerto Escondido called La Punta. We loved our cabin (queen-sized bed, small bedside table, fan) with two hammocks and a table right outside it. There are also dorms available.  There is a kitchen that is pretty well stocked with cooking utensils, pots, pans etc. The bathrooms are clean and the showers have good water pressure. You won’t want hot water in this part of Mexico! Lots of drinks and snacks available too, and the staff is very nice and accommodating. You're able to sign up for various tours at the hostel as well.  You can play volleyball with locals in the evenings and there are plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants down the block to eat and drink at. Getting to the main town/beach of Puerto Escondido is about a"
50,"So happy I did my research and stayed at Cabanas Buena Onda. Cabanas Buena Onda is perfectly located on the beach in Punta Zicatela, which is great for surfing. Prices are really fair and the cabanas were great. There is also dorms & camping available for backpackers (I don't think camping gear is provided). Simona was so sweet and helpful with everything we needed. Our cabana was clean, comfortable and spacious. We were also very happy that there was a kitchen for us to use. Bathrooms are shared, but they're always clean and theres always one available.You can also get drinks and water there and the prices are the same as the tienda. Really great place!"
40,"Everyone I had talked to whilst staying at Buene Onda had only planned to stay a few nights, but ended up staying weeks and months because they loved it so much !  It has a great atmosphere, and sense of community. Every night at 6 we would play volleyball with the locals as it is right on the beach  (perfect location) . I loved this hostel , it was defiantly one of my favourites. Stay here if you want a sense of community, are easy going and want to meet great people."
40,"A nice and cheap hostel directly at the beach at the boarder of Puerto Escondido. The staff was very friendly, the hostel clean and it was a perfect place for surfing! I would recommend it to everyone who would like to relax, hang out with other people from the hostel or try surfing!"
10,"We tried to come here off the back of an excellent recommendation from another hostel in San Cristobal. I sent several emails more than a week in advance to reserve as is instructed on their website but received no response.  We arrived on their doorstep with all our stuff, the common area looked dark and grimy and we had to wait around for ten minutes without any indication what to do until we were attended.  The snarky receptionist then told us bluntly and without bothering with p's and q's that there was no room at the inn. I asked why they didn't respond to our booking but didn't receive a reasonable response. We were then left out on the street with all our bags and no advice or assistance from what is allegedly a company who work in hospitality.  All in all they were very"
50,"I came here based on a recommendation and found it impossible to leave. Everything about this hostel is incredible. Pierre and the team have bags of character and charm, the cabanas are clean and situated right on the beach, and it's the most sociable place I found in Mexico. Every day we played volleyball with the locals who are as friendly and engaging as the travellers attracted to this place. It's an impossible spot to beat - a lot of people I had met here had arrived and never left, and were considering themselves residents of Puerto Escondido.  If you want to meet interesting people you have to go. And make sure you introduce yourself to Pierre, he'll have you laughing in seconds."
10,"We had heard only great things about Buena Onda and so booked one private room and one dorm room for the following night. I confirmed this in English and Spanish over the phone.  After a horrific and very hot bus ride, we arrived at Buena Onda only to be told that they didn't have the private room available because the couple staying there the previous night had decided, rather than checking out, to stay on for an extra night.  Rather than apologising for this, the receptionist proudly pronounced that this was the sort of place that Buena Onda was. When I explained to her that we had made a reservation, she responded that this went against their ""concept"" and essentially that those with rooms who decided on a whim to stay would get priority over those who had made a confirmed"
40,"This place was truly amazing! The location was just perfect, the hostel is right on the beach in the sand. It's a very chill place with plenty of great food around. Everybody is so nice and the owners really take their time to talk to you and help you.  The only downside was that it's so hot in the dorms, even with the fans because of the mosquito nets, that I went to sleep in the hammocks every night. So maybe add more fans or something to cool down the rooms. Then it would be perfect!"
50,"Estuvimos hospedado una noche(hubiéramos deseado haber reservado antes ahí) Ya que estábamos hospedados previamente en zicatela (no tan recomendable) Y la última noche decidimos por el hotel mantarrayas y la verdad fue la mejor decisión que pudimos tomar. El hotel es prácticamente nuevo. Amplias habitaciones y limpieza excelente, cuenta con aire acondicionado, televisión por cable una terraza con hamacas para disfrutar del atardecer.  Además está muy muy bien ubicado en una zona tranquila y muy cerca de las mejores playas como: Carrizalillo, puerto angelito, Manzanillo, Coral (aproximadamente a 10 min caminando )  Con una variedad de opciones para comer ,cenar y salir a tomar algo.  Lo único que le hace falta para ser más perfecto es contar con un área de alimentos y bebidas"
50,"It was amazing to get up and be able to walk to beautiful Carrizalillo Beach within 6 minutes!  In less than 3 minutes, I could walk to so many restaurants including Cafecito which opens as early as 6:00 A.M. and walk back to my hotel with takeout coffee or pastries at great prices, or just stay and have an amazing breakfast (or any meal) as of 7:00 A.M.   This hotel is super clean and Mayra, the owner, lives on the property with her husband.  She is very nice and friendly and very attentive to your needs.  The place is secure with locked gates.  It is very clean, quiet,  with good internet and satellite T.V.  I loved it so much that I stayed for 6 weeks !"
50,"Wow wow l’endroit est vraiment incroyable. Secteur très tranquille de Carrizalillo  La propriété est récente de 3 mois, Très propre et sécuritaire avec climatiseur,eau chaude et ventilateur. Juste au bout de la rue les meilleure restos de Puerto-Escondido. Les chambres sont très confortables. La propriétaire Mayra est vraiment aimable. Elle vous aide pour n’importe quelle questions. Belle terrasse sur le toit avec hamac. A 5 minutes à pieds de la plage Carrizalillo. A découvrir."
50,"This place is such a hidden gem!  The owner lives on site and is incredibly helpful but this is her first hotel and she has not marketed it fully online yet.  It is about three months old and I am pretty sure I'm the first person to stay in my room.  The place is totally clean and approximately one block from the main strip in Rinconada.  It is less than a 5 minute walk to the Oasis Surf and Spanish school, where I have been taking classes for a while now.  You can't get any closer and the accommodations provided by Oasis are further away than Casa Mantarrayas.  This makes getting to the 7am class super easy and the only place open early for coffee (Cafecito) is one block away!  I can't say enough good things about this place and hope that the owner learns to market her hidden"
40,We really liked our stay at the experiencia surf Camp. But if you are taking surfing lessons you should ask for “Juan” who is an older surf instructor. He is extremely talented and very patient with you so try to get private lessons with him🏄🏽‍♀️
50,"Experiencia is well-organized and will help plan your stay from beginning to end. The surf school and hotel is secure, clean, comfortable, and located near one of the greatest surf spots in Puerto Escondido. Our teacher Paola was fantastic, and kept us entertained with her enthusiasm and stories each day in class. The Spanish school ensures each student is properly placed in the course; students have the ability to learn at their own pace; all instructors are extremely knowledgeable, available, and willing to go the extra mile for their students. The surf school is excellent for all levels of surfing; instructors ensure student’s safety in the water, most important, they keep everyone stoked on surfing. Alex does amazing surf photography; is very helpful in email correspondence,"
10,"I had a brilliant six weeks in Puerto Escondido, unfortunately nothing of that can be accredited to staying with Experiencia - the only language they speak is money.  Spanish School: The teachers were very nice, but as soon as you reach a certain level of Spanish you'll notice that none of them actually have a qualification to teach. That not only limits your progress, but might as well cause confusion about things you already know; as you do not get necessary and correct explanations every time. Then again, as a beginner or to just practice your speaking this is absolutely sufficient and you will have lots of fun! On first sight the open air classrooms seem cool, but at some point the heat paired with the chatter and music/videos from a couple of other classes nearby start to"
50,"I stayed at the surf camp for two weeks in december.  It was two amazing weeks. I had spanish lessons in the morning and then surf lessons in the afternoon.  The surf instructors drove us to school everyday and picked us up when the school was done. I never had any spanish before, but i learned enough to travel around central America afterwards.  It was also my first time trying to surf. I really liked it, and the intructors were really good and professional. I had the same instructor the most days, and it was really good and cozy.  The school also arranged a lot of social events which was really cool!  I would definitely recommend the place!   "
50,"I stayed at Experiencias surf-camp and combined spanish clases and surf clases for two amazing weeks. The accomondation at the surfcamp was great, big clean rooms and nice common areas with room for relaxsation but definitely also lots of fun! I never had any spanish before my stay at Experiencia, but during those two weeks I really felt that I improoved my spanishskills. Surfing really surprised me - I didnt think that I would enjoy it as much as I did. Even though it was very difficult the instructors were so patient and did an amazing job teaching! Another great thing about the surfing was that we had our own instructor and also the same person every time - so I felt very comfortable because I got to know the instructore during the two weeks. I would definitely recomend"
50,"The perfect school for learning a new language, surf and relaxing in the sun. The staff are amazing and really made me feel home and relaxed from the moment I came in the doors. They include everyone and make you feel noticed in the Spanish classes by having groups with 5 students at the time, and every week you change teacher with different ways of teaching. The surf instructors make you feel comfortable and safe in the water, and show you and explain everything step by step in advance. When I was there all the students did a lot of activities together in the evening. I'v got friends that still are in my life today and will be for the rest of my life. If you're not sure to travel alone or not, let me help you be sure of traveling alone. Make friends for life and learn a new"
50,"Well, first of all, this is way above the average service level that you expect from south of Mexico. I've attended some other language and surf schools before (Europe, Bali, Vietnam), and this was one of the best services I've received so far! Apart from that, the school has the new surfcamp building (couldn't find it's profile here on tripadvisor), with nice new rooms and awesome vibes.  Every morning Miguel (the surf coordinator and driver) gave us a ride to the classes, and then from school to surf. The teachers are pro's but not as boring as they were in Spain (at least profesores Silvia and Alberto) - the lessons were really fun!  I took the Standard 25 course, was a bit tiring sometimes but at least in 4 weeks I learned enough to get around Mexico with no problem for the"
30,This hostel has been converted to a language schools. They offer room if they have availability but it is not a hostel anymore.  The place looks very similar to before. It has a kitchen and they also offer short spanish courses. 
50,"This hotel just off the main drag in Puerto Escondido. Lots of lovely touches like hammocks, nice bathrooms, well kept courtyard. Great value for money. Staff are extremely helpful going out of their way to answer queries. There is a disco nearby but that is hard to avoid in any central part of P.E."
50,"Do not look any further you found the hotel that you will never want to leave. A delightful patio, nice rooms with azulejos, hamaca to have a beer tranquilo at the end of the day and on top of this, a host that will help you feel at home!  Next to all the beaches, you can do everything walking! Muy buena onda !"
20,"On my 2nd morning there, when I heard the cleaning ladies moving in the rooms next door and slowly approaching, I placed myself right behind the door of my room and waited with crossed arms for 20 seconds... The ladies came in!!! One was old and proud, the other one who the previous day had said that I hadn't heard her knocking was very apologetic and repeated ""We thought you weren't in, we thought, we thought..."". As I was still planning on staying another week, I said  to them that they shouldn't ""think"", they should knock!! Then I said they could now come in anyhow... But now Mrs. Pride refused to come in as she said she was Very offended...and I was trying to assure her it was ok to come in (I was upset, but I never used any bad language!!)... I went down to seriously ask if"
50,"Just returned from a week with Edith and Valentina with 14 other lady friends from Toronto.  It was amazing.  I worked with Edith prior to our stay to make special arrangements for meals and activities.  They provided breakfast daily and also snacks during the day. We had three very special dinners at the Casa and the food was some of the best ever. We are booking again for next year.  I have been in the hospitality business for over 30 years and can truly say...you will never be disappointed here with the service, venue or the amazing love from Edith and the family."
40,"Air conditioning,  pool, even a community kitchen for $50 pesos. The room was clean  and we even had a patio. It overlooked the beach, so walking distance to lots of places.  The staff was friendly and helpful."
50,"If you are surching for a romantic, nice, familiar nest - you just got it! In the last years this hotel is our harbourage, haven to forget our working days and problems. I love those small details what Alicia & Pepe built in this HOME. You just feel their soul in every small part in the hotel: the paintings in the wall, the flowers in the garden (even the flower-pot), the ceramics in the bathroom. I just love Puerta del Sol - makes me relaxed, makes me feel home and be a member of this mexican town. "
30,"We showed up during low season without a reservation, and asked for a quiet room.  The owner said we would be happiest in the room at the end of the gallery, no one would walk past it.  Unfortunately, she failed to mention the hotel Rockaway next door has parties with blaring music late at night.  But Puerto Escondido is a party town and we have not yet found our quiet place where we would love to return every winter. Our room was very clean but basic, no frills:  large comfortable bed and pillows, fridge, no amenities to speak of. There is a common kitchen (50$MEX) and you can rent beach towels (50$MEX).  The pool is clean and nice. The wifi connection was a problem except very early in the mornings.  There is a nice café a few doors away (Cafecito) with a very good connection"
30,"The location of the bungalows is fantastic, right in the middle of the Zicatela esplanade but that's about the only positive.  The staff are inattentive and rude, we had to ask them multiple times to plug the modem back into the power as they had unplugged it to charge their own things.   We were asked twice to pay for our stay, even though we paid in full at arrival. The room we stayed in was number 10, don't stay in this room. It's a hot box and noisy.   The website makes this place look like paradise, it's not. It's really basic, which is fine if that's what you're after. The beds and pillows are rubbish and the bathrooms very basic.  The pool is a nice addition and the lady with the tiny cafe in the front is lovely. I'm sure you'd find something nicer for a little more money"
50,"This place is simply lovely. Spotlessly clean and fresh, air conditioning in all rooms, lovely garden courtyard. The people at the front desk have been so friendly - don't know what the other negative reviewer was talking about. They've gone out of their way to be friendly and helpful, and seem like super nice people. The pool is small but clean and pretty, there's lots of sun as well as shade, the rooms are large, porches pretty - can't say enough about this place. It's simple, but fantastic. Price was lower here than at several other places that were no where near as nice. We left our first hotel that had actually scored higher on trip advisor, but it was moldy and dirty and more expensive. We fled, and were so glad to find this spot. "
50,"We live permanently in Oaxaca de Juarez and get to the coast 2 or 3 times a year and always stay at the same hotel. Very boring but quick and easy. This time we stepped out a little and looked at a few more hotels and decided on the Bungalows at Puerta del Sol. It was a fantastic choice.  It has a small swimming pool, parking, large clean rooms with crisp linen, hot water and air conditioning with a better rate (800 pesos) than we normally get. The staff were friendly and helpful, The owner sat with us in the outdoor, common kitchen one afternoon for a chat while we drank some wine and smoked cigars. A very nice lady. The next night when returning from supper where we picked up a bottle of mezcal we again entered into a conversation about our day. She then had her husband bring"
30,"This place is on the beach and has a laundry service, rooms are clean and massive most have balconies. Not much English spoken but we didn't have a problem. Lots of great restaurants and bar within a few hundred metres. Nice clean pool when the surf is too big to play in. Seems to be family owned and they live here nothing flash but we were very happy to stay here."
30,"Owners are very mean the female front desk lady yelled at us for running the a.c. That we paid a lot of extra for.  And then every time we left our hotel room we would have to see her again soaking up all the wifi before it could get to any customers.  Wifi was terrible don't expect much there. I am really torn on this place because the husband is a really nice guy very positive and what you would think a hotel owner would be like.  The wife just made our visit miserable every time we left or came back to our room. The place is great clean rooms trust worthy cleaning staff, just a mean as hell front desk lady. "
30,"This is a nice guesthouse type accommodation with traditional white washed rooms, wooden furniture & hot showers. It's an open plan court yard surrounded by rooms & balconies with a lovely refreshing pool area which is well kept. Nice sea view rooms & apartments.  Overseen by an older local couple who are both helpful & informal which kind of makes you feel at home. The security is good here, they lock a front gate at night which you have key access to. There is a small juice bar area at the front / joined to the guesthouse independently run by a lovely man that makes amazing fruit juices, fruit breakfasts, homemade bread, sandwiches & good Organic coffee. There were a fair amount  of older active travellers here staying for a while who looked very happy hear. For us it was very"
50,"Thank you,  thank you Edith and Victoria! This was our second trip to Casa Junto al Mar. I'm thrilled to say that the only thing that changed was the marvelous improvements to the property.  Beautiful house, beautiful staff and hospitality that is unparalleled.  I had an unfortunate illness and I was offered to stay as long as I needed (hours past checkout) to recover as luckily new guests weren't arriving until the next day.  They even stopped loud repairs theft they were going to do that day so I could rest.  Above and beyond is what you will get if you stay here.  I love the place so much that I selfishly don't want too many people to know😏 There were 12 of us and ALL of our expectations. We will be baaaccckkkk!!"
50,"So we have stayed in many lovely placed in Mexico but this place has to be the very best yet. Not sure what I like the best, the pool or the fact that someone makes the bed every day. The housekeeper Victoria has been awesome, always available to help us, while using her phone app to translate what we need so she can accommodate  all our wims and needs.  The manager Edith has been a great help as well. Giving wonderful suggestions on where to eat out,  where to buy the freshest produce available and helping with an un planned medical problem. The house is spectular  with the infinity pool that overlooks the ocean,  the patio table that is just begging to be used for either a meal or an evening drink to watch the sunset; show us that tomorrow will yet be another amazing day here"
50,"We spent two weeks in Casa Junto Al Mar and enjoyed every minute of it. The casa is perched on a rock overlooking the Pacific Ocean and has a beautiful infinity pool that was so enjoyable to use. We looked forward to coming home from the beach or other activities and relaxing and swimming in the pool. The main house has 2 bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, each one overlooking the pool and the ocean. Vicky, the housekeeper kept the house and grounds very neat and helped us with whatever we needed. Tim and Edith, the proprietors, were wonderful. They responded immediately to any little problems we had and also offered us advice on what to visit in the surrounding area. We will definitely be back next year. EA"
50,"All I can say is that we have travelled the world but I have never had a more relaxing holiday. The setting is gorgeous, location wonderful close to many restaurants and beaches and our housekeeper Vicki could not have been sweeter. Also our ""landlords"" Tim and Edith went way beyond the call of duty in being welcoming and helpful. We plan to return next winter!!!  Lee (Inuit). "
50,"We stayed here almost a week, the house has all the convenient you can dresm of, it is absolutely beautiful with an infinity pool just sbove the cliff,  where sea birds snd eagles seems like in touching distance. Edith who runs the place was really nice and helpful."
40,"The place is beautiful, it is equipped with everything you need to have a pleasant stay, besides that the breakfast really makes you feel at home. They gave us recommendations on where to go and what to do, the beach where the turtles are released. It is great choice value for money, definitely a place to go back."
50,"12 of us rented Junto Al Mar for a week over Christmas.  The house was great, especially the infinity pool.  What made the holiday, though, was our host Edith.  She arranged a chef for our 50th Anniversary dinner, she gave us a tour of the market, and hooked us up with all sorts of great food (tamales, chiles rellenos and our christmas meal).  By the end of the week she was part if the family.  We would highly recommend Junto Al Mar, and most especially Edith.  Cheers - Lorne"
50,"I like to travel  around the world and I found this beutiful house in Puerto Escondido. Just what I was looking for, relaxation, peaceful and good attention from the manager Edith. Wonderful lady, she is from town and speaks english. She made my stay wonderful. Good restaurant on the Rinconada and Adoquin."
50,"My husband and I stayed a few days at casa junto al mar in Puerto Escondido and we must say it was the highlight of our stay in Mexico. We stayed in the room they let in the main house which provides a patio and views over a wonderful pool, the sea and the sunset. We were able to choose our own breakfasts every morning and eat at a time of our choosing, the landlady Edith is an excellent cook. The room was clean with a great bed and all the facilities where to a very high standard. They made us feel thoroughly at home and we did some wonderful things with the family. We would stay there again tomorrow and can recommend it to all comers !"
50,"La Escondida is a new hostel in the town of Puerto Escondido. It has nice and clean facilities, great breakfast, rooms with air condition and the most important, wonderful people who work there and help you with all your needs. It’s a social hostel were people meet and hang around the town and beaches and everybody has a great time.  Puerto Escondido is a surfer town and for me as a non-surfer there is plenty to do and to explore.  The hostel offers tours to the bioluminescent Lagoon at night, sunset beaches and many more.  Through the hostel I rented a scooter with some friends to be mobile throughout the town and the neighboring places.  On our first day we explored the town, the beaches and places to eat.  On our second day we took our scooters and some surfboards(for those"
10,"The place itself seemed pretty cool, but at night it was very noisy (between the party at Puerto Dreams and the type of guest the two places attract). The dorms are ridiculously hot: the fans do nothing to cool the space and you’ll roast if you use the privacy curtain on your bed. AC is used only during the night (per hostel policy). It was turned on at 10 PM and the room didn’t start to feel cool until 1. All of the guests in my room were complaining about the heat—it was hotter in the rooms than it was outside—and a hostel employee tried to act like this was standard. (I’ve stayed in several different places along the coast of Oaxaca and none were this hot.) The employee actually told the guests to “take a cold shower,” and one even wet his sheets with cold water in an effort"
50,"I went for a week and I ended up living there. The cleanliness, atmosphere, and staff are priceless. I met my best friend and my girlfriend here. I can’t say more!  Yes, i can say more. The place is located in the heart of Puerto, and the best bar in Puerto is just next door!"
50,"A short stay turned into a few weeks, excellent staff who really know how to party and take care of all the broken travellers. Relaxing, infomative and comfortable with regular activities such as lunch outings (sushimi - yum!), volleyball and salsa night. Great central location and very affordable prices. A super review for a super hostel, highly recommend"
50,"I spent one week here and it was amazing. Super nice staff, they help you with everything, super events. A great atmosphere and lots of kind people around. Loved the place and I'm already thinking about going back to that place. Highly recommended!"
50,"Super cool hostel! Planned to only stay a few days and couldn’t leave. Ideal place to chil for a little while. Awesome place to be alone as a super social vibe and linked to Puerto dreams so best of both worlds for either partying at the bar upstairs or hanging in the Netflix area downstairs. Staff are super friendly and make you feel very welcome and there is lots of places to eat near by, a super market etc and several nice beaches in walkable distance or on free bikes! Free breakfast is good, dorms are very clean and cool enough of a night time. Also recommend the activities they do the Temezcal was an amazing experience and the beach volleyball and salsa night! Would happily stay again and recommend to any one going to Puerto.. Iv already booked to come back! Feels like home."
50,"I love this hostel! The staff are beyond amazing, and go out of their way to help you and make you feel as comfortable as possible. Share facilities with puerto dreams which is right next door, connected by step. The place is perfect if you are a solo traveller. The breakfast is great, and vegetarian! And it’s always different, so you don’t get bored of it! I originally was just staying two night, but ended up stayed for two weeks! If I didn’t have a flight to catch I would have stayed a lot longer. I can not wait to come back!"
40,This lovely small hotel has a wonderful landlady that is very helpful and interesting. We found this little gem after much searching as Escondido had high priced and low priced for the surfers but not much in between. This was perfect for the price. Third floor is best for the view and the breeze if you don't mind the stairs. Reservations are accepted and the pool is well kept. I did not really enjoy sharing the fridge and the communal kitchen as everyone wanted to eat at the same time but when it is not busy or people that are staying eat out it was perfect. If you are very social you may like the interesting variety of people that stay there or if with a group you could take up all the rooms.
50,"Llegamos a Casa Olga después de recorrer varios lugares de Puerto Escondido, zicatella. Lo que nos hizo decidirnos por el lugar fue que tenía una hermosa cocina al aire libre, y nosotros éramos un grupo de viajeros que nos gusta COCINAR; y el precio fue barato: 700 la noche para 6 personas.  En nuestra estadía puedo decir que Limpieza era siempre excelente. Te dan toallas, jabón, y limpian todos los días la pieza. Olga es excelente con la limpieza, y su alberca está siempre impecable, transparente. Buenos colchones también, y baños de verdad!! El atardecer es perfecto, y se ve la playa. Lo que puedo decir es que no nos podíamos ir, Hugo y Olga son muy buena gente, y el lugar es seguro."
20,"We arrived to Casa Olga and were pleased by the price and a very nice view from the top floor room. We enjoyed our stay, but were very stirred with the fact Olga would not let us take shower nor go to the bathroom after we checked out and went to the beach, she stated she had all her rooms full even though se offered to pay for the shower and bathroom! When we asked if we can stay one more night she suddenly had a room available. In the end she let us use the garden shower, but still this is no way to treat your guests."
20,"l'hotel si trova a pochi passi dal mare, nonostante la signora olga vanti di avere l'hotel più pulito di Puerto Escondido, nella camera erano presenti formiche e una sera ho ammazzato uno scarafaggio di modeste dimensioni. la ventola risultava piena di polvere quindi abbiamo evitato di accenderla. camera moto grande ove erano presenti altri due letti matrimoniali. in uno di questi erano poggiati gli zaini e puntualmente la mattina dopo le pulizie li ritrovavamo a terra. Al ritorno del mare i proprietari ripetevano più volte che era meglio non andare in camera con la sabbia del mare nelle ciabatte quindi invitava a lavarsi all'esterno vicino alla piscina!!!"
50,"We have been coming here for years and really wouldn't try to stay any where else! Our home away from home in puerto Escondido. Beautiful rooms, an outdoor kitchen, super clean rooms and the most hospitable hosts. "
10,"when we first got to Puerto Escondido we stayed the first nights in Casa olga,she took 400 Peso per night,  it was the worst night of my life!! the rooms dont have AC, and it was soooo hot!, we couldn't open the doors becous there were  Iguana that we see outside and we didnt want thay will get in the room. but the worst thing!!!!  when we checked in the room, i turn the Ceiling Fan On, and left the Curtains open, and went to the beach, when we came back the fen was Off, and the curtains close, I asked her if someone got in the room, she said no, whan i told her I know somone there , Olga started sayind she turn the fan Of, I got mad and said she cant go in the room when all of our thing there!! we left the next day, went to HOTEL INES, paid 560 Peso and got a room with aTV and"
50,"Right in front of Playa Zicatela, Casa Olga is a great little place to stay. It is a three story building that has a shallow outdoor pool and shower as well as an outside kitchen for everyone to use. The rooms themselves are spotless and each have an outside terrace with 2 hammocks which overlooks the ocean. There are only 5 rooms so the place is very quiet and I had the best sleeps there of my entire vacation. The couple who runs the place are very nice and are happy to give you information about certain places in Puerto, If you don't like dogs, I wouldn't recommend about  staying here as the owner has two but they seem to be everywhere in Puerto Escondido. There is also a friendly iguana that hangs out in different places on the property. It was little more than I had wanted"
10,"I'd never stay here again.  I stayed here three times and each time the air con was louder than the previous time.  There's no need for it in this day and age.  When will they stop building new bits of the hotel and spend a bit of money on making the existing bits bearable?  It's a pity because it's in a nice location and the first time I went there - way back in the late 1980s or early 90s - it was a really nice, fairly small hotel."
50,"For many years we had stayed at the the Santa Fe for our annual Mexico vacation in January, but it had been four years since we visited Puerto Escondido, so we were not sure what to expect. My son, daughter-in-law, two grandsons and I spent ten days there in March 2012 and we were totally pleased with all the amenities of our favorite hotel -- it just gets better. It is simply the best place to stay in P.E. Gorgeous surroundings, wonderful pools, excellent service with very pleasant personnel, spacious comfortable and clean rooms, delicious, authentic, and always fresh food (don't let the vegetarian menu scare you--I'm not vegetarian, but the shrimp, fish, and cheese-based dishes and soups more than make up for lack of meat dishes, and except for pork, meat in Mexico usually"
40,"We had reservations for two nights at this hotel but fell in love with all the facilities including the wonderful restaurant overlooking the beach, nice pools and just the overall feel. Our three bed room was nice. Nothing super but cozy. I loved the staff, this being our first time in Puerto Escondido they were very accomodating in making sure our needs were met. I speak a little Spanish so I had a super time but you can enjoy all the hotel has to offer without it. So In all we stayed a week there enjoying it's charm and location. We are going back and will stay another week or more next year."
50,"Hotel Santa Fe is a world unto itself....peaceful, elegant, and gracious.  The public spaces and gardens are comfortable, cool and inviting, the pools are spotless, the rooms have high ceilings, lovely linens and air conditioning, and the beds are comfortable.   The restaurant is one of the finest in town, and the prices have not changed in years.  The view of the beach and the water from the spacious dining room is hypnotic and memorable, and the food is fresh, original and delicious.  The staff is very helpful and friendly. If a relaxing vacation is what you need, you never have to leave the lovely compound.  It's a wonderful place!"
50,"we stayed at the Hotel Santa Fe for the first leg of a 3-week honemoon and it was great. Had i not been honeymooning I may have chosen a lower budget hotel but in Santa Fe we really were in our little bubble. The Junior Suit room was cool and spacious, with a little balcony overlooking one of 2 pools where we often sat at night listenign to the local band playing across the road.   The pools were clean and as the hotel was not very busy we felt we had privacy and didn't feel observed at all. The location is great, just across from the beginning of Playa Zicatela and perfect to walk to many restaurants and bars at night. Service was polite but not intrusive and the food was lovely, although we hardly ate there - lost to see and savour in Puerto Escondido. Also... they have a"
40,"I had no problem with the fact that the hotel overlooks the beach but has a road I between, it was a pity however that our room really had no view at all.  The hotel is quaint, well laid out with a lovely homely feel.  The swimming pools are very clean and refreshing but not too cold, sun bathing area on the terrace overlooking the beach is pure relaxation.  We had dinners a la carte breakfast and breakfast buffet during our stay.  Alll meals were tasty, fairly priced and the service excellent.  We had one full day on the beach, had breakfast in a beachfront cafe and as a result had free sun beds and umbrellas all day, a nice touch.  Beware, the current in the sea is very, very strong and we witnessed one rescue by beach patrol that day.  On the downside, our room, whilst clean"
40,"love this little hotel, however, most rooms do not have a beach view. also, the hotel is located by the beach but not at the beach, there is a road between the hotel and the beach. Also, most rooms do not have a beach views. the best part of this hotel is the restaurant. I travel often to the beaches in mexico and this restaurant is the best ever!   Be very carefull in puerto escondido, the poace in wornderful, but the economy of the state is the worst in the country. I was mugged and asulted at night and do not use the ATM at the beach. They cloned a lot of cards in that machine."
50,"Hotel Santa Fe is the perfect place for a hang-out Real Vacation! The hotel is beautiful and well maintained with two swimming pools and stunning ocean views from the lounging deck and from the restaurant. The food is of the highest quality, especially the fish and the veggies. The menu is imaginative and the drinks good. There is a 2+ mile sandy beach a few steps from the hotel door with a very good reputation for surfing. The Santa Fe is reasonably priced for what you get -- which is a lot!"
50,"I just returned from my favorite spot on the planet other than my home which is Puerto Escondido in the state of Oaxaca. I've travelled all over the world on business and I have not found a more magical place to be than Puerto Escondido. Now, if you want the best experience in Puerto Escondido then stay at the Santa Fe Hotel and Bungalows. Across the street and to your right is the safest swimming beach in the area and to your left is one of the world's top ten surfing beach, so you can say the Hotel Santa Fe is in the most ideal location. the architecture and landscaping is all in the old Spanish Colonial style and just gets better as it  ages. The restaurant is open air facing the beach and ocean and the food is just great. Given all the physical beauty,still the best"
40,"Spent some days at Santa Fe a few days ago and it was a treat to experience the old Mexico charm to be found at this hotel.  We stayed there for a week last year and we were happy to return. The pools are refreshing in Puerto's relentless heat and the accomodations are truly relaxed and gracious.  We stayed in a bungalow with seperate bedroom (2 queen bed), sitting area /kitchen /sofas for extra bedding , Air conditioned too... and a patio out the front door with seating and a hammock. .  Price 1500 pesos per night...regular rooms were 1200 peso per night.  The bungalows are close to the road so you can hear some cars but a privacy wall keeps things private...and the bungalows share a pool which was really convienient.  There are two other pools on the property.   Also the"
50,Had an awesome first ever surf lesson with Angelo and Fabian. As we were completely new to surfing they were extremely patient and knowledgeable teachers - and also so fun to hang out with. At the beginning of the lesson there was a big emphasis on safety in the water and teaching you the correct technique which made you feel that you were in great hands. We all had the best morning thanks guys!
50,"I booked for five days, but I could've stayed for two weeks. I had a great, great time. The rooms get cleaned daily, and the rest of the property feels like an enormous living room. The management is great — they operate like a family and it rubs off on the guests. If you're a solo traveler, it's like instant companionship. The food is also great. You get your money's worth many times over."
50,"we had a great time here. the rooms & area is really clean for a beach hostel & there is AC in the rooms, which is luxury! The people are all very welcoming & friendly. You don't get towels but every bed has its seperate charger. The hostel is located a 5 minutes walk to the city center which is perfect! "
50,"Was amazed how this hostel was run but it worked out. Great price for a week of stay very close to the beach. Angelo and Simba were welcoming and the parties and stay were a great pleasure.  If you go there ask for the ""car wash"" experience, it is Ceviche (raw fish) and beer served in a car wash - truly local and best price for highest quality.  If you are open minded and look for nice company or la vida loca, they can provide you that!"
50,"My time at Mexpipe House was beyond incredible. The people, the energy, the location, the surf, the beaches, and the local food were all amazing. Way more than I could have ever imagined. The staff were all super kind and the hostel seems to have a way of attracting great people. It's location is perfect An absolute must-go when staying in Puerto Escondido."
50,"Super chill hostel next to the beach, great vibes, good accommodation and super friendly and helpful staff. Just feels like home. Would have stayed longer, and would come back for sure ! Don't hesitate one second "
50,"Super nice house 2 min from playa Zicatela, with an outdoor lounge, kitchen and swimming pool. Angelo the host manager is great and really accommodating. It's a great spot in the center of things in Puerto. Would def stay again!"
20,"The rooms are nice for the money u are paying however, the one night we spent was awful. We couldnt sleep because their were bed bugs and  two roaches in our room. The owner is super grumpy and we had a few problems with him... also, if you want to use the terrace u cant although the ad says u can, as the owner impolitely told us that it is exclusive for them. We didnt know how Puerto Escondido is settup but now I can tell u THERE ARE BETTER PLACES OUT THERE! ...Also, they are located in the sketchy part of P.E."
20,"This place has potential but misses the mark in a number of areas. The setting is attractive - the buildings are nice and there are beautiful plants and murals everywhere. On the other hand the shared area is a constant chaotic dirty mess. Forget about using the shared kitchen for this same reason. Many of the guests treat this (and the shared bathrooms) like their flophouse, leaving their junk and paraphernalia scattered all over the place. The owner Maria is a sweet lady, but almost too sweet... she can't seem to set boundaries, for example with her guests or her own dogs. The latter were the biggest issue: on several occasions we saw her dogs aggressively lunge, corner and almost bite other guests, creating some tense scenes. Happened to us as well. You should not have to"
50,"We stayed with Maria Elena for about one month. There was a great vibe and the place soon felt like home to a big, happy family. It's gorgeous and relaxed, perfect place to hang out and enjoy life. And Maria Elena is an amazing person and a great cook!"
50,"This is my 4th time I've stayed at Estacion B when in PE.  Close to the beach, new and clean Cabanas (each hand-decorated differently by Marie). Food is to die for! Marie gave us also so many good recommendations what to see and visit while in Oaxaca.  We've stayed for over a week and looking forward to come back soon. Highly recommend for family feel, relaxed/easygoing atmosphere of the place."
40,"Lovely place. Marie is a wonderful friendly person. Great food very chilled and a short walk to La Punta bars, cafes, and beach. Good layout and different types of accommodation from a hammock or tent to a self contained cabaña. "
50,"After over two years of traveling, this might very well be my favorite hostel. Just blocks from La Punta (surf beach), this hostel has tons of beautifully labdscaped open air spaces to hang out (with others or alone), kitchen, hammocks, well stocked fridges with drinks, WiFi and friendly staff. Best of all, Marie cooked me the most delicious Mexican food I've ever eaten. The atmosphere is more like family than hostel. Really special place, no other Puerto Escondido hostel even came close. Marie even personally took me to catch my bus to make sure I wouldn't miss it. Perfect."
50,"I'm so happy I found Estacion B! Very nice and clean cabañas, central hangout place with hammocks, close to the beach and La Punta bars/restaurants. But the main reason is the host Marilena! She cooks wonderful dinners, creates a welcome and relax atmosphere to have beers in the evening and organizes great excursions to nearby (less touristic) places. No wonder that most other guests I met were 'regulars', coming back to estacion B for several years! :-) "
50,"We booked estacion b at the last minute, as it was the last place we could find with availability in the La Punta area. Talk about striking it lucky! We booked in for four days and ended up staying three weeks (and would have stayed longer if we could). After being on the road for nine months, we found our home away from home at estacion b in Puerto.   The place is gorgeous, a little Mexcian hacienda. The facilities are fantastic, the cabanas are clean and contemporary with fresh sheets and towels provided. There was always hot water, and plenty of places to hang out, under the big palapa or around the gardens in hammocks. There is a fridge stocked with cold beers and a big communal to sit around and talk surfing or about anything you like with your fellow guests. We ended up"
50,"Perfectly located within 2 min walk from La Punta surf spot & from it's various restaurants and shops. There are several cabanas, all clean and nicely decorated, each with it's own spirit. If you are a couple, try the ""love cabana"". Separate kitchen and bbq spot to be used by guests. Fridge with cold drinks & beers. Do not miss to try awesome Marielena's home cooking for breakfasts and dinners (last year we did both - Christmas and New Year dinner and it was just great). You can always make new friends in common area with the long table and the hammacks. The atmosphere is so nice and friendly that It feels like your second home that you never wanna leave."
50,"i have been travelling to puerto escondido since the end of the nineties, staying in different places. since 1998 i stayed at this cabanas, in those days near the central andador, nowadays a rather messy walking stripe by the playa marinero. the owner has relocated in the more quiet southern end of playa zicatela, renowned as la punta de zicatela, and her choice has been a wise move, since the surrounding have the better and more relaxed part of the famous surf beach. add to this her grear home cooking, from breakfast to sandwiches to mega dinner, where she offers an unconventional mexican cuisine, mixing traditional dishes to innovative flavors, a top cook who has a great taste. rooms have a nice decoration, with precious azulejos and shells been used in every detail, mosquito"
50,"I wanted to thank Luis and the staff for a wonderful stay! This place is paradise! Location couldn’t be better. Everything is beautifully decorated and the staff is super friendly and always ready to make sure we have everything we need. Food, drinks… anything I can think of, you make it happen. Service is just exceptional.   I couldn’t imagine a better place to enjoy some downtime. The peaceful atmosphere made me relax as soon as I set foot here. My only complaint: this is too pretty! How do I go back to normal life now?   Best regards, Demian Reidel  PS: I’m absolutely coming back."
50,"From the minute we arrived this gem never disappointed.  We had done all the booking ourselves and on arrival there appeared to be a problem. Luis dealt with the situation with charm and calm efficiency and when Sammy arrived we were treated like royalty and apologies . Never have we stayed anywhere like it. It is like being in your own fully staffed private villa. The staff are well trained and always sweeping sand off beds and terracing, meals can be taken at any time anywhere ..... totally up to each guest. The garden is candle lit each evening and nowhere is more stunning from which to watch the most spectacular of sunsets. Sammmy. is the most perfect host and leads by example .  Nothing is too much trouble for him or any of his staff The attention to detail is unparalleled"
50,"This is, undeniably, a wonderful and highly esthetic place. We would say, it is even better than it looks in the pictures. Whoever created and manages this resort, must, obviously, be very talented. Neither do we consider ourselves to be hotel testers nor do we, in a frenzy of emotions, consider every other hotel we visit to be the best we have ever stayed at. We travel a lot for pleasure, have traveled to 150 countries. In the midst of the Covid lockdowns alone, we traveled to Maui, California, Bora Bora, the Maldives, Rome, Florence, the Swiss Alps, and many other European destinations. One of the last hotels we stayed at before we came here was the Ritz Paris. What we want to say is that we are not easily impressed. But the esthetics of this place, how every detail was well"
50,"We just came back from this wonderful resort and we cannot state how grateful we are to have stayed at this incredible place in Puerto Escondido.   We were traveling with a senior person and a 1 year old baby and the hotel staff (shout out to Mary, Poncho and Lety) went above and beyond to assure we were all confortable and happy.   This hotel makes you feel right at home, their open concept kitchen and huge dining table allow you to interact with other guests and create a warm environment.   The food is exquisite and every meal is personalized and planned to your preferences, Poncho makes sure he has the freshest seafood and the taste is incredible.   Sammy the owner is the best host. He saw we were traveling with a baby and made sure the kitchen was stocked up with vegetables"
50,"We enjoyed 2 nights at Amalys Luxury Resort. From the moment we arrived, we experienced the most gracious, kindest hospitality ever. The owner Sammy welcomed us to feel at home... And we did! Sammy has a wonderful team of employees who put their heart into their work. And it shows! Thank you Pancho (chef) Leti and Marie and everyone else for your gracious hospitality.   This resort is truly breathtaking. From the grounds, to our private villa, to the furnishings. Every area demonstrates care, attention and dedication to an outstanding guest experience.  The 40 meter long pool is one of a kind. The meals are simply delicious. And evenings on the rooftop patio enjoying the stars were some of our favourite memories.   The resort is about 30 minutes from the Puerto Escondido airport"
50,"Loved every moment here and will be back!!! The owners treated me like a princess!!!! The rooms were so clean, luxurious, and very comfortable. The food and meals were amazingly delicious, so beautiful and fresh! The pool has a stunning view of the south Pacific Ocean. I could also see both the sunrise and sunset everyday on the beach; just steps from my room. There is something so rewarding about traveling a long distance and then arriving in a gorgeous spot, and leaving with a calmer mind."
50,"We arrived last week in this real palace on a secluded beach in front of the Pacific Ocean, just 10 min south of Puerto Escondido after a trip from Mexico Df, Oaxaca and Huatulco. The owners are just great people, coming from the Kingdom of Belgium and they build a superb resort, really exclusive. Everything is great, the suites, the atmosphere, the mediterranean mexican fusion food, the drinks, the salty with no chlorine pool arriving in the main palapa, the ecological way of living. A romantic place !!"
40,"I went to casa de las iguanas to play billar and drink some beers, the service is great! And the place is beautiful I will be coming back a lot the music is so cool my stay here is amazing he rooms are beautiful and they pool like a lake in the middle of a jungle ! "
40,"3 friends and I stayed at this beautiful hotel in Puerto Escondido at the start of December 2013. It is located in a hilly street just off the main street. When we were there, the reception staff were extremely helpful, as we had to make numerous phone calls to the local airport and they did so in Spanish without hesitation. We had 2 rooms next to each other, with a bed and comfortable sized bathroom. Each had a patio where you could sit on the couch overlooking the beautiful pool. Unfortunately the bar/entertaining area was being renovated, but on our next visit, I'm sure it will look fantastic. Never at all did we feel unsafe. A restaurant up the road served delicious fish tacos, too!"
40,"Great location at zicatela beach. Very clean with very friendly and helpful staff. Great prices. Nice pool, super cool bar themed with devils and skeletons, GORGEOUS view. Had a safe which was good especially spending most of our time at the beach. Only downside was that they didn't have a fridge. Overall,  great place!!"
50,"Only 7 or 8 rooms in this hotel, which makes for a cosy atmosphere. Also the pool (incl. whirlpool) was nice. The hotel is on a side street of the main street, so it's both near everything and and quiet. Only downside is that the hotel bar was closed. But you can still get beers/soft drinks for the pool. Make sure you check out the restaurant down the street (apparently from the same owners), the food was the best I had in puerto Escondido. And also the pizzas across the street;)"
50,"great vibe, fantastic owners (thanks for all!) and the best location in La Punta! I loved the breakfast, the common space with shade, breeze and hammocks, and the atmosphere, perfect to chill out after surfing or partying."
50,"Akadia is the best hostel experience in Mexico.  You'll love the owners that make this location like home. I stayed a month because of the atmosphere I found there.  It's a wonderful house directly on the beach with few dorms and private rooms, perfect size for meeting people and having an amazing time in Mexico.  Because it's new, few things are still fixing but you don't care because it's the same at home ;-) Definitely to recommand !"
20,"Akadia offers a great view, but the accommodations were pretty terrible.  The toilets didn't work for almost our entire time, we didn't have running water for a while, and the owner did not offer much help.  If you're just looking for a beach, this is good, but you can find better places for the same price."
50,"We had a wonderful time at Akadia! Actually we only wanted to spend there 2 nights but in the end we stayed there more than a week and it was still hard to leave this place. It's one of the few places where you simply feel home as soon as you arrive. We camped in the beautiful garden, when it began to rain we could easily switch to a dorm. The shady garden invites you just relax in one of the hammocks, or if you want to be more active go on the slackline or try some hula hoop! :) The kitchen is really clean and well equipped. in addition, drinking water is included! Beds are comfortable, the location is perfect and there is really nothing to complain about. We really got friends with the owner Flor and we had one of the best times during our 3months trip in Mexico. Thank you"
50,"An absolute delight to stay here. The hosts Flor and  Oscar are wonderful people! We became very close during my stay and are going to be lifelong friends! The hostel is full of awesome vibes! Great parties every Friday! with great people! Right on the beach, I could literally see the sunset and the water from my bed! Super clean! Super good breakfast!  This is the spot to be at at La Punta!! And any questions, Oscar and Flor are more than willing to help! They got your back, made me feel at home in an instance! I ended up staying a month even though I was only supposed to stay a week. My La punta Family! I cant wait to see you all very soon! <3"
50,"Do I need to say more? This placed felt like a home and it was extremely hard to leave. Best place I've stayed in Mexico by far! Thanks Oscar and Flor for the good vibes and amazing music :) Oh, and I also reaeally enjoyed the Friday night parties!"
50,"Love this place, immediately felt like home when I arrived. Stayed for 3 weeks :  ) Location is awesome, right on the beach and just a few steps to the main street. Oscar and Flor are great hosts. Miss this place!"
50,"We had a great time here! The hostel is literally ON the beach and the sunset views are breathtaking!  The place is affordable, clean and perfect to know new people. They serve a really good breakfast and the staff is lovely and helpful, they made us feel like home. Puerto is a beautiful small town. If you're looking for an authentic small beach town experience this is the place you want to be.  Hope we can re turn soon!!"
50,"Stayed here 12 times over 10 years, here's why it's the best in a town that's filled with cool places to stay:  1. Awesome Owner   She opened it 20 years ago for the joy and it reflects that with a warm, colorful, upbeat look and that hosts all, from families to partyers  2.  Best Balance   In front of beautiful playa Carazalio, beginner/intermediate surf beach, yet cost efficient.  Everything within 30 min walk or less: main strip & beach / in town to local markets and restaurants / airport and bus station.  & a short caravan ride to la Punta, best intermediate beach.  Clean yet comfy.  Professional yet chill.  Amazing pool and variety of rooms from camping to private.  3.  The Bar  The entrance is open and mellow with a variety of spots to chill solo or in a group.  One of the"
50," Nice hostel with a pool and a good vibe.  Very social, especially the bar area. The beach is very close by and lots of restaurants in the same street. And if you want ,you can always ask to volunteer. They can always need help :)"
50,I really like this place and spend almost two weeks there. The hostel is big and have a lot space to hanging around. In the garden by the hammock or at the pool. Also have a bar to meet interesting people or practice the Spanish.
50,"A magical place where you will find new friends from all over the world. Everyone is really welcoming, staff and guests mix quite freely. There's a large indoor kitchen as well as an outdoor one, a swimming pool and hammocks to be lazy in. Prices are also very low with options for camping, shared dorm or private rooms. I came for two weeks and stayed for nearly three months and I met guests who have been coming back year after year. "
50,"Very nice place, colourful, very laid-back atmosphere. And the cheapest.  The staff is amazing <3 I felt like in family ! They're making this place a joyful hippy lair.  Everything is very close : transportation, nicest beaches, many options for eating in the street, laundry, convenient store. Amazing and clean pool. Bar, hammocks and wifi at the reception. Kitchen.  Not the cleanest hostel but the cheapest dorms and camping option in a nice area close to the pool with a lot of space, tables.. I was supposed to stay one day and stayed two weeks ! Thank you guys ! 🎵You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave 🎵"
30,"A very average place. It's cheep, it has a good service but that is the only things that are good. The toilets are not good, there is never paper and the sheets are smelly, the rooms are kind of open (for example in my case a cat got into the room when it was locked, and the WiFi is only in the reception."
10,"So we booked 2 private rooms for 8 days for myself, my girlfriend and 2 other friends.  Let me start by saying that it is absolutely not even a tiny bit close to the pictures on here. It is rundown beyond repair. Starting with our room, it leaked whenever it rained and soaked anything we left on the floor. Mosquito nets were full of holes. The toilet would block up almost everytime, you couldn't shower for longer than 5 minutes without flooding the room. We had a double bed and a bunk bed in the corner, the bunk bed had nail clippings on it. We had to ask for toilet paper everytime, not once was our room cleaned in our 8 day stay. On our last 2 days there was a problem with the water pipes apparently and the water coming out of the taps and shower was filthy, probably"
40,"Really good location, 5 minutes walk to Carrizalillo. Good price, close to bars and restaurants and easy access to the main ""strip"" and other beaches.   Each room comes with a fan, great atmosphere in the social area. We loved it so much ended up staying for 2 weeks!"
50,"its a big area but in the same time a cosy place with a nice pool and a beautiful reception area with a ""palapa roof top"". All the rooms have a fan and the price is really fair. Rigel, a mexikan woman run the place and she and Mathias are really helpful to book tours or rent a board! Supermarket and Restaurants just a step next door and the beach is 5 min walk. I had a great time and always like to come back."
40,"This hostel is in a great location! 5 minute walk to Carrizalillo beach, bars, restaurants, cafes, and convenience store. Walking distance to Puerto Angelito, Bacocho beach, Mercado Benito Juarez, and the Supermarket. Zicatela beach is an easy 30 minute walk or a 6 peso colectivo ride. We enjoyed our stay here, met some great people and loved the generous mango tree by the pool!"
50,"Incredible hotel room with the friendliest staff Puerto Escondido has to offer.  All rooms face the ocean.  Higher up the better the views. Yes for us old guys, an elevator is available.  Elizabeth is the Head Lady at this Hotel.  She speaks perfect English and has a smile to die for.  Continental breakfast included.  Super comfy rooms.  Highly recommend staying here "
50,Amazing place and class location! A short 2 minute walk to La Punta and all facilities are tops as well.   Pool areas and rooms are spacious as can be!   Make sure to stop into PEPES Fish tacos right around the corner also when you’re looking for a bite!
50,"My husband and I stayed in this well managed, reasonably priced hotel for one month in mid February to mid March and absolutely loved it! Our room was on the upper floor which had a huge terrace overlooking the pool, with lovely ocean breezes and spectacular sunsets! The suite itself was large, simply furnished with a small dining table and chairs (which we relocated to the terrace), and was complete with a full sized fridge and 2 burner hot plate in the kitchen area. This was all we needed as there were several great, budget friendly restaurants nearby. Although it is, for a few people, a little too far to walk to the ""main drag"" of Puerto Escondido, we personally loved the good 25 minute walk along the beach, which we did pretty much everyday. However, getting anywhere from"
50,"Incredibly helpful management,as were all the staff Top floor suite with ocean view A great place to watch sunset Needed to taxi or local transport into town but they were very cheap to use The room was kept immaculately clean by housekeeping They were very accommodating with luggage storage and showers on the last day, as we had to wait to get a bus at 1800hrs Stayed for 3 nights would highly recommend this place for either long stay or a few seconds days rest by the beach"
50,"Our room was on the second floor and we booked our reservation through Expedia. We had a wonderful visit and stayed 3 nights. The staff was very friendly and helpful and always ready to assist. The rooms were very clean and colorfully painted walls and bedding. The beds were comfortable. We had a suite that only cost $6 more dollars than a regular room. It was well worth it with plenty of space, a kitchenette and fridge to hold drinks for hot days and nights! The pool was refreshing in the evenings. Needs a little more upkeep and more plants around the fountain area and the poolside loungers were old and need new cushions. However, we just swam and then went back to our rooms to relax so it didn't bother us. The restaurant on site was open for breakfast so we ate there every"
30,"We spent 5 nights at the hotel in a normal double bedroom. What we liked about the hotel was the room itself, which was spacious, comfortable and had an air conditioner. This is plus since it is a budget hotel. The hotel staff is also very friendly and the pool itself is nice. What we disliked is the location which is indeed far away from the centre of Puerto Escondido and nice beaches like Carizarillo. Furthermore we had a dead cockroach in our closet the cleaning lady never put away. We would also have liked two towels per person and more water coming out of the shower. A further big minus is the breakfast which was a joke since it was served very late from 9 am on and included one hard bread, jam and coffee. To little even for a budget hotel. "
50,"Stayed in both the suites and the hotel and found the experience to be great. Very clean, well equipped, functional rooms with great, friendly service. Wonderful pool and grounds only 3 blocks from the beach. The suites have a large kitchenette and huge balcony. I had an upper level floor and watched the sunset from my hammock nightly.   The hotel was slightly cheaper in price but just as functional.   The location at la Punta is really great for those that want to be a bit out of the way but still very close to Puerto and Zicatela. Extremely quiet and undeveloped area.   Only downside was the breakfast: hardly drinkable coffee and packaged Bimbo toast. Still found the price/quality ratio to be high overall. Will come back again when next visiting Puerto. "
50,"We stayed here for 2 weeks with our 3 year old child.   The location is ideal if you are looking for a quiet area off the main strip where music can keep you awake until the wee hours of the morning. Its a short 10 minute walk along the beach in either direction to the Zicatela drag or the more laid back surfer area of La Punta. Cabs will take you to Zicatela (where there are many restaurants) for 25 pesos (about $2.50) in about 5 minutes, slightly less for La Punta.  The rooms are spacious and very clean. Beds are reasonably comfortable. You can open the balcony and room doors for a nice breeze off the ocean during the day. We turned the AC on in the late afternoon when the sun was directly on the face of the main building. At night windows (with screens) can be left open to"
50,"We really enjoyed our 5 nights here in February. Very clean, spacious, comfortable and friendly. The on-site restaurant, Las Iguanas, is also quite good. Thank you Vicente, Bertha, Elizabeth and Mari!"
50,"We've now stayed at Punta Esmerelda a handful of times in the last few years. It's quietly away from the main strip and surf scene, but close enough to easy walk to the beach and access either end of Playa Zicatela if you wish. The only noise is dogs and roosters, which is to be expected in the area. You are close to the local culture in a neighbourhood that appears to be growing and most of the locals are quite friendly. There are a number of corner stores within a few minutes' walk if you need a few items and there are always taxis in the area. Staff members are courteous and professional, always willing to help northerners practice their Spanish. For what we need and expect, it's a great deal to stay here for a week or two every year. Gracias."
50,"We had a very good time in Pacific Buddha Hostel in Punta Zicatella ;) The rooms are very cute and clean, the atmosphere relax ad chill and the owners are very very nice. Thank you so much for everything (especially for the shower after the tropical storm in Chacahua;) )  Taz and Félix"
20,"Overall I didn't enjoy my experience here. The place was dirty, the fridge was filthy and full of people's food. Maybe the mosquito problem is a problem with the area and not this specific hostel, I'm not sure, but once it was dark out, they were everywhere. Mostly the hostel has a strong  ""New agey"", ""hippy"" feel which might be something you like don't."
50,"We spent 9 Nights at the Pacific Buddha.  The Rooms are Clean and tidy. The Garden is Good to hang out and enjoy life. The Kitchen is well equipped and the toilets and showers are always Clean.  The Hosts know nearly Everything about Purto and how to get from a to b. They are very Friendly and create a familiar atmosphere.  Only downside: la punta is Changing and There is a Hostel in the Next street which does Loud Parties. I hope they shut down soon. In 9 Nights There were 2 loud Techno parties.  But if you go to La Punta: Stay at the Pacific Buddha. Its cheap, Clean, cozy and safe!  Of course Everything Else is within walking Distance. Downtown 50$ by taxi"
50,"My friends and I stayed there for 5 days during Christmas Time. We felt welcomed and like home. The Hostel is quiet and cosy (It is definitely no party Hostel but we Loved it and we met a lot of interesting people there). The couple who owns this place is friendly and helpful, we had some really nice chatting with them. For the 25th of December all the guests came together for Secret Santa and we had some nice food at the terrace. Not only the hammocks in the lovely garden but also the beds are more than comfortable.  Furthermore, the hostel is close to the beach La Punta and there are a lot of different restaurants and bars around. It is also easy to get to all the other beaches close by, like Mazunte or Zipolite. I can definitely recommend to stay at Pacific Buddha.  "
50,We really liked staying here. We extended our stay when we arrived. The location is great - just a two minute walk from a nice beach. Small market for groceries and restaurants nearby. Good kitchen in the hostel so cooking is an option. The dorm room was a good size. The beds were sturdy. The owner is really friendly and speaks great English. She is helpful. The garden area is very comfortable - hammocks and grass. The local pets (cats and dog) are friendly. The showers are cold but it was okay as the weather was so warm. This is definitely one of the best hostels we have stayed at during our 9 months travelling. Thank you Angie:)
50,"I stayed at Pacific Buddha about a month ago and this review is overdue! Small and intimate with just the right amount of character. Mine was a surf vacation...where I was looking to surf during the mornings and evenings and do some reading and work during the off times. Booked a private and was quite satisfied. Really enjoyed long conversations with other guests, especially Tyler, who was a wonderful host, friendly, kind and hospitable. I recommend highly!"
50,"There is nothing I didn't like about this place. The location is perfect, in a very chilled out area and only a 2 minute walk from the beach.  The owners live and work at the hostel so it was as if I were being welcomed into someones home, complete with lovely pets! The outdoor kitchen was one of my favourite things about the hostel.  It is a small hostel which allows for a really nice communal feel. I loved it!"
40,"We loved our stay at Pacific Buddha and there are just no complaints other than that the bed was a bit soft for my taste. Other than that, the place is super clean, the atmosphere was very relaxed and we met great people here. Only meters away from the beach, close to great restaurants and all the other activities you can do in this area. Laundry place next door. They have 2 cats and one very sweet dog that are always happy to be loved on but don't bother you in any way. Would highly recommend!"
10,"The hostel itself is very clean and in a great spot at ""La Punta"". It could have been a great stay except for the passive aggressive, petty behavior of the owners/management Tyler and Angelina. Their energy was very low and the complaining over petty issues hardly ceased during the entire stay. I felt like I was back in one of those bad housemate situations where the person doesn't confront you directly buy instead writes notes for you to find with more passive aggressive overtones... I would have left sooner if it wasn't for the fact that it was near on impossible to find alternative accommodation during this the busy Christmas and new year period...  What compelled me to write this negative review though was when Tyler on the last morning of our stay slammed my guitar down on"
50,"If you looking for a small, cosy, clean, unique and safe acommodation in La Punta area close to the beach, don't look any further ! Ty and Angelina create a bit of paradise here for everybody. They travelled and worked hard different hostels before, so they definately know, what do travellers need. Couple of years ago they had a chance to start there own hostels, where they can really put there heart in. When you enter you feel straight the special homey wibe.  The perfect location,  the little zen garden, colourful spacey rooms. the super clean bathrooms and the well equipped kitchen also helps to slow down a bit.  The special paintings, signes on the wall, the small details, christals, melody music, simple the good feeling, resonance make this place really unique and different"
50,"This place is  best I have been to in my 3 weeks in Mexico. The vibe here is perfect,  relaxed, friendly and  cool at the same Time. The owners are friendly and very kind and make u feel at home immediately. Go there! "
50,I was there in march 2009 and was supposed to stay for 3 days but ended up enjoying the place for a whole week and had hard time leaving. Pierre and the whole crew are such a good bunch of people and it felt like visiting friends. I'm still dreaming today of those hours drinking rhum coco by the beach and not having to care about anything but the wonders of the world. I would recommend this place forever. Enjoy!!
50,"This hostel turned out to be a real treat! The communal area is on the beach (but still private to the public) and after a few minutes of arriving I was meeting friends and drinking beer with my feet in the warm sand.   One thing I will say is the dorm I stayed in was far too warm- all of us in there were woken up very early in the morning because of the heat and the noise from people outside and dogs barking. Maybe it would have been better to pay half the price to sleep in a hammock outside on the beach, which I spent a lot of the day lying in anyway. If there are a couple of you it is probably worth the few extra pesos to stay in a cabana as they looked really nice.   The kitchen is good and there's no breakfast provided, but there are shops and restaurants and a nice bakery"
50,"The founders of this hostel have put all their heart and soul into this special place and I have seen that energy rubbing off and transforming everyone who stayed there. It is a beautiful, very affordable place full of helpful, interesting and lovely people. You will feel part of the community in no time."
50,"We were lucky to found this place while we were in Sayulitla. La buena onda is one of the best place I have stayed during all my travels...  People were friendly, and even the junkies were not that freaky because of the surrounding.   Located in front of the beach, this place offers everything you need to relax, get some waves, play volleyball, listen to music, and talk to a lot of different people.   Even if it is not mentionned in every guide book, this hostal offers some room if you have a tent, or some cabanes if you want to have more privacy and comfort.   The french owners were lovely. If all the owners were like them, this website wouldn't exist !  I highly recommend this place ! (especially for the youngest)"
50,"Buena Onda is definitely the best hostel I have stated in. The staff are lovely, they are always willing to help with anything and they put in the effort to learn everybody's name.  The hostel itself is just amazing & it has the best atmosphere. I couldn't have been more stoked.   I only wished we could have stayed longer. Take me back!!!"
50,"Recommended by 2 people this place did not disappoint in any way. Cabana huts are simple, comfortable, clean and very cheap. Located at la punta end of the beach (south end) it is a walk to zicatela for bigger waves, but the peaceful atmosphere and the friendly staff makes up for it massively. (There are waves out the front) The owners are the friendliest people I have met and are always willing to help out or share a laugh. It is extremely cheap and seems to attract good friendly travelers. There are places to eat across the road and drinks/beers/ice cream in house. Best place in puerto no doubt!"
30,"My friends and I had a really lovely stay at Nadja's home. Puerto Escondido is a really amazing town and this home is perfectly located in one of my favorite neighborhoods. Just a short walk or drive to the Rinconada strip where there's fantastic food & drinks to be had at a better price than off the Zicatella strip as it's less touristy in this area. You're also a very short drive/walk to some of the best beaches including Carazalillo, Hidden Beach (or Coral Beach), and Manzanillo all in this neighborhood. I was travelling and staying here with my husband, and 5 other couples, so 12 of us total and this home accommodated us quite well for our 2 week stay. 5/6 of the bathrooms have their own full ensuite which is very nice and all of the bedrooms are a good size. Unfortunately"
50,"I stayed for a little over a week with my friend! I loved this place so much, i literally wish i lived there! This kitchen is so nice and spacious and the owners are super sweet. We went surfing with them a few times and they were so friendly. LOVED THIS PLACE! I will always come back!"
40,We stayed there almost a week . The whole apartment is really nice even the kitchen downstairs is great . Everything you need you will find there . The whole family is really really nice . We would recommend to go there and stay for a while  Henrik y Svenja 
40,My girlfriend & I had 3 nights here & would happily stay again. Although not the most fantastic of facilities everything was clean & tidy & the host (Jarkov) was great & the pet dogs very friendly. We had everything we needed & could walk into Bacocho in less than 5 mins (great in that heat) & Puerto Escondido's only an extra 10 mins on top. Also the local beach is easily the nicest of the lot around here.
50,"I spent 9 nights in Casa Azul, and I very much enjoyed my stay! The hosts were very welcoming, I felt comfortable and secure. They were very helpful too and available to answer any questions and in addition, they made my stay very fun!   I took Pilates classes with Julia, and even though I had no experience in Pilates: WOW! She is good and sensitive to our fears, questions, personal body restrictions... Try it with http://goodvibrationspuerto.wix.com/yogapilates And her breakfasts were healthy AND delicious :)  I am also very picky for cleanliness, and I have nothing to say about that either!  The house is located in a calm neighbourhood (although you can hear dogs barking at night, but you get use to it), and it feels safe. I am a girl and was travelling alone, but I would"
50,"The bedrooms are nice and basic but what you come here for is the the beautiful, open window concept, communal kitchen. With a uniquely hand crafted counter top, a purified water tap and a brand new staneless steel stove with 6 burners. If you like cooking and you like living 10mins away from the best swimming beach in Puerto, than check out Casa Azul, it's worth a check in."
40,"I visited Casa Azul in December 2013. It is a comfortable and fresh guest house very close to Rinconada and Carrizalillo beach. Rinconada is a lovely touristic area full of little restaurants, some shops and cafés. In the end of the boulevard there is a place called Buffalo Wings, great place for sport events, good food and beer. There is a nice little cinema on the boulevard, as well, which has movie nights I guess every night. My favorite beach Carrizalillo is only 5 minutes walk away from the house. You can practice surfing there and the food is delicious. Casa Azul owners are from Puerto so they can give you the best local tips for where to go and what to do in town. I liked a lot the kitchen in the house. It was clean and well equipped and it is great to have the"
50,"Its a perfect place for stay, so near to carrizalillo beach and the comercial are, very peacefull area, and the rooms are very clean, the terreza its good because you can relax on the hammocks, or you can just spend all day at carrizallo, one of the cleanest beaches of puerto, i really would recommend to people who come for relax alone with friends or with a couple!  Also offers the transportation from bus station or the airport to the place :-)"
50,"The open air kitchen is lovely and the family who runs this place is very nice and very well connected in Puerto.  They can help you find anything you need, from surf lessons to yoga.  The neighborhood is residential and very quiet and seemingly safe.  We never had any issues walking around there.  It is just a few minutes to walk to the bustling Rinconada, and after that a few more minutes to the beautiful Carrizalillo beach.  Recommended!"
50,"Its a super nice place to stay in Puerto Escondido. The rooms are very clean, confortable and fresh! The kitchen is so nice and not to forget the hamacas to hang out :) U have free WiFi there! The place is near to the beautiful beach Carizalio. There u can take surf lessons or do other great water activities! Its also close to the street with many restaurants, cafes...nice! The service here is very good! It is a perfect place to relax and enjoy! Just come there and enjoy the life of Puerto Escondido! Thanks Casa Azul for this nice, friendly and perfect time!"
50,"Hello! I got married here at this beautiful Oceanside home on the 4th of March. Nineteen siblings and friends joined us at the house for 3 nights/ 4 days. The other nine guests stayed at the near by Villa Mozart. The owner of Villa Mozart and Junta al Mar are friends and they planned the entire event perfectly. When we first arrived, after a very ugly flight, we were warmly greeted by the host Tim and his staff. Because of flight troubles, Tim took it upon himself to charter us around to banks/exchange place…which when exchanging for 28 people takes quite a long time. All of the rooms were much larger than we had expected and very clean. Tom (my husband) and I had a very large room overlooking the ocean; it was like awaking to paradise each morning.

50,"we were traveling with 1 yo baby - it was a great stay - Tim took a great care of us ( he even picked us up from the airport), the place is very relaxing, great swimming pool with amazing view .... I hope we will be back and I would recommend this place to everybody. Thank you again Tim :)"
50,"I can't say enough good things about Oasis. Everyone that works at Oasis is super helpful and kind; making each day special. The surf lessons are top notch--the best I've ever had.  Cris, the head surf instructor, took the time to learn about my past surfing experience and understand what my goals were; providing excellent feedback to me after every ride and making it a very fun experience for me.  The group photo analysis was super helpful and you get to keep the photos!  I took the intensive Spanish lessons, which provides two 1.5 hour lessons each day.  Having two different teachers is awesome because you learn in a different way from each one.  Romi and Angie were simply awesome and very patient with me as I struggled through the lessons.  They are both committed to helping"
50,"We just came back from a trip to Puerto Escondido and stayed at La Barca for two nights. Honestly wish we could have booked more nights here! The entire place is so clean and beautiful. The pool was nice and fresh with a common area right next to it with a kitchen and dining area. We had one of the smaller rooms that don't have a kitchen included so had to use this to prepare a couple of meals.   The WiFi worked 100% the entire time and we had no problems with water or anything else. Our room did not include AC but with the fan it was definitely a lot fresher than other places we stayed at in Puerto Escondido.   The place is perfectly located as there is a street just two blocks away filled with restaurants, stores, bars and just a short walk away from Playa Carrizalillo. You"
50,"We loved everything about La Barca Surf House.  The family that owns La Barca lives on sight and was always there to make sure our stay was wonderful.  The rooms were comfortable and clean.  I loved the staff as well.  We were walking distance from the beach, restaurants, taxi rides, everything you could want plus more.  I loved how people would gather at the pool after a day on the beach for a nice swim and conversation.  I'm searching dates for us to go back for another stay at La Barca Surf House."
50,"We felt like we were part of an extended family! The family who runs the surf house is warm and friendly, helpful and kind! We loved our stay so much~ our room was peaceful and comfortable. The only negative is you will NOT want to ever leave this wonderful place!!! Had an amazing time and will absolutely be back! "
50,"La Barca offers a wide range of rooms/suites depending on what you need. I stayed in three different rooms, and all were clean with private bathrooms and mini fridges. Some rooms have full kitchens, patios/balconies, and even more than one bedroom.  There is a large outdoor kitchen/dining area next to the pool, which is really nice for longer stays, if you want to cook. It also helps you to meet other guests, and allows for a convenient place to hangout in the evenings.  The owners (Sol and Roger) were very kind and accommodating. Overall, I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Puerto Escondido. I can't wait to visit again!"
50,"-100% clean - Staff very helpful - Location: beach, restaurants and shops walking distance. - Great place to meet people. - The owners are lovely and amazing host, always helping you out! - Solo travelers, honeymooners or on a friends trip you are going to have a good time!"
50,"An amazing complex of several apartments with people from all over the world, the apartments are very big, comfortable and clean. If you feel like cooking, most of them have a kitchen. in the center of the complex there is a nice pool, a bar and some tables to relax and read.  The owners Sol and Roger are very nice people, and you can be sure that they will help you with anything you need.  The cool thing about La Barca Surf House‬ is that even if most of Puerto Escondido will be empty on low season, in La Barca Surf House‬ there will always be people (:"
50,"This apartment was incredible. Everything you could possibly want - great kitchen, beautiful room and bathroom, terrace, pool... The location is great - right near the beach, a strip of restaurants and walking distance (~10-15min) to the centre of town. The owners were so lovely and went out of their way to help us out. Do yourself a favour and stay here!"
50,"Our family of 4 (2 boys 13 and 16) stayed at the La Barca house for a month while we surfed, took Spanish lessons, and my husband worked in the hospital.  We would highly recommend it to a variety of people - singles, couples, families.  The apartments are perfect with a little kitchen for all our needs.  The common area (bigger kitchen, eating area and pool) are a great place to hang out and socialize and meet other people.  The pool was perfect for the kids and to cool off when it got hot.  The grounds and all the spaces were exceptionally well taken care - clean and in excellent condition. All staff were very helpful and friendly - they were happy to take care of any needs we had or assist us in any way that they could.  We now consider Sol and Roger (and their kiddos) family"
50,"La Barca surf house is a really nice place to stay no matter what is the purpose of your trip. The appartments are really nice and clean, you will have all you need there. There is also a beautiful commun area with a kitchen and a pool, which is really good to meet other people. The owners of La Barca leave there with their family and they make everything they can to make your stay the most enjoyable. It was my second time here, and I will come back soon for sure."
30,"People were entering without masks but other safety measures were in place.   Food & service were OK. No hot tea available for this non coffee drinker. We each had a breakfast special of sorts. Coffee or OJ, Some soft, sweet, tasty bread, eggs to order, over chilaquiles. $160 MXN per person."
50,"Stayed only one night but the place is very nice. Staff is great. The pool is clean, indeed the whole Hotel is super clean, it smells good all around. The room is huge !! Beach is right across the street. Kitchen has the view on the beach"
30,"I spent 3 nights in this hotel in February 2016 with an italian group called ""avventure nel mondo"". Puerto Escondido is a well known place for surfers and most part of the clients of the hotel were indeed surfers. To reach the reception you pass through the bar of the hotel, which is nice, full of young people going also there to eat, drink and enjoy the nice view. Place is seafront, you just cross the street and you are on the beach, full of restaurants and bars. We got rooms on the top floor. This had advantages and disadvanages. Plus is definitely the fact that once you get there the view is great, relaxing and equipped with amoca, chairs and small table. Disadvantage are the huge amount of stairs you have to climb to get there. When we arrived, with my 20KG luggage, i got up"
50,We came in low season and were pretty much the only ones staying there so vibe wasn't fab. However for the price it was well worth it. The pool was lovely and cool and the location was as good as it gets!   Dorms are pretty simple and mattresses not great but lovely staff
40,Loved the location and view. Taxi far is so inexpensive that you can almost get anywhere in Puerto Escondido for under $2.50 Canadian...that is the most we ever paid. Our first week we stayed in the apartment with the few of the avenue and Zicatela surf. The size of the room apartment was nice and roomy. For us we found it a bit noisy because of the street noise and night life...but that is just us. Our second week we stayed at the Casa con hermosa vista (House with the Beautiful View) located in the back of Casa Chicatana that they manage. Best place ever...it is a million dollar view mixed with rustic and modern accommodations with lots room for a group or family...more than a few stairs to get there but worth it and great exercise. The food in the restaurant was
20,"I'll start with the good: The staff was very helpful, Room was spacious, The nearby restaurant has nice Frapuccinos, There was a refrigerator in the room, The Location is good (if most of your interest is surfing and you wish to stay in Playa Zicatella). The full story: I don't surf and for some reason I was sure that Playa Zicatella is the best place to stay in Puerto Escondido. I guess that the next time I'll come, I'll stay in Punta, but Zicatella is probably more interesting during the nights. During the days I preferred to go other beaches. I booked a single room with private bathroom in advanced. When I arrived there, the room wasn't ready. After waiting in the nearby restaurant for another hour, they gave me a room in an apartment where the bathroom was outside the room"
40,"This was my first experience in a solo travel, and also my first experience in a hostel. But for me it was just fine. The place is great, very well located. On the best beach of Puerto. The environment was cool, a lot of people from all around the world. The service on the from desk was beyond than good. I definitely recommend this place. "
40,"The good: it is really good located, has a great staff,  a small pool, a good restaurant, a convenience store next door and a cool vibe. It is great to meet people. The bad: A single room with a really bumpy mattress and a window without a curtain is 900 pesos per night. Also, it is unbelievably loud at night  (which isn't exactly their fault but anyway) and the music doesn't stop till 3 am.  In conclusion, it is good to party and make friends but not to have good night's sleep.   "
40,"I was at casa Chicatana for about 4 nights in mid December and had a great stay. Place is kept clean, the pool is a big bonus for when you're too lazy to walk across the road to the beach. Has security at night, and the workers are extremely helpful if you have any queries. Playa zicatela can get pretty noisy at night, so if you're not going to be partying every night bring some earplugs. Would stay again"
50,"We spent 2 weeks here at Casa Chicatana. It's in a great spot on Zicatela Beach. It's in close proximity to restaurants, shops & to the main road for collectivos & buses.  Only 1.5km from the main bus terminal too. I loved that there was a swimming pool, as sometimes the ocean does not give you the cool relief that you need on a hot day! Great place to meet fellow travellers. There's also 2 kitchens located on site. Otherwise there is a restaurant located out front of the hostel that does great burritos! A laundry service is also provided (although I had an issue with it, the staff went out of their way to make my experience better. I really appreciated this). Joe who is always on the desk during the day is super friendly and great for advice of the area. The only complaint I"
50,"As soon as we arrived, we were treated not as guests but part of the family! We have made lifelong friends! The rooms are simple but clean and adorable, the pool is truly amazing and the common area is a great place to hang out and catch a soccer game on the big screen tv or play some darts. We truly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to family and friends!"
50,This is an annual event for approximately 40 of us.  We rent the entire resort for a 3 day weekend every year in August.  The location is great and with recent update in continually improving.  If you're going do your shopping before you arrive.  One grocery store in town but Piedmont has a great meat market.
50,"What a wonderful place to relax and enjoy life!! We loved it so much! Rooms are comfortable and clean. The place is built very well and beautifully. There is many areas to hang out, depending if you want to be social or just quiet. Al and Chris are so chilled and relaxed, if you don’t know how to relax before , you will learn while you’re there!! Even the people staying were all cool!!! We love it, and recommend it highly! And hope to return soon again!! Thanx Chris and Al, hugs!!"
50,"My wife and I stayed at Sunset Point and we give it top marks. The rooms are comfortable, well-priced and wide-ranging to cater for most tastes. Thankfully, Sunset Point does not follow the formulaic approach of so many hotels/motels/resorts. Sunset Point Resort has been created by Chris Rex, formerly a mechanical engineer and one of the owners. The rooms are furnished in what he calls a ""minimalist"" style, which is true enough, so don't expect Hilton- or Best Western-type furnishings. Instead, think of a personal vision for a resort in keeping with local designs and materials, and one that is more than adequate for accommodating Western guests. Sunset Point has a good 18-metre pool and a very social communal area. Chris is personable and will help you with arrangements for"
50,"My husband and I wanted a nice relaxing get away. We found it at Sunset Point with the beautiful pool and pool side loungers and shaded hammocks! We read books, swam walked into town for romantic dinners or drinks. We stayed a month and loved it! Chris the owner was amazing he was very welcoming and did everything he could to make out holiday a great one. We enjoyed the ability for outdoor cooking and eating on our private patio and had large jugs of purified water supplied to us at no additional cost. We also had a group dinner with Chris and some of the other guests in the main Kitchen and common area which was amazing.  The room is minimalistic with your basic needs so don't come if your a princess expecting to be pampered. We loved the  beautiful gardens and every room is"
50,"I stayed in one of the garden apartments for six weeks,and the time I spent was peaceful,and totally relaxing. Air conditioning,pool,communal dinners and outings,clean well kept suite,beautiful landscaping,good friendly staff and management. I will definitely return.    Les"
50,Incredibly friendly service in a beautiful tropical setting.  Basic clean facilities at tremendous value.  Very hard to beat if you're on a budget.  Will certainly be going back when I can afford the time.
50,"Sunset Point is in a great location to visit the town of Puerto Escondido and the beach. A ten minute walk to the beach or a ten minute walk to the local collective transit to take you into the local Marcado.  The communal kitchen is a great place to meet and mingle with  new or returning guests.  There have been many potluck dinners held there, not to mention pizza nights from the wood burning pizza oven."
50,"Stayed for 6 weeks, had a great time  All the guests got along great,  will come back again if in Puerto Close to beach  (8 mins) but far enough away to avoid the sometimes loud music at night  Free bottled water and wifi was nice "
50,"Our trip couldn't have been better - spacious rooms, huge pool, our own kitchenette and probably the best view in Puerto. We spent 4 months here during the surf season and it was epic - just a short walk down the hill to some great restaurants, a health food store and the beach. We rented a motorbike so we could surf and have the freedom to really explore the town. Puerto has one of the best markets we've ever seen - amazing fresh produce and so good to have our own kitchen - massive money saver! The owner Rex is a legend and looked after us so well - honestly couldn't recommend this place enough."
40,"Near beach, great rooms, no frills but wonderfully romantic and the price tough to beat, friendly staff, no A/C but not needed + hammocks"
50,"A friend and I spent almost two weeks at the Hotel Santa Fe in Puerto Escondido in October and November, 2011.  The location of the hotel right across the street from a lovely ocean beach in a town that does not have a long list of activities for tourists means that you can relax and de-stress very easily.  There are two lovely pools with plenty of poolside seating and shade from overhanging palm trees, as well as luscious drinks from the bar.  The grounds of the hotel are a feast of greenery for the eyes.  And the beautiful sunsets over the ocean disappear too quickly, signifying that another day of your vacation in such a paradise is over.  The town of Puerto Escondido is within walking distance for some, a taxi ride for others.  It's a fun place to poke around, and the locals"
50,"My boyfriend and I took a trip to Puerto Escondido from Xmas to New Years day. We stayed at the charming and wonderful Santa Fe Hotel, based on a recommendation from one of my bf's golf buddies. Wow, what a wonderful recommendation it was! The hotel is located literally across the street from the beach. City Beach is just to your right as you exit the hotel. It's where more locals go and you can find wonderful little beach restaurants that have lounge chairs and they will serve you margaritas and cervezas all day long for a good price. Service is outstanding in general and they work very hard to make you happy. To the left of the hotel is the main drag along the beach. Lots of cute shops and restaurants and again, many many beach restaurants who all vie for your lounge chair"
30,"This hotel must be charging what they do based upon.....?  Well, I'm not really sure.  We paid $180 per night for a non-view room, which is just outrageous compared to other neighboring hotel choices with ocean views.  Yes, the grounds are very, very pretty.  Yes, the restaurant service is excellent.  Yes, the rooms are spacious.  Still, it wasn't a 5 star hotel and I think better value would be found elsewhere.  They allow hawkers to set up their items for sale right at the hotel entrance, so you are immediately greeted by people trying to sell you stuff.    Do not get room 32.  It's front window faces the linen closet outside, where the cleaning staff have to go in and out all day, and the rear balcony faces the service entrance for staff- so on either side you must keep your"
50,"My husband and I stayed at the Santa Fe for a week November 2011.  The staff was more than accommodating, the rooms were wonderfully kept, and the breakfast was amazing.  We didn't have a ""view""-but you really don't need one.  The ocean is steps away.  The room was spacious (huge closet), and housekeeping even picked up my clothes off the floor.   The location is great. Right on Zicatela, but on the quiet end.  It's super easy to walk out the doors of the Santa Fe and hail a cab to the most beautiful swimming beach ever-Carrizalillo. (20 pesos will get you there-make a deal prior to getting into the cab).   1. Always order fruit juice at the Santa Fe: orange, pineapple, etc.  It's amazing.  It's fresh.  Yum. 2. Eat breakfast at Santa Fe (hotcakes con fruta is the way to go),"
30,"Pros: -Clean Hotel -Good Restaurant -Decent Badroom -Nice Pool  Cons: -Uncomfortable bed (the hard one you usually get on cheaper hotels) -Ant and mosquito problem -The room are very Noisy. -The pillows smelled like mold  In conclusion. It's not a bad hotel, but I would expected a better hotel for the priced I paid."
50,"We went in August 2010 and stayed in Puerto through September. We arrived by bus, after 9 slow hours, at 4:00 am and we warmly greeted and showed a few rooms for us to choose from. Lovely warm atmosphere and helpful staff that speaks good english.   We rented a house but continued to go back to eat there. The food was consistantly good and the Tamales are out of this world!!!! I hate tamales but after 2 months decided to brave one after the waiter said they were fantastic....he was right...nothing like I am used to, mainly big gluey mass of corn meal in a corn husk...noooo, amazing subtle sweet sauteed vegetables and a thin layer of corn meal folded flat in a banana leaf. YUM.   You can`t beat the place!!!"
40,"I recommend Hotel Santa Fe.  The architecture and layout is lovely, the grounds well-kept, clean, and generally quiet, the staff pleasant and helpful, and the location ideal (just across the street from the beach, and midway between the surfer-rastafarian scene to the south versus the old-town local charm to the north ... if you're interested in seeing a little of both, you can't pick a better site).    If you don't feel like making the ""long"" trip down the the beach, you can hang out by one of the pools, or on the extensive patio (and restaurant) overlooking the ocean.  I worked through a lot of rum and reading overlooking the ocean on that patio ...  In the ideal world, more of Santa Fe's rooms would have a view (as it is, only a handful of rooms nearest the beach offer that"
40,"Puerto Escondido is a haven for those wishing to go cheap.  However if you have finally realized you can't take it with you and that the kids will use your money to buy Oakleys, stay here.  It isn't expensive,  except by Puerto Escondido standards, and  It is very nice.  Unlike alot of the surfing strip locations it is calm and comfortable.  Well located for walks on Zipolito ,the sufers beach, or playa municipal, the family beach it is a great place.  The restaurant with, a strong vegetarian offering, is excelent, the lap pool is lovely, the rooms are more than adequate.  Internet was iffy although access from the formidable coffee shop underneath the hotel was always good.   The views from the patio and from the restaurant are lovely."
30,A great location just across the road from the beach. Service was good and the staff were pleasant. Swimming pools were good and well maintained. Restaurant was good for breakfast (advertised International cuisine but no meat not even chicken and too many vegetarian dishes). We booked a Jr. Suite 4 months ahead and were given a suite in the old part of the hotel which was overlooking a noisy road and smelled of mold (It did not look anything like the photos on their web site).  We finally moved to a newer suite after a week. We have been vacationing in Mexico for over forty years and thought we had read between the lines of the reviews ... were sadly disappointed in the Santa Fe.
40,Great staff. Prime location - right on the beach.  Beautiful hotel - like a Spanish villa.
10,"I came first before booking and wasn’t impressed with the facilities (and I’m not picky) but figured all the reviews can’t be wrong. I was hoping the vibes would be enough. I had maybe one positive exchange with another guest. And the one staff member I really interacted with, Olivia, a non-local, was really helpful but otherwise I wouldn’t waste my time or money. I never met or saw the owners people rave about. Definitely no family vibes. People aren’t particularly friendly with newcomers (felt cliquey, and outside of the cliques people kept to themselves), the dorm itself is extremely basic, the shared bathroom just a touch below disgusting. Dirty floors, dirty shower, complete with mounds of someone’s hair and a trash bin full with poopy/bloody tissues. Having ants in a"
50,"Very good atmosphere, good music and sometimes parties and  meals together. The people who run the hostel are nice and helpful.. They give good information and organise trips. One can rent a van to go to other places (good utilities and beds in the van). The hostel is clean, good beds and showers, there are plants and beautiful paintings. The rooftop has beautiful views. From the hostel it is only a one minute walk to the beach. The collectivos pass the hostel, so it 's very easy to go where ever you want."
50,"Outstanding hostel. Friendly and welcoming hosts. The kitchen has everything you need plus there’s a barbecue. Excellent coffee at a very fair price. You can bring in your own alcohol as there’s no bar. Plus the location couldn’t be better; a hundred meters to the beach and a five minute walk to the centre of La Punta.  The hostel is very social; with a few main social areas you quickly get talking with other travellers. The hostel would definitely benefit from a pool table or table tennis table, although not essential.  I’d certainly return to Akumal and would recommend to friends.  Thanks Erick and Sabi for a great stay."
50,Such a great place to stay in La Punta! Short walk to the beach and food places. Amazing strong coffees in morning. The rooms were clean and tidy. The common areas are really nice and a great place to chill when the heat gets too much. Good kitchen facilities too. Would highly recommend! 
50,"I stayed for a week but could have stayed a lot longer! The perfect mix of chill and social vibes with the beach and cafes really close. If you like to cook the kitchen is great too! Our room was perfect and we really enjoyed the complimentary bottle of champagne, fresh bread, and cheeses on arrival, Thanks Erick you're a lord! ;)"
50,"I stayed at Hostel Akumal and I really enjoyed the time there!! Erick was great, easy going, glad to help us in everything he could and made our stay really comfortable. If you want to be in a quiet area of Puerto Escondido (Punta Zicatela) but still have a good atmosphere at your hostel and have some beers with the other travellers at the end of the day, Hostal Akumal is the place for you :)  Thanks Erick for everything!!"
30,"Very very chilled out hostel, good for solo travelers. The manager is very sociable, helpful and relaxed and definitely makes you feel at home. However, he kind of does everything at the hostel and we felt like there needed to be a cleaner. The bathroom bins were not emptied regularly so overflowed and the empty dorm beds were not cleaned for more than a day. Little kitchen to cook in and lots of little shops close by to get groceries! "
50,"Very well run, great value for the price. The owners have created a laid back and comfortable atmosphere with wonderful common spaces. It is a short taxi ride to Zicatela, located in a quieter part of Punta Zicatela. Highly recommend!"
50,"This hostel is nothing short of magical. The location is amazing, a stones throw from the beach. The common spaces are beautiful, with art on every wall and beautiful plants and greenery to enjoy no matter where you're hanging out. The owners and staff are kind, helpful and generous, and the overall vibe is friendly and inviting. I highly recommend this to anyone travelling solo (as I was), I met some fantastic people at Akumal. Was there for ten days and it felt like home.......! <3"
50,"This is my love letter to Akumal:  I stayed in the hostel for a month and a week.   My joy's never been so intense, in truth.  Guiltily happy, stupidly happy—dazed with joy.  And this is the fault of the kind people I met at Akumal.  Real family; and I leave for a time, but a great part of my spirit stays, keeping watch, keeping house, with my people—my friends.  Simply in arriving, I knew something was good:  Chloe met me at the door with a grand smile, the type disarming, trust like an immediacy.  A welcome home, to a home I did not know existed until I stepped across the threshold.  A month and a week, 36 days, and the time was like gold; though I'm far from being able to count each day.  The days blazed, like a heat:  all becoming a grand sun, a one without a setting—one (a"
50,Just returned from a wonderful week with Claudia. She is a marvelous hostess and made me feel like family from the moment she picked me up at the airport. Her staff has been with her a long time and all were professional and very attentive to whatever I needed. It was the best part of PE.
50,"This place is a rare find.  The quality of cabinets, construction, bath and plumbing fixtures is top of the line.  My room looked brand new and spotlessly clean. The full kitchen included water and coffee.  It is a ten minute walk to the beautiful Carrizalillo beach steps, and a 40-50 peso ride to anywhere in Puerto Escondido. The top floor Palapa deck is spacious, airy, ocean views, and hammock equipped. The best part is meeting Claudia, so kind, thoughtful, and classy. I will return."
50,"I was looking for a place that paid a lot of attention to details, both in the room and in the service, where I felt my things were completely safe, and offered great value for the price, and this boutique hotel on a quiet residential street within a short walk of Carizalillo Beach exceeded my expectations in every way.     The room was a suite, more like a nice apartment, with a front and back porch, kitchen, dining and sitting area, and nice-sized bedroom. Everything was super clean, tasteful and fresh. Claudia makes you feel welcomed and taken care of with her thoughtful professional service, going out of her way to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The rooftop palapa, along with your front and back porch, adds yet another great space to relax, with a big hammock,"
50,Claudia was a wonderful host . The staff were very nice and cleaned our room even though we were not scheduled to have it done. We would love to return. Prices were very reasonable and close to many beaches and restaurants.
50,"Our title says it all:  we returned to Casa de los Angeles for a third straight year.  We love being within such close walking distance to both the Rinconada, Playa Carrizalillo, and Playa Bacocho.  The one-bedroom units all contain a kitchenette and are perfectly sized.  The third floor palapa, with its gas bbq and hammock are icing on the cake.  During our stay this year, all six units boasted repeat long-term renters, which is such a great testament to how Claudia runs her business.  She has a generous, service heart.  And the building is clean and well maintained from year to year.  Great friendly staff - Leo, Oved and Nayeli do a wonderful job keeping the place spic and span, and are always happy to lend a hand.  Wifi was upgraded last year and works very well.  A rinse-off"
50,"This is my first review on TripAdvisor, but I really felt like this place deserves it.  Claudia made me feel so welcome, and the rooms and building are immaculate and so tranquil.  The palapa (terrace) on the roof was a major highlight, complete with a brand new grill, stove, dish wear, and tables to dine al fresco in the evenings.  And the room was very cool in the hot weather, thanks to a well-operating air conditioner.  Despite the tropical conditions, there were no bugs in the room (more than I can say for anywhere else I stayed Claudia took time to show me around town and even took me shopping at the local market.  When I got sick, she was very helpful in getting me to a terrific doctor (her friend).  This was by far the best hotel I visited in Puerto Escondido, and it"
50,"Wonderful place to stay. Excellent installations, very clean, extremely comfortable and beautiful rooms. Very well equipped. Owner makes your stay worthwhile. Located in an excellent spot near beaches and all amenities. Have stayed in other hotels in the area in the past, and there is no comparison. I highly recommend it!"
40,"We have been staying at La Casa de Los Angeles for 5 seasons now.  The apartments are tastefully designed and offer amenities required for long stays. We have stayed from 5 weeks to 4 months. The bedrooms have AC, king beds and balconies or patios. The palapa roof is common area and with little notice it is available for you to host  dinner with friends and family, with a SS BBQ included. Laundry facilities, spa and fitness equipment and computers and printer round out the additional offerings. The grounds are well maintained as are the condo units.  3 staff members are available to look after the guests and property. We feel safe and comfortable at all times. This is a great place to spend the winter and much of this is due to Claudia's attentive care.   La Casa de Los Angeles"
50,"We are currently staying at this Boutique style inn, and have been super happy with our experience to date.  Claudia is a very gracious host with excellent English skills, and she and Alvaro have provided lots of small touches along the way, from picking us up at the airport to taking us to the Super Che grocery store and Mercado, as well as other area tips.  She even bought me some pedialyte when I was under the weather.  An amazing, passionate responsive business owner with a service heart.  She is well connected in the community as well.  One of the reasons that there may not be that many reviews here on this site is that the majority of the clients are repeat visitors, with some staying for extended periods of time.  We were referred here by folks that retrun every winter,"
40,"This property offers visitors the comforts of a nice bedroom with a separate living/dining/ kitchen area and some outdoor space.  We have stayed in four of the six units for varying time periods, several times for three months.  Some bedrooms have limited clothing storage for long stays.  It was not possible to hang dresses up properly until we brought over-the-door hooks to use on the bedroom door.  The kitchens are not well equipped for long stays but work very well for shorter stays of a few days to a week or two.  On the other hand, the units are available for long stays.  We supplemented the kitchen with the cooking utensils we needed and a toaster oven for roasting and baking.  The new rules imply that my approach may not always be possible, however.  The owner has begun"
50,"We loved our stay at Nhis Be Suites. The room was fantastic and clean with a nice view (although the view is better from the rooftop). Nice kitchen, all the utensils we need to actually cook which is a nice change from some places. Great pool and a short walk (4mins) to the beach and bars and eateries, which was perfect so we didn’t hear any music when we went to bed.  Abel, was fantastic and whatever we needed he sorted for us and was incredibly accommodating."
50,"We couldn’t recommend Nhis Be Suites any higher!! Tucked away only a 5 minute walk from La Punta town, it feels like you are in your own oasis as you sit on your balcony overlooking the lush green valley. Each of the 7 suites are unique, with a lot of thought that has gone into the design to make them feel spacious and cosy, with top quality furnishings. We stayed in the Yuxhi suite for 9 nights and for 2 of us there was more than enough space with 2 seating areas and a fully decked out kitchen. Other highlights were the pool- top maintenance and refreshingly cold water with a range of sun lounges or hammocks in the shade, the rooftop deck (the highest around!) where again you can lounge in hammocks and watch the sun set/moon rise beer in hand. Yet another highlight was the"
50,"I stayed for a week at Nhis-Be Suites, and everything was perfect, the suites are very comfortable and are located very close to ""La Punta Beach"" in Zicatela, it's a very peaceful place with a lot of facilities, the staff was very helpful and kind and over all our vacations were very nice, i highly recommend to visit Puerto Escondido and stay at Nhis-Be Suites."
50,"For sure it is a great place to stay, first of all is brand new, they just opened last Eastern, they have very comfortable fully equipped suites, very clean, quiet and with great views. Located just a short walk from La Punta Beach, close to shops, restaurants and cafes; but more important close to one of the best surf spots of the area. The host is very kind and willing to listen to your needs and always helpful."
40,"I stayed 4 nights in that hostel while taking surf lessons in a schhol down the road. The location is perfect as it's right in the middle of Punta Zicatela, the bohemian part of Zicatela. There is a club right next door so it can get noisy at night, especially since there is not much soundproofing. The hostel is full of sweet cats and dogs that will follow you. The owner is the most stereotypical Mexican man and he is so funny, opportunity for interesting conversations"
50,"This hostel was awesome! Right on the beach, with a slackline set up and beach volleyball games every night at sunset. Everyone was really welcoming and friendly, creating a wonderful community atmosphere. It had a great shared kitchen, plenty of hammocks and a big common space where everyone would hang out. The hostel was clean and cool, every bed had its own fan! I stayed in the dormitories but there are also private rooms and camping space. The location couldn’t have been better- you could run to the beach in under 10 seconds, and the main convenience/food stores are just around the corner. I would highly recommend."
10,"Location is great. However, they have a bar right there, which plays loud music until the morning, disturbing the whole neighborhood. I would not stay there again, because I did not get enough sleep and I am not interested in partying each night."
50,I was suppose to stay 1 night and I stayed 4 nights. I love the communes areas that have hanging beds. Staff was super attentive and present for any need. The place was clean and good environment! I will return for sure!  Maria-clara
50,"This place is in La Punta Zicatela, at the very edge of Puerto Escondido, which makes it even cooler, because a short walk on the beach will take you to a magical isolated beach. Zapotecas is perfectly located on the beach and right in the middle of La Punta, so everything the area has to offer (restaurants, bars, organic stores, grocery stores, etc.) is within a 5 minute walk from home. The private rooms and dorms are rustic but very clean, comfortable and incredibly cheap! Each bed has its own fan! A thing I found that made this place unique was that THERE WERE MORE STAFF MEMBERS THAN GUESTS, and they were all super friendly and hard working. I immediately felt like family. To top it all off, one of the staff, Ali, made delicious bread every morning on the kitchen oven, and"
50,"I loved Zapotecas so much! I stayed there for 2 monthsas a volunteer.  I don't know what is it about it, but I knew so many really amazing people in that hostel. The commun area is a great plaece to chill, meet new people, eat a delicious meal self preppared, play chess, etc. in front of the ocean. You have the hammocks area in wich you can chill as well, Its economic with a perfect location, amazing people, the environment in general there is very relaxed and chill invites you to have the best vacations ever! :) cheers for this amazing place, definitely the most interesting in la Punta!"
50,"Zapotecas is en experience itself. I came to spend 5 nights, I've spend 4 months in this paradise. If you are looking for a human experience, it's the place you want to be. The form and the structure of the hostel may look unusual to you, and it's totally the idea. You are just in front of the sea, you can sleep on the swinging bed listening to the sea and watching at the beach. The main particularity of the place, the volunteers that are made as a Tribu and make the place so special. I've met so fantastic people. The kitchen is the main place of the hostel, large and very confortable to cook, looking at the sun dying into the ocean. If you are looking for a nice and peaceful classic hostel, this is not the place you are looking for. My experience there was a life changing"
50,"Never felt so at home at a ho recstel. The whole crew is amazing, it feels like one big family! The location is perfect: you are literally sleeping at the beach and you can hear the sea during night! Everyone is warmhearted, its a ver special place. Can recommend it for sure!"
50,"As soon as you walk out of the hostel you step onto the beach. A fruitshop, a minisupermarket and several nice cafés right across the street. The vibes are great here and the people are so nice! The hammocks are perfect for an afternoon nap and the freshly baked bread every morning is really nice. It has a big kitchen in which you can cook some food for yourself (and the rest of the hostel). Overall, this place has made my experience in La Punta!! A must-go!"
50,Great stay. Excellent staff. The stay was great fun and all the bar staff there helped us a lot. Will hopefully come back when I return to Mexico next year. The rooms were really nice aswell and extremely comfortable
50,"We’re a group of four staying in Merida and Erin is our host at our rental. She’s not only a SuperHost; she also led our group of 4 through a large market to shop for lunch. Along the way, we tasted samples as she talked about local culinary products and traditions. Then, we returned to her house to cook. The result was a delicious lunch. Erin is very personable and knowledgeable. It was interesting to discover new foods and learn how they might be prepared."
50,"I think the previous revieuws give a good picture of the hostel. It has a perfect location, literally on the beach. The kitchen is big and during my stay we had several shared (low-budget) dinners. It’s easy to make contact with the guests due to the common area. They also pay a lot of attention to recycling, which I can totally appreciate. I really enjoyed my time here and like a lot I diceded to stay longer then I had in mind when I arrived. Despite that I can imagine that this isn’t the best place for you if you’re really fond of privacy and you shouldn’t expect the same level of hygiene you have in a hotel. "
50,This place is amazing. It has a great vibe with even better people. The staff are lovely and so helpful. The pool Is great to chill around in the day and the location couldn’t be better. Easy taxi ride into down and right by the beach and strip if you want to go out. Has lovely views of sunset and the bar prices are incredible. Would definitely come again and would recommend to anyone. Thank you so much
50,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hostel.  The beds are amazing and the party seen is great.  Met a lot of cool people.  It is much better and cleaner than the Selina.  Also, the owners and staff are nice and try to create an inclusive environment for everyone.  This is what hostels should be..."
50,"Best place in puerto, great location, amazing staff, beds are so good and sick vibe! They also run different activities every night so super easy to connect with people! Big shoutout to phoebe and Seb!"
50,"I’ve been traveling around  in Mexico now for nearly 6 months and this is hands down the best hostel I’ve stayed in here. There’s always good vibes, the staff is amazing and I met so many friends there during my stay! Definitely definitely definitely recommend!! 5 stars ⭐️"
50,"Best party hostel I've been to everything was fun, clean and chill. Lots of events but quiet rooms. Things that can improve is only that people don't enter the dormshowers with sand take the outdoor shower before the dorms if you have a lot of sand. Also I got a bed with an ac which was super cold but could easily change with someone else vuz everyone's so nice!"
50,"Lovely hostel, bartender Maira was super lovely! Maybe the nicest bartender I’ve met in Mexico. Nice pool and room and close to the beach. Everyone here is very friendly and there is a warm atmosphere when you arrive. Will definitely come back in the future. 🤠"
50,"Amazing hostel, from the minute I arrived I was welcomed with a complimentary beer. Excellent location by the beach and a wide range of activities means you will never be bored at Bonita Escondida. Great night life, friendly people I couldn’t ask for anything more :) "
50,"the best place to be in puerto escondido, in la punta, 5min from the beach, different event every day, confortable, amazing volonteer people working there, helpful, and always here for you. this hostel deserve it's reputation, i'll will always recommand this place"
50,"I love Bonita Escondido it’s an amazing hostel with brilliant staff, so easy to socialise and I’ve made so many amazing friends here, the events they through for the guests are amazing you need to do trivia night!! 10/10"
50,"2nd time staying here. Checks all the boxes in terms of what you look for in a surf hostel with amazing amenities. Pool is secluded, cafe is unbelievable, staff is chill, and proximity to la Punta is unbeatable."
50,"So glad we found this place. We booked for 2 nights but ended up staying for 6 as we didn't want to move on in the end. We had a small but simple and well thought out room for the first few nights, then got moved to the dorm room all to ourselves so we had loads of room! The place has a lovely calm feel about it, a lovely pool to soak in and amazing showers. Cafe Ole which is on site serves delicious food and you can take this onto the terrace above and chill out. The staff are really friendly and helpful and the dogs and cats are nice to have around."
50,"A 35 peso taxi ride from Zicatela Beach, this funky, hip place has a great vibe with really nice people offering good service and excellent breakfasts. This is the best coffee in the area, and I'm a terrible coffee snob. We split an omelette and I'm glad we did since it was very generous. We also shared a fruit and yogurt dish that was also excellent. Definitely recommend this place for breakfast."
50,"If you are a surfer and wanna surf allot, this is the spot. You can find beutiful rooms 30s. from the beach. Nice restaurant with good food, drinks and service. In construction terace above restaurant will be awesome when finished and you could get a view like a champ...."
50,"I stayed here for a few days and loved the rustic hostel rooms. The prices were worth it, just with there was more lighting. The food at the resto was excellent with great quick service. I felt at home. The pool area is amazing as well. I had an unfortunate night when a group of drunk germans were being rowdy all night in the pool and wish someone told them to shut up because they kept me up all night since there isn't any barrier from noise at all. Thank god someone else screamed at them because I finally fell asleep. Great place!!"
50,"A lot of young people from around the world like this place, yet it is still quiet during the night, the price is alright and you can even work there to pay your stay I believe.  Mostly surfers visit this place, you won't get to see a lot of traditional local cousine but it is still a good place to be around.  Staff is made up of mostly young travelers but they are always willing to help "
50,"We were only in Puerto Escondido for 3 days but ate breakfast here everyday. Good portions, choice and healthy options. The juices are great and the vibe is very chilled. Would highly recommend if you're in the area."
40,"I really, really liked this place. The owners have done a great job of making this a cut above your average budget accommodation, with lots of quality finishing touches that i personally appreciated very much. I stayed in a small and unassuming cabaña, which had a very comfortable bed, mosquito net, and the most silent fan I have ever used that kept me cool without any noise disturbance whatsoever! The shared bathroom facilities are really a pleasure to use, and lots of details have been well thought out, such as hooks, shelves, lighting, and are kept scrupulously clean by the hardworking housekeepers. There is even a large plunge pool to use if the nearby beach is not appealing. Also very good wifi, which I have noticed is hard to come by in Mexico! The attached cafe/restaurant"
50,"Clean bathrooms and a comfy bed + a pool colder than the bathtub called „pacific ocean“. But the truly amazing thing about the hostel is its very welcoming atmosphere and it’s ability to connect people. I highly recommend the place for lone travelers and also to everyone who wants get in touch with others. Besides the heart the lovely owner gives to this plays, the volunteers really rock it. Lorena, Lea, Alex, Maria, Hugo ( I miss you man). Sadly I forgot a few names, but everyone of you shall feel hugged tightly!  I really didn’t get money for that review. I swear.  Thanks for the experience guys  Timo 😘"
10,"The place is very beautiful and clean. There are 2 rooftop places but as a guest you cant go there cause its for the volunteers only, same for the kitchen. They are rude, talk about you in Spanish (but we understand) and very arrogant. We left after one night because of this rudeness. We pay 600pesos for a tiny room and cant even make use of the nice facilities and have thefeeling they want you to leave. Go next door to el jugar!! Cheaper & super friendly people!"
50,I didn’t actually stay here but I did a day trip organised through Bonobo to see and swim with dolphins. It was truly amazing and I would highly recommend. Could also tell from being in the hostel for a matter of minutes that it has a great vibe and friendly staff.
50,"In all my one year of travels this is easily the best hostel I stayed in. You pretty much become part of the Bonobo family straight away. Super close to the beach and very social so easy to make friends. Spend a little extra money and book the bed on the terrace as you will have an amazing ocean view and bed. Alicia, Lara,Fernando, Ugo, Maria, Lea and Alex are all amazing people working at bonobo and will make you feel right at home and make it hard to leave. Thanks Bonobo  "
50,"Everything at bonobo is set up so you feel very at home all the staff and I mean all the staff are sooo friendly ! You have everything you need in walking distance amazing tacos, beach, atm, laundry and bars ! If you love to have fun bonobo is the place I could not say one bad thing about it! Its so good we are going back to stay for another week"
50,"Amazing staff, fun place to stay, pepes Tacos (the world's best tacos) are close by, walking distance to the beach, laundry close by, everything is great at booboo) bonobo. Free breakfasts are good as well. "
50,"I've been to many hostels around the world, some good, some bad and some that aren't memorable at all. Bonobo Surf House in Puerto Escondido was one that I would call AMAZING! From the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff, changing sheets, moping floors, cleaning the bathrooms, making delicious healthy breakfasts and offering fun events daily to the warm heartfelt hugs and sadness to see me go. I missed a flight due to an airline double booking and had to stay an additional night over Xmas/New Years when everything in town was fully booked... Bonobo found a way to keep me at their home and didn't charge me anything but fed my breakfast and sent me off to the airport the next day with hugs and hopes to see me again one day.   Thank you Alicia, Mister Bonobo and all the staff"
50,"Absolutely loved this hostel! such an awesome, friendly crew and good place to hang out! Super good location also. Could only stay a few nights as they became fully booked for the week I was there but was still welcomed there by the staff to hang out and get our daily iced coffee mezcals. Can’t wait to go back ❤️"
50,"One of the best hostels I stayed at within 5 month of traveling!  Dorm, bathroom and common area are always super clean, there is a nice pool and bar area and location is top. Bonobo offers nice (family) dinner and events, you can book tours and rent a scooter or book surf lessons 3 really nice beaches are in walking distance, two more just 10 min by taxi But best of all is the lovely team at Bonobo! 🥰 I’ll come back for sure!"
50,"Nice staff, clean and comfy rooms, good breakfast, delicious cocktails :) Possibility to attend in group activities, meet new people, go out and have fun. A good place to stay for more than a couple of days!"
50,"My wife and I have just had the most amazing stay with the Bonobo "" family "" where we enjoyed 4 nights / 5 days !! This hostel is full of positive energy and offers a great atmosphere and fun place to relax around the pool and bar. The staff are absolutely outstanding, always happy and smiling, wanting to talk with the guests and offer suggestions for the day. A HUGE shout out to all of them...Bonobo staff...Dani, Cecilia ,Lara, Heni, Alicia and Katia.  Breakfast is delicious and healthy each morning and they also have family dinners on certain nights which are excellent and great value for money. We stayed in a private room with ensuite and balcony which we thoroughly enjoyed. There are several awesome beaches within a 5-15 minutes walk from Bonobo. We walked to all of them,"
50,Perfect place to chillout. Is the 4th year in a row that i stay there. There is a jungle atmosphere quiet and peaceful just next to carrizalillo beach grat for surfing. Perfect for a solo trip or couples. Is clean and the staff very kindly. I highly recomend it. 
50,"Warm staff, clean and cozy accommodations, great location.  Clean facilities (kitchen can get a little messy, but it's a hostel), beautiful grounds, comfortable, quiet rooms, swimming pool, art everywhere... Beautiful place, it's own little world!  Hostal Shalom is located at the end of Benito Juarez Blvd, the main strip in Carrizalillo, which is in turn situated at the top of a crescent of cliffs that shelter Carrizalillo Beach. Clear, warm water rolls in over the many large igneous rocks that create a modest break, good for beginner or, sometimes, intermediate surfers. Food is a bit more expensive on the beach than up on the boulevard, but the colossal flights of stairs cutting a path down the cliff will make the slight premium on beer and grab worth it, rather than grabbing a"
50,"If you're coming to Puerto Escondido to be at the beach, relax and be around great people Shalom is the spot. It's right by the best and most beautiful swimming beach that's a little more calm and less touristy than the main beach. There are restaurants and shops near by, but it's not on the main strip so it's an ideal location to get all of the best. The accommodations are basic, but everything you need to enjoy Escondido to the max. It's paradise, so you don't need the Ritz.  This place seems to attract laid back happy people. Oh, and you can't beat the pool! Anywhere you'd want to go you can get there for about 30 pesos ($1.70 USD)."
50,"As a surfer, I spent 3 weeks in Shalom, I can just say: Perfect spot to be, when you want to enjoy the gentlle Carrizalillo waves. Just a 3min walk away from THE beginner-intermediate surf spot in the entire area Carrizalillo, the location is just amazing! And by the way, from the looks Carrizalillo is also just a dream come true.   After surfing you got the bar in the Hostal or the pool in the back under a bunch of palm trees to chill. Or you stroll down the Boulevard Benito Juarez to have a bite and pick one from a number of restaurants on the strip. The Boulevard is the place to be, if you have enough from the Zicatela Hype. Way more relaxed!  Go there and hang loose! It alters your mindset."
40,"This is a cheap hostel with swimming pool. It's huge for a hostel, but the installations are good preserved. The staff was very helpful, in addition the most of them are very friendly. Also is well-located, near to the beach Carrizalillo and in the end part of a boulevard with many interesting locals (food, beer, cafes, clothes...)."
50,"I go there every year at least once. It is cheap, very close to Carrizalillo, one of the best beaches in Oaxaca, it has a swimming pool that you can use no matter if you are camping, in a dorm, in a room or in a cabana. They have Wifi and they sell cheap beer. You can also use the kitchen if you wish. Great place to stay if you go on a trip with family and/or friends!"
50,"A cheap and very friendly place..it is very cheap and international..not everything is perfect, but that is, how life is....we had a great time there and we will come back, everytime we will visit puerto escondido..."
10,"By far the worst hostel traveled in all central South America Europe and China.  Water ran out in showers  Power shortages Kitchen advertised - fridge doesn't work, no soap for cleaning & covered in ants Prices doubled as to advertised price on arrival.  Vomit in all sinks in mornings  Toilets also covered in urine until around 930am No toilet paper in toilets  Showers filthy with hair and condoms for days  Open bar to public in the evenings until 4 am Stolen goods from dorms 16 bed dorm expanded to 22 and still charging double rates  Clothes taken by cleaners off common drying area and never returned  Over booked dorms were offered tents in 35 degree heat  Beer prices doubled depending on how many people were drinking but free of bar staff were sleeping with customer.  "
20,"We arrived with a recent price quote from the internet and when we spoke to the Seniora of this place she ruthlessly jacked our camping price from 40 pesos to 70 pesos per person. She seemed super irritated that we didn't speak Spanish and I found out from another camper who happened to speak Spanish and English that he was paying half the price we were. I'm sorry but how does this woman expect us to speak fluent Spanish on our first day (we actually came to Mexico to learn). And if this woman works in tourism, maybe she should learn English. Some other downers about the hostel: the kitchen is damp, dark and smelly, the lighting is horrible, the staff is outfitted with a bunch of teenagers who love to party until late and bathrooms and showers are a joke. Luckily, we found a"
20,"We stayed here for 3 nights, we booked online for a private room for a good cheap rate. When we arrived we were told we had to pay more as it was high season, I refused to pay the full price but still had to pay more than I wanted (I def would not stay there for full price). Rooms are small and hot, fan made so much noise it sounded like it would fall out if the roof. Our first night was next to the bar and they played ridiculously loud music till 6.30 am so we didn't get any sleep. We were able to move the following day to a better room. Toilets constantly block up and the kitchen is hopeless. On the website there was breakfast included, there was no breakfast. "
50,"Are you ready to discover what hosteling is all about? You can't pick a better place with a more intimate atmosphere. At first glance you might think that it is quite small, but after settling in you will not consider this as a flaw at all. Tyler and Angelina are perfect hosts and create a relaxed and friendly energy that immediately make you feel at home; a place to put your things down and unwind for awhile. The hostel rightly attracts people with a smile on their face and stories in their pockets. Add to that a great kitchen that you often do not get on the road and it all adds up to a great hang. Thanks guys, I really appreciated the welcome."
50,"Excellent hostel. If I ever come back to Puerto Escondido, which I hope I´ll do, I´ll definetely stay in this hostel again. The owners were great and really helpful. The hostel is located less than 50 mts far from the beach. Rooms are big and clean. There are excellent and very unexpensive restaurants in the surrondings. Everythin went perfectly good."
50,"My friend and I booked to stay just a few nights and ended up staying 3 weeks! This place is perfect. Tyler, Ange and Mauricio are such beautiful people and we are very grateful we found such a fun, happy and relaxed place to stay for our first time in Puerto Escondido.  Very knowledgeable about transport, tours and other destinations. The hostel is kept extremely clean, it's a close walk to the beach and there are plenty of shops and restaurants near by.  Definitely felt like a home away from home! We hope to return to Puerto Escondido and stay here another time."
50,"Pacific Buddha is the best hostel I've stayed in, end of chat. Angelina and Ty are amazing hosts looking after your every need whilst at the hostel - bests hosts ever? I'd say so.. Ty also seems to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the best places to shop for pretty much anything you want in Puerto Escondido whether it be fish, tacos, fish tacos, spanish lessons, restaurants - he's also a great sushi chef! The small size of the hostel means that there is a great collective vibe around the place with everybody hanging out together, we also organised an amazing sushi night with everyone getting the chance to make a roll and share it with the group (see the photos!). It's a real chilled out hostel close to shops where you can buy alcohol and some food and also a short colectivo"
30,"This is a lovely little hostel, it's in the perfect location. Right beside the beach with lovely little restaurants to walk to. The people are lovely and very helpful. Although there isn't much room here it's still a lovely find and would recommend it to anyone travelling and looking for a quite place to chill out.  "
50,"This place is definitely more than just a hostel. Tyler and Angelina are wonderful hosts who feel much more like friends or family while still making sure all your basic hostel accom needs are met.   In the best part of Puerto, La Punta (quiet and less touristy), a 2 minute walk from the stunning beach, the location is perfect with fruit and veg/beer shops close by and plenty of great places to eat, surf lessons, bars while still only being a short walk/collectivo along the beach to the main centre of Zicotela. The hostel has everything you need - clean kitchen and bathroom, wifi, communal water and coffee, super cheap but it's main draw is the super laid-back, family vibe, owing in part to it's nice smallish size (one dorm room and two private rooms) but mainly to the wonderful"
50,"Amazing atmosphere, rooms are spacious, clean, good WiFi, love the open kitchen and the indoor jungle. Owner is awesome, super friendly and fun to hang out with. Same for other guests. Also if you need some quiet time, chill out or read a bit, all possible. Near to the beach. 100% recommendable! "
50,"Pepe is so welcoming and helpful and clearly loves what he does and where he lives. I'll stay here again right away next time I come to Puerto which, I have no doubt, will be before long. His place is how every hostel should be - garden, good facilities, hammocks, outdoor kitchen, new friends and above all a truly excellent host! Saludos, Pepito!"
50,"In Pepes unbelievably beautiful garden between mango trees and bougainvilleas there's no way not to chill peacefully in a hammock. The rooms of his Casa Kei are each one unique and with a different kind of appeal - everywhere one feels that they are built with a lot of love. A peaceful place with a good, calm vibe and a discrete, respectful and caring host that will reliably help you with anything you need. My personal favorite and recommendation for people who ask for atmosphere but no more than a bed, palmroof, seabreeze and oceanview: The sunset room. I returned already many times to Casa Kei and couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in Puerto/La Punta … already looking forward to come back soon."
50,I had a great time at  this premises it is home away from home beautiful room with the most gorgeous wood decorations it feels like a cabin with s very comfortable mistress the host makes you feel at home great coffee like something I never tasted before beautiful vegetation surrounds everything I highly recommend itm
50,"Casa Kei is a wonderful guesthouse. Pepe is a great host and I felt welcome and at home right away! The garden is amazing and invites you to spend the whole afternoon in a hammock in the shade. I met so many nice travelers and people from all over the world and enjoyed every minute. I highly recommend this place, thank you so much for the good times I have to come again one day!!"
50,"Its an amazing place, beautiful located, 5 minute walk to the surfing area of Puerto, La Punta. Pepe is great. Accommodations are really nice, some with incredible views to the Ocean. Amazing place to disconnect from routine and just CHILL."
50, マンゴーの木の下、庭のハンモックでのんびり、メキシコの休日を楽しみました。サーフィンに詳しいオーナーのぺぺさん、とっても楽しく親切です！絶対また行きます! Wonderful place for relaxing! Beautiful garden with organic fruits and owner Pepe is so nice. spent fabulous Mexican holidays! must go again!
50,"Pepes house is situated a short walk to la punta beach which is less busy than zicatela and better for swimming, it also has great waves for all types of surfer. Pepe was so helpful and happy to give you information on places to go and best ways of getting there.  From casa kei it's very easy to get a collectivo which takes you to the town centre. They come very frequently and very cheap.  The house is surrounded by beautiful gardens which provided some much needed shade to escape the heat.  The kitchen has everything you need to whip up any meal.  The rooms are great and breezy with fantastic views. Would definitely recommended this place. I stayed for over 2 weeks and enjoyed every minute. It's close to all possible locations you would want to visit. "
50,"Escape the 'rush' of Puerto Escondido and stay at the beautiful Casa Kei. The place is about 5 minutes walk from a swim-friendly beach called La Punta, which also has plenty of places to eat/drink and watch all the well sculpted surfers wander by. Pepe made me feel so welcome and even showed me around the beaches on his scooter, pointing out the best places to explore. As a solo traveller, I met amazing people through Casa Kei and I think the atmosphere Pepe creates with his beautiful fruit garden , private cabanas and local/Mexican knowledge makes any time spent in Puerto an unforgettable time. Fresh mangoes fall straight onto your place at Casa Kei and these made up the bulk of my diet. I was intending on staying 5 days but my experience was so rich that I ended up staying for"
50,"Casa Kei is a beautiful guest house on La Punta, the further end of the Puerto Escondido. La Punta is much more relaxing and nice to stay on, great restaurants nearby! Close to the beach, yoga, fresh fruit & vegetable stand (mangos & avocados!!), restaurants, convenience type store, liquor store.   Great environment, hammocks to lounge in, a nice cooking area with plenty of cooking supplies, just need the food!  Highly recommend this place, I was there for almost 2 weeks and loved it."
50,"We spent 5 days at Gecko Rock. It is, by far, the best resort vacation I have had. The amazing 5 star food, private setting, rooftop hammock, secluded beach, wonderful hosts are just part of it. We were escorted to great shopping, great local restaurants, and a local coffee house with amazing coffee that we just have to go back for more. Walking to nearby beach restaurants with local charm capped it off.   I have been to many resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean. This one is tops.  I cannot say enough about how perfect this was for us. Relaxing on the beach for hours and coming back to a pool to cool off then a catered dinner and drinks.   We are going back and bringing friends. Definitely."
50,"We had a wonderful time during our stay at Gecko Rock. The hotel is truly the definition of paradise. You can take long walks on the beach without running into a single person. The pool was just a few steps outside our door, and the palapa lounge was great for reading or playing board games during the hottest part of the afternoon. But the real highlight of our trip was the food. I have several dietary restrictions, and Aileen was able to accommodate all of them while still delivering delicious meals every single day. We were blown away with our dinners each night. We also enjoyed a rooftop pitcher of Jamaica Margarita nearly every evening. We enjoyed chatting with Mike and getting to learn about his travels and experiences running the hotel. Mike was also very prompt and took"
50,"Top Ten reasons to stay at Gecko.  1) You will be on a first name basis with the owners and experience amazing service.  2) It’s small - maxes out at 8 people 3) Amazing food, with a fusion of Asian & Mexican cuisine 4) Waterfall showers with river-rock floors 5) A secluded slice of beach, you might see five people all day  6) A handful of  local beachfront cafes on the sand within a 20minute walk down the beach 7) A Pacific beach that faces south so you can catch both sunrise and sunset on the water. 8) Being able to turn off the room A/C and listen to the crashing waves 9) Comfy world-class beds and sheets. 10) Your own roof-top oasis to swing in a hammock or stargaze at night.    Top Five Reasons to NOT stay at Gecko. 1) You’d rather experience a large resort with more"
50,"We recently returned from Gecko Rock Resort after I had been looking at photos and dreaming of going there for about 2 years.  My husband finally said ""pick a date and book it"" and we can honestly say we feel so refreshed that we can't wait to return.  The food is amazing and the pool and the beach are gorgeous.  I am not a person who typically likes to relax  (I love to travel to big cities and wander and go to museums) but this place will take your breath away and you won't have a care in the world.  Our bungalow was both comfortable and spotless and we could hear the crashing waves of the ocean while we slept.  I can't say enough about Gecko Rock Resort as it's the most relaxing vacation I have ever had."
50,"There is much for me to say about Gecko Rock and I always fail to say it all.  This is our fourth stay.  We will be back again.  The resort is beautiful and improves with each stay.  They maintain the resort each year and it shows.  The food is always amazing and eating while listening to the roar of the ocean is always relaxing.   If you want a place to relax, read a book and really connect with your partner this is the place to do it.   I will never be able to thank Aileen and Mike enough for creating this place."
50,"This was the best vacation ever!  The resort was amazing and had the best time.  The whole resort was very clean and everything was up to date.  Mike, the owner, was very accommodating and helpful from the very beginning, when I inquired about availability.  All the meals were outstanding!  The private beach is stunning!  This was the most relaxing vacation and a great place to unwind.  Everything was fantastic and we cannot wait to go back!"
50,"Our week-long stay at Gecko Rock was a year in the planning as four adult couples were flying in from different locations. Mike was a pleasure to work with in reserving dates for our stay and arranging roundtrip ground transportation for each of our flights. Gecko Rock is a bit off the beaten path and was perfect for us all to reconnect, relax, and have all food and drink provided. The grounds are lush and well maintained and the common area and rooms are clean and comfortable. One can escape to the rooftop at night to view the stars. We enjoyed walks along the ocean, which is accessible in just minutes via a  private path. There are books and games available on site, including a court for Kubb or bocce. The pool was often our center of activity; lounging on a float, playing"
50,"A stunning private resort, located just a minute walk from the beach is an ideal place to go and relax from everyday hustle and bustle. The tranquillity of place and authentic experience of rural Mexico, from people, food & setting (sounds of ocean waves, iguanas & geckos that live at resort as well as birds) that we were able to indulge on this trip truly blew us away.   We visited Gecko Rock Resort as party of 8 and Mike & Eileen’s who are the most attentive hard working hosts delivered a personalised service to us all. Nothing was too much trouble and they were perfect hosts.   And the “FOOD GLORIOUS FOOD”… OMG our taste buds were in for a feast every day. Each day there was a new tasty surprise on our plates but I don’t want to spoil your surprise by telling you what we ate."
50,"I haven't even been back home a full week but I already miss this place. Everything from the palapa (outdoor dining room/rec room) to the pool and the accomodations were beautifully decorated and kept meticulously clean. The landscaping is gorgeous. The beach is less than two minutes away, so the sound of waves crashing all day long sets the tone of tranquility. By far my favorite place to post up was on the roof of the casitas. You get a view of the property, surrounding land, and the ocean. We spent every sunset there and several late nights enjoying the stars. There are various opportunities for daily excursions and adventures, but the pool is also a perfect spot for some down time. I can't remember the last time I ever felt so relaxed and at peace. It is the ideal setup for"
50,"I wanted to return to Gecko Rock after my first solo visit, so my GF and I headed on down for the Thanksgiving week. We also stayed in Mexico City on either 'side' of our week at Gecko Rock which we HIGHLY recommend. Mexico City is fantastic, but back to Gecko Rock...  Since I visited last, a cool roof lounge area has been added on top of each building. The lounge area is a great way to relax with an awesome view of the sunset in the evening. Do take advantage of the sundowner drink specials... they are yummy and they get delivered to you on the roof! Go Mike! At night, the roof decks make a great place for stargazing.  The food was fantastic as always. We liked the lighter, boxed lunch options. No more FOMO if you are away from the resort during lunch time. The Passion Fruit"
50,"Had been there last summer. There is excellent place to stay in Puerto Escondido. Cosy house with everything You need for comfort living. Big kitchen, clean showers, nice rooms and etc. Just feel like in your own house.  The district is very calm, There are some nice cafes and restaurantes pretty close. And beautiful bay Carrizalillo in 5 minutes walking.  Definitely recommend this place!"
40,"First of all, let me say that I did not stay here when it was a hotel, I stayed here with the family who runs it now when it was their home. So I can't really comment on the current quality, but I am leaving this review as a favor to them in hopes that their new enterprise goes well. I stayed there earlier than 2012, but TripAdvisor wouldn't let me select anything earlier than that.   The Ibarras are so nice, they treated me and the other student rooming with me like a member of their own family. They speak English extremely well. It's a short walk to the Carrizilillo beach entrance. (You do have to walk down a long flight of stairs from there). There's also a cafe nearby and it's a short walk to the taxi service."
50,"This amazing family-owned casa is definitely one of the favourite places we stayed during our trip. Clean rooms, which are in really good shape. The absolutely BEST outdoor kitchen ever. We cooked there every day, chilled at the hammocks and played games with other guests. Well supplied kitchen and PURE DRINKING WATER !! :) The beach and cafes, laundry, and what not are couple blocks away. The center is a cab ride away, however easy to go. Carrizalillo (the nearby beach) has surf schools and the hosts can recommend the best ones. This is also the beach where you can actually SWIM. In the ""center"", where all the clubs and hotels are, it might not be possible because the waves are so big that you must be pro surfer to go into the water.."
50,"The affordable accommodations offered at Casa Azul Puerto are, by virtually any metric, top-notch.  Nestled in the safe quiet colonia Bacocho, you are within a short stroll to an international variety of small, informal cafes and restaurants - most with sidewalk tables.      Picturesque coves nearby offer safe swims without the treacherous full-blown ocean currents of Zicatela.  Bicycle rentals are abundant in the area and a great way to enjoy the residential streets.      The well-designed and family managed rooms are new and clean.  As a long-time traveller on the Granola Head Trail, it just doesn't get any better than the stainless steel communal kitchen.  The market is only a few blocks away.  Experiment with the local fruits and vegetables -  and, of course, there's lots of"
50,"I spent 3 weeks at Casa Azul and enjoyed it a lot!   1. It is perfectly located:  - 5 min. walk to Carrizalillo beach, bars, supermarket, laundry service, restaurants, surf school  - located in nice, calm and clean neighbourhood  - close enough to, but also far enough from Zicatela beach (easy to go there to have some drinks and to go to the clubs, but far enough for not being bothered by noise and tourists) - 15 min. walk or 3 min. ride to the main bus station (OCC, ADO)  2. It is clean, well-equipped and has a great atmosphere - great outside kitchen (fridge, gas stove, pans etc., drinking water provided) - chill-out area with hammocks - nice rooms - the cutest dogs on earth (homie and chabby)! - safe: you get your one keys for the house+garden (and of course for your room) -"
50,"I've been already two times at Casa Azul and would go back again I love the relaxed atmosphere at this place. I do surf, so it's important to me to be close to the beach and have a safe place to store my board. It takes like  5 minutes to the next beach, which is called ""Carizallio"". In summer it's a good beach for beginners (but there were days, when it's too big for me).  Altough dining out in Puerto is quite econmic, I appreciate the fact to have a kitchen, so that I can make myself breakfast or a snack.   I've been there with some friends, so we used the terrace somehow as our meeting point to chill or having some drinks before going out. With the taxi it's just 10 minutes to Zicatela - the taxi prices are good aswell, we just paid 2 euros to get to Zicatela!  All in all I"
40,"My young son and I stayed at this property for a week recently.  First for the overwhelming positives:   - this is exactly what you would picture a cool, laid back, pretty and comfy surfing and beachy surf school and property to look like.  Verdant and lush gardens, hammocks, wood and stone, a tidy communal outdoor kitchen, and chill out spaces. - very responsive and on’-the-ball staff (within working hours of course), quick on WhatsApp to schedule, reschedule, resolve issues, etc. - great quality instructing (both yoga and surfing), good with kids and adults alike - good location* as you’re only two blocks from beach and one block from all the nightlife and restaurants (plus a few mini-marts).  Laundry, pharmacy, good coffee shops, etc. also very short walking distance - cool"
50,"Puerto Surf House is the perfect place to stay and learn surfing! The staff is amazing, kind and helpful, providing good tips about life in Puerto. The surf instructors are really good, they love and know what they’re doing. They’ll definitely help you to improve your surfing skills while having a lot of fun!  Staying at Puerto Surf makes you feel at home with your family! I’ll for sure be back! 🤙🏼💛"
50,"We are super happy about our stay at Puerto Surf House.  The staff was so kind and helpful and the service was excellent. They helped us book tours, gave us tips on resturant’s and on what to do. We were treated as family during the stay. We also took surf classes and the teachers was super professional and kind."
50,"Thank you to all the wonderful staff at puerto surf house for making my stay so delightful. Gréât location, gréât service, warm welcome, convivial atmosphere, inspiring people and best surf teachers !!!!"
50,"I only have positive comments about my experience at Puerto Surf. The house is beautiful and is located in a great spot just a few steps from the beach. It's staff -from David, the owner, to the girls in the front desk and the instructors- is extremely friendly. They did everything in their hands to accommodate my stay.  I took the surf+yoga package and it was just perfect: surf and yoga lessons were great (all of the instructors were patient and very helpful). I particularly loved practicing yoga with Alice. Also, the breakfast options were delicious.   I'm already planning my next stay with them."
50,"This was my first time in Puerto Escondido.  Could not have picked a better place to stay. The “hangout” package was a really great deal. The included massage, breakfast and photos exceeded my expectations.    10/10 would love to go back!"
40,"The staff at Puerto Surf is amazing. They are so friendly and helpful and the surf instructor I had was truly wonderful. I only marked them down from five to four stars because of cleanliness. There seemed to be blood on the wall in the bathroom which hadn’t been scrubbed off and there were dirty, muddy prints all over the wall next to the bed.   Not related to the number of stars given, just want to make mention for those picky people out there; their Wi-Fi is NOT good enough to use for work should you find yourself needing to work while traveling. "
50,"I had a magic room (no. 6) with private terrace and a beautiful view right to the surf spot La Punta. The location is perfect. It is quiet, but near to the restaurants, shops and bars. The garden is a bit of a paradise☺️ The crew is very helpful, the surf instructors are also kind and really take a good care of you. You can’t find a better place in Puerto Escondido."
50,"I stayed two weeks at Puerto Surf, the first solo and a friend joined me for the second week.  I booked the package surf & stay, which means I had 5 semi private surf classes per week :) the team is super flexible and spontaneous so that you can create your personalized package!  The surf classes were definitely the highlight of my stay and I can highly recommend to take classes with the instructors from Puerto Surf! I felt super comfortable with all of them and had a lot of fun. Thanks a lot to see the team and I will see you hopefully soon."
50,"Puerto surf is super welcoming and will make you feel at home very quickly. The surf lessons are great and waves can always be found from a number of beaches nearby for all levels. Yoga available too. Thanks so much Ani, Luis, Chucho for a great time in la punta :)  Shiv"
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed at La Barca Surf House for 2 1/2 weeks, and we loved it! We are pretty low-maintenance so we weren't expecting much, but we were pretty blown away when we arrived. It's a beautiful property (recently built) with a pool and an awesome common kitchen/hangout area under a gazeebo. We stayed in El Faro, which has it's own balcony overlooking the pool with a kitchen, a comfortable bed, and a private bathroom (which is very nice). It was cleaned 3 times a week, which was great and also had fast and reliable WIFI. Only a few minute walk from the Oasis Surf/Spanish School and our favorite beach/surf spot, Carrizalillo. We were taking surf and Spanish lessons, along with several other tenants, so it was a lot of fun to see them at Oasis and get to know them. You"
50,"I stayed at La Barca Surf House for a month and was incredibly impressed with my experience there. The apartments are absolutely perfect for surf students or  people on vacation in Puerto Escondido. The apartments and facilities are extremely clean and tastefully decorated. I stayed in two of the apartments, El Faro and Virazon and both have a full kitchen, balcony, bathroom with beautiful shower, drinking water included and ceiling fans to keep you cool. The apartments are bright and cheery and come with cleaning service every 3 days. The facilities include a pool and a large, communal kitchen as well. The owners, Sol and Roger, live on the premises and are always available for anything you need. Sol is the quintessential hostess, an absolutely lovely individual who will make"
50,"My husband and our 2 children age 7 and 11 stayed for 12 days in the La Barca Surf House Apartamentos (owned by Oasis Surf Academy) and took surfing and Spanish lessons.  We stayed in a little apartment with a small private outdoor kitchenette area. Our rooms were perfect for us - simple yet new, modern and comfortable. We loved the fact that there is no A/C and that the ceiling fans were all we needed. There is a larger apartment available for families who like private indoor space with a full kitchen. There are good room options for couples as well. We really enjoyed the outdoor communal kitchen and dining area where we were able to meet travelers from around the world who were also taking surfing and Spanish lessons with Oasis. The children loved the little pool essential for"
50,"After booking in to a hotel in town for my first few nights where I got ripped off and had absolutely no vibe, it was a blessing to find Sunset Point. I wanted a place where I could relax solo when I wanted and hang out with new friends when I wanted which was the perfect balance Sunset Point provided. Surfed every morning at Zicatela until the winds turned (short walk to the main road then cheap collectivo ride to the Zicatela or a 10 min walk to La Punta for mellower waves), then back to cook my breakfast in the great kitchen followed by a nap in my hammock then hanging out with the hotel owner and his loyal returning guests for the rest of the day before heading down to the beach for a sunset swim and a few beers. La Punta is so much nicer and more chilled than the main town."
50,"The rooms/grounds  During our months stay at Sunset Point we stayed in two rooms. For the first few weeks Al and the guys had kindly given us the bungalow. It was huge! We had a large living space and open kitchen, with a massive bathroom. Having a kitchen is great, we cooked nearly every day and we had all the appliances/utensils you could want and more! We then moved into one of the surf apartments which was a block of 4 rooms next to the pool. We had a hob, sink and tables and chairs outside the room which meant that we could continue cooking for ourselves.We loved staying in the apartment, they are really social and all built around the pool. It’s a sweet set up. The rooms are very comfortable and extremely clean and tidy, we couldn’t of asked for more!  The swimming pool is"
10,"We booked 3 month before arrival and also prepaid a part of the rent. After a long journey from Europe we finaly arrived at sunset point, but were told, that the rooms are rented out and we have to search another place ! Not even a drink was offered - the owner just wanted us to get away ! Very unfriendly, very unpofessional, very rude. I can't believe the possitive comments above and I would never recommend this place ! Absolutely disappointing.  There are much nicer places around Puerto with friendly and honestely people."
50,"I started my three month journey through Central America at Sunset with the intention of staying two weeks, but had to force myself to leave after 5.   Chris is the optimum host. He is relaxed, laid back and approachable. Nothing is a problem and the layout is such that you can be as social or private as you like. You have your own space as well as a more than substantial common area with darts!   I loved this place, and any trip I make in the future will have this as a starting point.   As a solo traveler it was perfect, and I feel that I made some lifelong friends.   Every day I think about the restaurants down at La Punta, the food from the markets and the darts that we played.   I loved it."
40,"I stayed here two entire months! And while not a ""resort"" per se Chris goes out of his way to accomodate. A great guy and I'll be back next year! Out of town just far enough to be quiet with commoradie that will build lifetime friendships Good people and good times can't be purchased. Was here at same time as the ""Blatchfords"" and as they stated its a nice place. Execellent value for money. And great people. I have traveled to many countries and stayed in numerous places of all different styles, but sunset point is a place unmatched for gorgeous views and relaxing....period!"
50,"Friendliest people I have ever met, best hammocks, very communal. Huge pool and stunning vistas, cannot beat the sunsets here. The owner is one of the best people I have met and I hope to return one day soon!"
20,"Although I agree with the below comments about Chris and Rosella being great, (and their daughter being a sweetheart) I cannot disagree more with many of the reviews here. The common kitchen area is filthy. The pool has moss on the walls (slimy) and the water is murky. One of our family members got lice there. They let their dogs run all over the ""resort"" and we stepped in dog poop on several different occasions. (and were woken by the nightly barking) No air conditioning which was essential!!  We are easygoing travellers who have stayed in many places and are not usually picky but these comments make the place sound like a resort when in reality, it is not. It definitely is a good ""bang for your buck"" but seeing as puerto escondido is not easy to get to and how affordable"
50,"Absolutely one of the highlights of our Mexico trip. We travelled for 3 weeks through Mexico and saw a lot of places. Sunset Point was definitely one of the hidden gems we were looking for, just amazing. We stayed in a Surf Apartment, which is basic but does the job perfectly (Who wants to stay in a room anyways when you are in paradise?). The rooms were clean and the bathroom is nicely designed. The basic surf apartments do not have A/C, which could be a problem for some during nighttime since it can get quite warm. But the upper apartments, which are bigger in size as well, do have A/C and an amazing view over Puerto Escondido and the beach.  The resort is beautiful. Starting with the open kitchen/community area with large TV, big fridge and everything else you need. The pool"
50,"Really laid back place with a great owner who opens his hotel to being yours ...... The views are amazing and it's only a 5 minute walk down the dirt road  to la punta for a surf or the restaurants which are cheap and great food . A taxi from Zigatela in town is only 50 pesos and being away from the crowds is fantastic when you have a cold beer in your hand at sunset ..... Will definitely stay here again ASAP ....cheers Todd blinky ,teeny  jake and Bonnie"
50,"Sunset Point is a gem!     I went there to meet up with a life long friend who I seem to meet in different countries doing different extreme sports and swapping life's pearls of wisdom. This was a perfect place to meet... there is a crazy music connection and somehow a huge connection with a certain ski resort in Austria... I guess that when you are not surfing you should be skiing... or something fun.. Such an amazing welcome.. Chris made a delicious BBQ, Fillet Mignon, perfectly medium rare....     Just a few minutes walk to the surfing beach or you can jump in the back of the jeep if your timing is right...     Pick your breakfast papaya from the tree just outside your apartment, if you are willing to climb  that tree like a monkey...  And why not? You are on holiday, after"
20,"Why in a nice place , the restaurant is so terrible!  They make us 2 horrible sandwiches ( hope to feel good tonight ) with frozen fish fillet still like a stone and another one with no taste e frozen beef! Why do you do this? Good bye and good luck. A lot . You need. "
50,"This hotel / hostel is right across the street from Zicatela beach.  I was given a second floor room facing the ocean.  I had a small balcony where I could sit and watch the ocean.  The property is clean, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Joe at the front desk speaks excellent English.  The pool in the back was cool and refreshing.  I bought some charcoal at the store next door and used the community BBQ grill.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an inexpensive place to stay without all the frills.  I was very happy with my choice."
50,"I originally passed this place over due to all the party photos, but I'm glad I walked by and asked if they had rooms with a view (lady next door said they did). One-hundred and sixteen steps (yup, counted) later I had the best view in town and a hammock - which was exactly what I was looking for. The room was clean, and the staff was super friendly and helpful. Very nice people. The place gets loud at night down below...but up at the top all you hear is the ocean. Would definitely stay again. "
50,"Ive traveled all over and this hostel/hotel is amazing.  Has everything you want,  great location, good price, good food, kitchen (2 actually), a good pool, a bar, great staff and I can't say it enough great location.  10 second walk to beach. Im going back asap!"
10,We had a few decent days in the Hostel. The Restaurant is quite nice with good value. Also the pool is very good.   Unfortunately one guy of the staff waited for our snorkeling trip on 6:00 am to enter our room and steal money from our luggage. He used the second key for our room which we didn´t receive on our check-in. The other employees couldn´t / wouldn´t help. Very very disappointed experience. This is why i strongly recommend not visiting this Hostel!
40,"We initially thought we'd stay one night - just for a more ""beachy"" experience in Puerto Escondido; but had so much fun and were so comfortable - we stayed a week!  The hostel is basic, with a unique kind of screen room semi-private option which we chose as it meant we could leave our things out each day and just lock the screen door to our room.  The small but refreshing pool is fabulous in the back; the proximity to the beach - as in - across the street - is perfect; but most of all it was the people!  Great management, great group of young travelers and just a really good feel about the place.  Oh - and the restaurant attached - Auakate - has THE BEST BURGERS I've ever had!  2 for 1 on Fridays!"
50,"stayed at pakololo for around a month. This is one of the funnest hostels i have stayed in with the best people. the restaurant food is amazing, breakfast are easy enough for two. the location is the best, right on the beach front. The staff here really make it a great place Jules is the biggest legend ever, and so helpful, there is always something new being build to improve and the grounds are always clean. great prices and range of rooms. Love this place!"
40,"I stayed there when I was in puerto escondido for about 3-4 nights. it's right infront of the surf beach, playa zicatela. good location with good price. great staff and owner. Lauro was a nice guy who opened the hostel. definitely recommend to stay here if you're going to playa zicatela."
50,"Had an awesome time in the main dorm, pool keeps you cool and entertained during the day and the staff are very accomodating especially julia, great spot to party with a deck from the dorm overlooking the strip and Zicatella beach. Refered by so many people, most of whom probably dont do reviews so dont overlook this spot."
50,"I hear they have a pool now. I was apart of the pre pool pakololo family and I can only imagine it's an even better place now! The staff was awesome, friendly, and helpful. Easy access to the life on Zicatela, there's a tienda with beer next door, and there's often a man with wheelbarrow ice cream out front."
50,"We absolutely loved our time at Akumal!! Eric and Aide are great hosts and the hostel has one of the most relaxed and welcoming atmospheres I've ever experienced anywhere. This place attracts really interesting, friendly people and we sure made a whole heap of great friends during our time here.  The hostel is in a great, quiet location a short walk from the beach and cafes/shops of La Punta. It has a great layout, a fully equipped kitchen w/ gas stove and oven, and cool art everywhere. Could stay here for a very long time!"
50,"I stayed at akumal for 4 nights, i was only meant to stay for 3 but loved it so much i squeezed in an extra night. The owners are beautiful people, and as soon as you walk in greet you with big smiles and feels like you are seeing old friends. They unfortunately left the day after i arrive to go on a little holiday. They left the hostel to their friends who were equally amazing. The hostel had a great bunch of people, we would all cook together in the communal kitchen and hang out at night. It was a great space, with good music and attitudes. <3"
50,"One of the best hostels I`ve ever visited! The owner Erick is super nice and chilled out, makes you feel so comfortable and so safe. We were only supposed to stay a couple of nights and ended up there for a few weeks. If I had more time, Id still be there! The place is decorated beautifully, a great vibe, 30 seconds away from the beach, an awesome kitchen, hammocks and heaps of areas to chill out including the roof which is amazing at night.  Erick made us a killer BBQ one night, let us throw parties, he keeps it super clean all the time, you can hire a bike, snorkel, and he'll give you the best tips of where to go, where not to go, activities and where to eat/drink. He can help you with other areas of Mexico as well, he is super smart and knows lots of sweet tips so just ask!"
50,"very nice design of the hostel & very kind owner. the hostel is in a nice place with amazing restaurants in the neighborhood, very near to the  beach and not far from the bus station.   it's also a very cute story about the name of the hostel:  akumal is a beautiful place in mexico where the turtles goes for the rest. so the backpack-tourists are the turtles ☺️"
50,"One of the best hostels you will venture in to. Right next to the beach and with such a friendly vibe it's hard not to love this place. We came to stay for 4 days and ended up staying for two weeks! Good beaches, good people, good vibes. Amazing!!!"
40,"Erik and his girlfriend are so chilled out and so friendly. We payed $10US a night each for a private room and for the price, it was awesome. However, Puerto gets so hot and because you're in a concrete building with nothing but a small standing fan- it is so so hot!! We had to change hostels because we couldn't sleep as we were so hot, but if this isn't an issue for you- then definitely stay here! Short walk to La Punta and 30pesos taxi to Puerto main town."
50,"Stayed here almost a week, and I really enjoyed it! It's located in the calm area of ""la punta"" which i really preferred over more busy and tourist-heavy Zicatela beach (which also is easily accesible from this hostel by taxi, colectivo or a nice walk along the beach). The service at the hostel is very good, and the people working there will help you with whatever you need. Nice little dorm, and a kitchen to make food, so you don't have to so spend money on restaurants all the time. You van either relax in the hammocks, in the living room (Where Manuela always plays great music), or on the rooftop, Where there also is yoga classes in the mornings. Absolutely on of the best hostels I stayed at in Latin America, and if you get the chance, check out the equally enjoyable"
50,"I stayed 2 weeks at akumal and had a great time. The atmosphere is superb and Eric and Manu are super friendly, helpful and social. The beach is only a stones throw away as well as heaps of places to eat and party. The accom is cheap and the free breakfast goes down a treat. Cheers for the stay guys. Brandon the 3rd"
50,"I stayed at Hostal Akumal Puerto Escondido in August, sorry for the late review.  Even though they were just preparing to open, they welcomed me and made me very comfortable.  The hostal is a gem, with beautiful spaces to hang out and Eric and friends giving extraordinary service and the beach just a few steps away.  In all ways a delight!  I can hardly wait to go back!"
50,"I drove by one day to stay for a night ended up staying for 2 months Erick(the owner) and el senor lewis are 100% guys  and will make you feel at home. The kitchen and rooms are great and erick knows everything about mexico where to go , when to go, where to stay, and make a killer ceviche."
20,"If you don't like mosqitos, go elsewhere. Screens don't seal. Rooms swarming."
40,"we and another couple spent three nights at Hotel Santa Fe.  The staff is warm and helpful.  The Hotel is from another era but still has its charm.  The vegetarian restauant in the hotel has a great view and good meals.  The Hotel has great walking on the beach and the strip of small shops (no shopping) and restaurants. Some good little restaurants within walking distance.  There is a busy road between the Hotel and the beach. Not that busy and not too bad but it is there. PE is a surfer spot and so you don't see quite as many old gringo tourists.  We all liked walking the beach and the strip from the Hotel.  I also recommend the town and market in PE.  It's truly Mexican.   Also, do walk down the 169 stone stairs to the beach to the north about 2 miles. The name escapes me but"
50,I was there traveling for business and loved this place.  One example of how they take care of you.....  The wireless internet was not working.  I was very bummed as I needed it for my work.  The next morning I noticed a cat5 cable on my balcony!  I had great internet for all fo my stay!  They had to hang the cord in the trees to get it to me but they did it without asking.   Clean rooms perfect location!
40,"I can hardly describe in words the beautiful stay I recently had at the Hotel Santa Fe.  The staff was friendly and helpful,  the food was delectable,  and the rooms where quite, comfortable,  and spacious.   Two pools where nestled in various courtyards amongst the meandering pathways of the hotel.  Iguanas lay in the sun while palm trees allow for plenty of pool side shade,  as the sound of ocean waves carry your worries away.  The surrounding town and beaches are welcome and friendly,  with plenty to see and do.  And if nothing is what you aspire to do,  Puerto Escondido is the perfect place to accomplish that as well. I will defiantly be going back to the Hotel Santa Fe as soon as I can make it down south again.  Highly recommended."
50,"I am now semi retired, but during my more active working days I traveled all over the world and stayed in some of the very best hotels. The Hotel Santa Fe does not have the ""glass and the brass"" as a friend of mine would say, but it does have an atmosphere that cannot be beat nor duplicated. From the time you check in with the receptionist manager Monica, you are welcomed as part of the family. The staff are very warm and friendly and the hotel itself is absolutely beautiful with its colonial style architecture, tropical landscaping, and multiple level pools. All this and right across the street from playa zicatela (one of the best surfing beaches in the world) and playa marinero and centro (very safe swimming beaches). The open air restaurant facing the ocean is fabulous with a"
50,"We have stayed in this hotel and others throughout mexico for many years.  Outside of the classic resort, tourist destination with gold faucets, this hotel is a perfect example of classic mexican development in a fascinating and very genuine small city.  The staff has always been top notch, yet not subservient to Classic tourist demands.  Respect when shown both ways is a high light in developing a true Anglo/Mexicano relationship.  Rooms, albeit without flat screen tv are unique in design within the entire setting, and offer neat, clean amenities. Bathrooms with talavera tiles are what some traveler visit other spots of mexico to see.  Yes, even the bathrooms.  Food in the restaurant, once one acknowledges the staff with respect get the job done with a smile and a genuine"
50,Hotel Santa Fe is my favorite hotel in the world. It is like home away from home. The grounds are gorgeous with 3 separate pools and the retaurant is fantastic. The front desk personel are charming.
10,"They need to update the pictures that we see when we make reservations. Hotel is very duty, old & stincky. All rooms smell like meldew. Bed are as hard as a rock. You find hairs on bed & bathroom. The hotel need a total remodeling so it looks like the pictures in the internet."
50,"Whenever I need a quiet, relaxing vacation I head to Hotel Santa Fe in Puerto Escondido, Mexico.  There are plenty of things to see and do and I've experienced only a fraction of them; such as awesome bird watching, visiting nearby beaches, shopping, touring the hotel's coffee plantation (just to name a few). Hotel Santa Fe has a footprint much like that of a gothic spanish town but in a rustic mexican style.  It's fun to explore all of the nooks and cranny's of it's meandering architecture.  Within the beautifully landscaped grounds are three swimming pools, a cordial staff and an extraordinary restaurant which has views of the beach and tumultuous surf.  The food at the restaurant is nicely presented (on El Palomar stoneware and traditional mouth-blown glassware), healthy,"
40,"We arrived from Oaxaca without a reservation, but had seen the night before that the Hotel Santa Fe had rooms available.  They offered us a room at the same rate as on line.  The room was nice, no view, but roomy.  It had been cleaned after the last guests, but should have been refreshed for new ones.   The restaurant was lovely and the pools were nice, but again could have been cleaned better.  The location was hard to beat and they were happy to continually provide us with clean beach towels and allowed us to check out late. The hotel was almost empty as it was off season.  It is a resort style hotel with the beauty of of Zicatela Beach right outside your door. Other beaches and the shopping area and main street are also just a short walk away. We enjoyed our stay and it gave"
50,"This (casa de las angeles boutique ) check out their website. It is a modern 6 suite complex. A garden with gym equipment to enjoy along with an exercise spa pool.  One bedroom suite with TV & Air Con.A balcony overlooking the garden, large enough to have a candle-light dinner or breakfast in the morning, you can even suntan anytime of the day.

50,"We like to have more than just a hotel room so this fit the bill perfectly.  A comfortable bedroom with a nice terrace, spacious bathroom plus a fully equipped kitchen, all spick and span. The hosts are extremely kind and go out of their way to be of assistance.  There's a lovely palapa with great views where you can relax (gaze at the stars), socialize and meet the other guests. It's secure and eco-friendly. Great location, a short walk to the beach (Playa Carrizalillo) and nearby restaurants. Cheap taxis will take you to the market and the other beaches, so you can easily get around if you don't have a car."
20,This place is very run down.  It's in a good location but trying to get a good nights rest is very difficult.  The rooms are very hot.  The music is too loud.  With broken windows in most rooms and cracked walls mosquitoes get in and buzz around all night.  The owners of this hostel are very very frugal/cheap.  The linen sticks because it is not sent out to be washed and the place is very poorly lit....you'll need a flashlight.  It's got a mainly Mexican crowd so don't sleep next to the kitchen because the cooking smell will definitely pollute the air in your room.
10,"The hostel is not clean and its look like nobody own the place.. the rooms are broken,many times there no water in the bathrooms at all, the property is big but without any light so you need a flash light.. and the owner is very cheap and not kind.. i recommend to go somewhere else like i did but after 2 owful nights..."
50,"This Hostel is a great place to stay, right near one of the most beautiful beaches you'll ever see in your life it has it all. A great bar, loads of accommodation, food. fun, facilities!!! i went here not having an idea of how long id stay and ended up being there for weeks :)"
50,"We camped here for a night and it was great. They have a big garden in the back. For 50 pesos per person we had access to the kitchen, bathrooms, showers, and swimming pool! The location is the best part of this place, since its right next to the carrizalillo beach. Friendly staff too!   Kitchen was a bit dirty, but c´est la vie with hostel kitchens."
50,"I have no words to explain that place, it's amazin, beautiful garden, nice staff, it's a good place to chill, everythings there are good, like the reception , swimmingpool, kitchen and the garden at the back yard, this ir the best place in puerto. really close to the most beautiful beach in puerto ""CARRIZALILLO""."
50,"My friend and I dropped our anchors here, simply because its beautiful, comfy, gd location, down to earth staff & gd prices. At the back of the hostel you will find the highlight . Well maintained garden, complemented with a swimming pool and nice chillout area, for your total relaxtion."
40,"From a day it ended up staying for a month in hostal shalom which is very near every beach in Puerto, but still if you don t feel like walking you can always stay by the pool, staff is really friendly and helpfull, I recommend this hostel to everyone. Shalom. "
40,"For my first Hostal I had ever stayed in, on my first solo adventure, Shalom felt great! A wide selection of rooms. A pool. A close walk to the best beach for swimming and the sunset. A short walk to the center of town. Taxi's stop by often. The staff helped fix a shower head that wasn't showering. And, you can bring in your own beer, or wine, unlike many of the hostals I came across on my travels. Having a kitchen at a hostal is a crucial factor for those traveling on a shoestring. The one here, although, functional and clean(always do your dishes!!) was dark, had a small fridge, and was quite hot during the afternoons and early evenings. With a more comfortable kitchen,  Hostal Shalom would have gotten a 5/5 rating.  Remember travelers, Hostals are open 24 hours a day, 7 days"
40,"We stayed in a private room with bathroom, room was quite ok, plenty of ventilation with mosquito screens on the windows and doors. Water pressure is ok but the shower head was not great.  Pool was lovely,  lady a reception was really nice, breakfast was basic but nice. The location is ok, but it is a short cab ride from the main surf beach at Zicatella (25pesos). Overall a pretty good budget option, but if you can afford more, then maybe look at other options closer to the clubs and bars in Zicatella. "
50,"I was unfortunate to be in the rain season so there was lots of water everywher. Which makes it hard to rate the general cleaniness of the place. It was a bit chaotic. But it was worth it. I only wanted to stay 1-2 nights and ended up staying a week. You will party with the staff, meet very cool people and all in all for 100 pesos a night it's absolutely worth it. It's a cabañas place after all..."
50,"So I stayed at bonobo for about five days... since the beginning I noticed how great this place was! The hostel has such a nice vibe and a great ambience. Rooms are neat and staff I so friendly, I highly recommend staying in this wonderful place. Special thanks to Heni, Katia and Lara who made our much more enjoyable !"
50,"Recently stayed at Bonobo and could have stayed forever. What an incredible place with an electric energy and filled with phenomenal people. Bonobo was a family and after travelling solo I felt like I’d been there for ages after one evening. Inclusive activities, beach volley ball, pina coladas, family dinners and constant fun. Scrumptious breakfast served by Lara!!! And Heni, Diego, George made the stay. So much love to Bonobo!!! "
50,"Bonobo is absolutely the best hostel in Puerto Escondido – and I stayed at a few! The hostel is clean and beautiful, the facilities are fantastic and the vibe is amazing. As a solo traveler it’s an easy place to make friends, with the fab staff championing daily activities from watching the sunset at a beautiful secret spot, playing beach volleyball, to my personal favorite – the amazing family dinners! I also loved the delicious included breakfast every morning. The location is unbeatable –within close walking distance there are a few beautiful beaches (and surf schools), a number of amazing places to eat, Spanish schools, a yoga studio… it couldn’t get much better. After extending my stay multiple times, I was sad to leave this hostel and the new friends who feel like family –"
50,"I had an amaaaaazing stay in Bonobo. I was travelling alone and literally found a second family. The staff is in-cre-di-ble, always there for you, always trying to make you happy (and they are good at it). The free breakfast was a big bonus, such a perfect way to start the day with everybody before heading to the numerous beaches a few minutes walk away. I met such beautiful souls there in a laid back and friendly ambiance. Other than that, beds are super comfy, rooms are clean, people are so respectful and the pool is now ready!!"
40,I spent 1 week at Bonobo with my girl friend. We are 39 years old and loved the place. We stayed in a private room with our private bathroom. Everything was very clean. The room was at the 3rd level and could be hot at night but the 2 fans helped.(we were there in beggining of May) The included breakfast was AWESOME. We like to eat healthy and we got that. The breakfast was from 8h30 so we would go for a smim at the beach or a walk before. I was afraid of the noise at night (party) because it is a hostel but it didn't bother me the time we were there. People were respectfull. There are no loud music. The people that work there were Sooooo welcoming. They gave us great cue on where to go and where to eat. They have a chill vibe there. There are 2 bikes that you can use but they
50,"Such a great place to stay if you need a base in Puerto Escondido! We stayed in a private room and it was the best we have had in a month of travels so far. Clean and the comfiest bed in the world! The hostel, bar and pool were fantastic all round and the staff were super friendly and fun also very helpful with whatever we asked. I cannot rate this place highly enough, thanks for everything guys!  Love Joey & T x"
40,"The place was very clean, surprisingly quiet and with very friendly staff. They have many free social activities, like salsa dancing, pasta nights and party nights.  It is very close to a popular beach.  This is a place for those who come to Mexico looking for a great beach vacation, and not so much to be in Mexico. The crowd is 100% expat. The staff (to a surprising degree) does not know the town or area well, other than how to get to beaches. They couldn't even say where to get good local food (we went to one of their recommendations and it is decidedly inferior to Taco Bell). Lots of guests come here and seem to spend most of their day smoking by the pool.  If you are looking for a fun beach experience with other foreign young travelers then this is the place for you. Most"
50,"This is one of my favorite hostels! Family breakfasts and a activities, great atmosphere, great location and beautiful clean rooms. But the best part is the crew. The crew is so amazingly sweet and helpful! And fun!  Chino, the c/karolinas and Balta will do everything to make the stay fun and Pam even texted me when I left for my night bus to make sure I made it ok because I was so anxious. Not to mantion all the cuddles you can possibly want from the hostel dogs! Highly recommended!!!"
50,I stayed with Alicia and her team for a week.its an awesome  family vibe in the hostel. All the floors have a kitchen .loved the tea corner in every kitchen. In the Netflix room you can chill and relax. Go and stay and find out for yourself...bonobo surf house is the best.not just for youngsters  
50,"My friend and I had planned on staying at bonobo for just four nights but ended up extending our time there because we were having too nice a time. The people we met, the staff, everyone was so lovely! Caro and Karoline who work there and two of the sweetest people I have ever met and helped to make out stay what it was! The dogs are a great touch as well"
10,"No se corresponde con las fotos que aparecen. Esta muy descuidado. Y para el precio que cuesta es excesivamente caro. El baño está sucio, la cortina con moho y te dan sólo dos pastillas de jabón, donde para el precio de 700 pesos deberían ofrecer más. La habitación sólo tiene un enchufe. Muy decadente."
10,"L'hotel è in pessime condizioni, le camere non hanno luce solare,quindi di giorno si deve sempre accendere la luce,c'è puzza di muffa,il bagno fatiscente. Senza asciugacapelli. Ve lo sconsiglio proprio!"
30,"El hotel es grande y con detalles muy agradables (detalles arquitectónicos surrealistas, hermosos, azotea con hamacas y tumbonas enorme con vista al mar, a Puerto Escondido) aunque como casi la mayoría de los hoteles en Zicatela y en el centro tienen serias dificultades e improvisaciones en la construcción, se ubica casi en la esquina de la famosísima Av del Morro, la calle del movimiento turístico de Zicatela, aunque a 1 km del movimiento (por cierto oscuro de noche) El hotel podría ofrecer más, pero noté descuido en la dirección del hotel, o mal dirección, para el turismo son importantes los detalles. Las habitaciones están raras, uno se termina preguntando porqué así, no tienen tv. Sin embargo la pasé muy bien, dormí como rey, grandes y buenos colchones, leyendo en las"
10,"My boyfriend and I stayed there for 5 days, we offer to work some hours in exchange to put our tent and use the showers. Hey said we can work 3 days a week for it, after 3 days the owner told us we need to work 3 more days to get the week free of charge, we told him that wasn't the deal and he said the 3 days we worked were part of the previous week given that we arrived on a Wednesday. Moreover the owners are very rude and unpolite during he whole time we were working for them.  You are on holiday so it would be nice to deal with some nice people in read of being treated like garbage, and very unappreciative of your work. The kitchen for customers is always dirty and other customers have no respect so leave all the dirty dishes around so it's full of flies everywhere. The noise"
50,"Really welcoming staff, great food, beautiful and relax location! Really nice pool! Stayed there 3 nights would have loved to stay more! Recommand the cabanas !! Love it! Beach around the corner! Best place to stay in la punta!"
40,"Stayed here for a few nights and had a great time. Very chilled out and welcoming space. Food great and healthy. Not the cheapest option around, though we thought worth the price. Cabana comfortable, as is the accommodation next door managed by the hostel and cheaper. Breakfast isn't included as indicated above in accommodation profile. "
50,"Great staff and facility!  We were impressed immediately by the friendliness of the staff who were super helpful and accommodating.  We were looking for a room on the cheaper side as we were just crashing one night to go Salsa dancing at Congo before heading to Oaxaca City in the morning.  Martin helped us find a cabaña that suited our needs at the price we were looking for and we spent a great night there.  In the morning we ate at the restaurant and the service was amazing, not to mention great coffee!  There is a health food store attached and if you get a chance, try their brownies.  Im back in Canada and still thinking about them (and I work in a bakery!!).  All in all a pleasant night in Puerto Escondido and would totally come back here! A++"
50,"Frutas Y Verduras is a lovely, relaxing, beautiful, clean and super friendly place. We stayed for a week and it felt like home. The beach is around the corner and if you want to try surfing the people at the hostel can help you finding a good instructor. The owners and the staff of Frutas Y Verduras are super nice. Definitely the best place to stay if you're going to Punta Zicatela!"
50,"My friends and I (3 of us) were coming into Escondido for one night and needed someplace cheap and cheerful.  We found this place which exceeded our expectations.  Martin (who is super chill, and very nice - speaks english and spanish) showed us a room that came with a surf board and had a shark themed mural throughout.. but was not really what we needed (we were only in town for the night).  So Tina (also super awesome and helpful - the staff are really easy to work with here) showed us a cabaña with 2 beds, mosquito netting, cheerfully painted inside, with a bar fridge and shared showers and bathrooms around the corner).  We chose that room $500 pesos, 2 beds for 3 people.  Was perfect for the night.  Right on the beach - and only about 40-50- pesos from a few bars (we went"
10,"Being hippy and laidback doesnt equalize dirty as far as im concerned. A rat moving through our  cabana kept us up all night. Also, the dusty musquito net was full of holes, so didnt serve it's purpose. When I complained about the rat I was informed that that is part of staying in nature. The whole site was pretty unkept and the price(350) was too much. There's way better options out there."
50,"we got here randomly, and were immediately attracted to it for the really laid back atmosphere... the bungalows around the sandy landscape makes it very informal but they still have an amazing kitchen and friendly staff! the sitting/chill out area is great for an evening and again, the food is amazing! even the morning fruit bowls have a 5 star for us!"
40,"We slept there and eat there for 2 days: indeed good juices and food In General! Rooms are quite small and dark, no private bathrooms, but totally in line with the category/price so no problem really. VERY relaxed nice atmosphere, don't miss out."
20,"It's an ok place to stay, but you can feel that so many good reviews in the past and the overall popularity of the place have made the owner a little tired, so they probably don't have to try as hard as they did before.   The oh-so-nice roof terrace that appears on all the pictures was closed when we stayed for a week, the owner did not tell us so while booking. Also, they do not rent surfboards as they claim, which is sad because the shops around will all charge 200 pesos which is kind of steep. No bicycles neither.   Most people who work there are volunteers who travel and stay there for some weeks, and most of them try hard enough to give you a good time. But management seems weak and I really didn't like how the owner spoke about his workers when I politely made an"
50,"I stayed in the Rincon, a private room with an outdoor reading area that faces the garden. I loved this room because it's colorful, airy, and bright. It also comes with a private, outdoor shower, which was a nice surprise!  The place is in a great location, just walking distance to the main highway, the main restaurant strip in Brisas de Zicatela, and the beach.   The staff, though, really made the trip. Pepe and Uri are incredible hosts, friendly, welcoming, and full of good tips. If you're lucky, Uri might let you try some of her delicious salsa de chicharron! Looking forward to returning here when I make it back down to the coast."
50,I feel fortunate to have picked such a great hotel.  It was grounds were beautiful and relaxing.  Friendly guests and a great owner for helping you with your questions about the area.  The shared kitchen gave it a sense of community.
50,"We enjoyed casa kei atmosphere so much! our 1 year old baby had a great time in the pleasant garden, always making new friends. With Pepe's hospitality all went nice and smooth.The location is perfect, good value for the price of the room. We recommend it and would like to comeback!"
50,Casa Kei is such a beautiful and magical place! I felt at home right away! The garden is amazing and makes you want to spent the whole day in the hammock and read under the fruit trees. Casa Kei is perfect to meet and socialize with people while still always having the privacy of a private bedroom. The overall atmosphere is very warm and welcoming and I met so many amazing people during my stay! Pepe is a great host with so many valuable tips and always fun to be around! :)  The beach is just a short walk away from the house and La Punta is a really relaxed place with a great vibe and many things to do in the area. I loved staying at Casa Kei and can definitely recommend it! It really feels like a piece of paradise! :)
50,"What a great time I've had at casa kei. From the moment you walk in you feel welcome because of the nice and welcoming Pepe. The whole vibe there is great. It's not a party hostel, although drinking is something I sure did with my fellow travellers. The people who stay at casa kei are quite diverse, but it all blends together perfectly.   Pepe is the roommate you wish you had at home: Never annoying, but always there to help or advise you. Casa Kei has private rooms for good prices and a beautiful garden with Ceviche (Young cat), couch surfer (2nd cat) and quacamole (bird). Pepe creates a warm and sharing environment by offering drinks or food or whatever he has to share at the moment. I think other guests follow his lead because of that.   The facilities are basic, but you"
50,"After traveling through central and south america this was the ultimate ending. Beautiful area, living in a open tree house, were we could see the beach and stars was so special. Pepe was extremely welcoming and helpful. We enjoyed so many evening's with other guests drinking mezcal and eating Pepes amazing meals in this beautiful casa. Couldn't recommended casa kei more.  Our time here was filled with surf, great food, turtles, phosphorescence plankton, beaches, snorkeling, mountains and the great communal atmosphere of casa kei. We extended our stay to a month and hopefully return one day to this beautiful place. Good luck with casa Kei Pepe, build a village. x"
50,"The hostel is very close to the beach. A 5 min walk. It is easy to get transportation. The rooms  are airy and each with a fan. Pepe is a terrific host. Whatever you need to know he will tell you. Coffee is ready, made by Pepe early morning.  Pepe is very attentive. We liked it so much that we stayed close to six weeks. All in all, a nice  place to stay."
50,"We stayed at Casa Kei for nearly two weeks and it was perfect. The rooms were really good, clean and a couple have amazing views. The garden was fully developed and provided lots of shady chill spots including in the hammocks.  It had a really relaxed vibe and seemed to attract really nice people.  Close to a good vege shop and a corners store. Also very short walk to get a collectivo to go surf Zicatela. Guacamole the parrot is a lord. And the owner Pepe is a super chilled guy. "
50,"Casa Kei was the best part of Mexico! The owner Pepe was better than any guidebook when it came to sharing local knowledge. He sent me to great beaches in the area, fantastic food and was super helpful. Casa Kei is in a quiet neighborhood but only six blocks from the beach and two blocks from the taxi route. My room was perfect, with great big windows, a nice breeze and a kind of fun tree house like setting. There was a fan, bathroom and even a mini fridge! The outdoor kitchen was perfect for making meals and the hammocks perfect for an afternoon nap with a book. I was sorry to have to leave."
50,"This place is absolutely beautiful. The house is full of trees and flowers. The outdoor kitchen is very inviting. I stayed in the top room and it has an unforgettable view, I suggest you stay there. You can see all the green and at the end the beach its quite a view. At night you can hear the birds and the wind sounds like lullabies. Definitely a place you must see yourself. Also don't forget to try the mole a well known dish in Oaxaca make sure you try it at the local mercado (farmers market). Travelling is pretty cheap only $7 MX pesos. There's a little place in the center called ""Las Juquilenas de Guelagetza"" something like that I don't remember the name they have incredible food and beautiful live music. There's a surfer area a few blocks from the house that is very popular"
50,"The only hostel in Playa Zicatela!   Zicatela being the place to be in Puerto Escondido, don't get confused and stay anywhere in Puerto, Zicatela is where all of the bars, restaurants, big waves and parties are! The rest of the hostels in puerto are a cabs ride away from Playa Zicatela.   The restaurant attached to this hostel has some of the best food I have ever had in my life. Strong WiFi throughout the hostel, they just added a rad pool last time I was there.   Pakololo's hospitality is like family, anyone who says there for more than a few days will understand!  And Julie the Argentinian who works there knows where all of the good parties are!!"
40,"……..Pakololo is the spot if you're wanting to stay on the beach in Puerto.. good central location on the zicatela, always a good vibe rnd the hostel, chill little pool out the back, always folks to hang out with, good kitchen facilities blah blah blah.. will definitely stay there again next time I'm in puerto, really helpful friendly staff aswell who don't mind a party, in particular Jules!"
50,"Whether it's a party hostel you want or to keep it pretty chill Pakololo has got you covered. The staff are great, super helpful and friendly and always greet you with a smile. Great central location on zicatella with plenty going on. Jules, the manager, will have you laughing and partying in no time. "
50,Awesome location and awesome crowd. Met a lot of cool people here and couldn't really have asked for more. Julie in reception was a great help with everything! Many options with rooms to suit everyone too
50,"This is a pretty great place to stay! Perfect location right on zicatela, close to surf, bars and nightlife. The hostel has a really nice courtyard for socialising as well as a kitchen and common area over looking the water. The staff speak English and Spanish and are super helpful. 10/10"
50,"Had an awesome time at Pakololo! I stayed in the dorm rooms, they are pretty basic but really comfortable, warm vibe and at a price you cant beat in that location. The hostel offers everything you'll need: lovely people, good security, kitchen amenities and a lovely beachfront location. Staff are excellent, super helpful and multi-lingual. I miss the kitten already :)"
50,"I stayed several times at Pakololo years ago and i had a lot of fun...Now with new Managers in charge (Gaby) shes so sweet and friendly,always welcome you with a big smile. The beer garten on the back is amazing (sandy floor) If you coming down to the Mexican Pipeline stop by and crash here,they offer rooms,cabanas,dorms and apartments...you have to try the tasty food of their Argentinian chef (mixing flavors  and recipes with mezcal) Very safe and clean Hotel - Hostel....also they offer Mezcal Talks & Tastings with real local producers of this nacional drink (book now)  big hug & surfs up !! Alberto"
50,"I absolutely loved staying at Punta Escondida! The owners were incredibly kind and helpful, filling us in on all the Escondido tips and tricks. The beds were cozy and every night there is awesome stuff to do at the bar. There were also fitness classes on the roof during the day with an ocean view."
50,"Friendly stuff, air condition, pool, beds with curtains, breakfast included and kitchen facilities to use, restaurants all close by as well as well as the best surf spot in 5 min walking distance.... What more can I say? Drink prices are fair, activities and yoga everyday and the towels smell like my mother washed them 😍 highly recommend"
50,"This was a really nice place with great clean rooms & bathroom. Fantastic vibe. Friendly very helpful staff and good value for money. Great pool, lovely rooftop and v social. Would definitely recommend a stay here."
10,"The hotel doesn't look like on the pictures and is way to expensive for the actual conditions.  Cons: They charge 4,5% if you pay by card They include a fan in the price, however if you'd like AC you will have to pay extra The rooms where dirty and nit very welcoming.  All in all a poor price performance ratio. You could find way better places for less money in puerto escondido. I'm sad that we fell for this scam... :("
10,"Very bad service, uncomfortable rooms, laud after hours, dirty Pool due to the allowance of letting people to enter even if they are not hotel guests, overcrowed Pool,    You can find better places un puerto but not here."
20,"We stayed 2 nights with a small group of friends.  Generally we thought the place was well looked after, you could see people cleaning the public areas each day and the pool and chairs around it were clean and in good condition.  The downsides - a decent 30 minute walk to the nice part of the beach or $50/2 pounds in a taxi.  You are next to a church so forget sleeping past 6.30am when the bell tolls or the bus drivers that park near by start their engines.  Friends in the main part of the building suffered noise and drunk people into the early morning which echos around the entrance/reception area.  We had room 33 AVOID at all costs, it is next to the road and strangely has a drain running under the floor which sounds like a river in full flood all night!  If you are there"
10,"Dirty, loud, falsely advertised. No AC (even though it said there would be). We booked a 'deluxe room with a sea view' and did not get one. Since we had to keep the windows open al night bc it was so hot, it was very loud. Some people in the hotel had whole families in one room, so expect to hear kids. No parking even though it said there would be.  I am not one to complain but I just don't want other ppl to have to go through the what we did. Fortunately we did get them to lower the price which was high bc it was New Years Eve. This hotel is worth no more than $20.  We booked through booking.com and will be notifying them as well. The pics on their site DO NOT reflect what this hotel actually is."
40,"Stayed here for two nights and really loved the hotel. Very welcoming and friendly staff, a great location between Centro and Playa Principal, well priced, huge comfortable bed, amazing views over Playa Zicatela and a clean pool surrounded by palm trees. The church bells at 7am were a bit rough, but earplugs were a good solution. Great place to stay if you want to hang with the locals in town rather than the tourists along Zicatela. Maybe request a room down the back to avoid the bells. "
50,"Gecko Rock is one of the greatest hidden gems in the world!  A group of seven of us decided to go on the recommendation of one of the couples who had been there for their honeymoon.  We had heard from them that the food was delicious, the area was beautiful and the people (including the hosts were wonderful).  I have to say I have never had my expectations surpassed quite a completely as I did with this trip.  Gecko Rock sits on the top of a hill with a short walk down to a beautiful, mostly isolated beach with a short walk to a small fishing village/beach perfect for some lunch and local drinks.  The sunsets from the roof of the rooms were beautiful in a way that only a sunset over the Pacific can be with a cold drink in your hand and the food was legitimately some of the top"
50,"My husband and I only get away 1 or 2 times a year if we are lucky between both our schedules. This year, we made it a priority and came to stay at Gecko Rock not once, but twice! I’ve never been anywhere that all my troubles and cares just melt away quite as well as the do here. It’s some combination of the soft roar of the ocean as your laying in the pool with palm trees swaying over head and the amazing home cooked meals that are good enough they should have a Michelin Star..... or maybe it’s the friendly owners who have come to feel more like coming to visit friends than stay at some big box hotel. This place has come to feel like home away from home and I can say with confidence we will be back many more times. Thank you for all the personal touches you do to make this"
50,"I stayed with my fiancee in mid-November for 8 nights and had an awesome time. The weather was 90s and sunny the whole time. The property is beautiful and lush with tropical trees and plants. We were lucky enough to be the only guests for our first 6 nights and so had the pool and grounds to ourselves, which was pretty cool. That said the grounds and pool are certainly spacious enough that were there 8 guests, you wouldn't feel crowded. Staying on site is an awesome way to relax, whether in/by the pool, hanging out on your roof, or playing games under the palapa. Exploring up/down the beach was also great. Agua Blanca is just 15min away and was picturesque and a great place to chill next to the ocean with a cerveza, fresh coconut water, and some seafood. We also did a day trip"
50,"Are you looking for a worry-free, quiet, kick back, sunny and by-the-beach location for a getaway?  How about attractively presented delicious food and an array of adult beverages delivered to you under the palapa?  And do you wish to pick your level of engagement with other guests and hosts?  Then GECKO ROCK RESORT could well be for you. When we were internet hunting for a Mexico destination, we found G R R and its prospective suitability only increased as we began communications with Mike and Aileen, the builders, owners, and operators.  They responded promptly to all questions, their answers were clear and presented reasonable options for transportation, visits to Puerto Escondido, and the description of life at the G R R.   All along, the appeal of the fare and their"
50,"Fabulous setting, great food and wonderful hosts at Gecko Rock. It was a great place to spend a week and celebrate my husband’s 80th birthday! Some days we enjoyed reading by the pool or under the palapa hut and listening to the waves crash on the beach nearby. We also enjoyed our day trip to La Ventanilla, Mazunte and Puerto Angel. Thanks to Mike and Aileen for also organizing David’s fishing trips with Levi and our dolphin watching trip with Omar. Looking forward to returning next year with family and friends."
50,"We had an absolutely amazing stay at Gecko Rock for four nights, as part of a two week trip around Mexico. The pool area and gardens are beautiful, and only a two minute walk from the most beautiful (and deserted) beach we have ever seen. Rooms are spacious and air conditioned, and each has a private rooftop terrace   Mike and Aileen were amazing hosts, who helped us with our transport and with a day of activities in Puerto Escondido.  One of the highlights of our stay was the amazing food prepared by Aileen. We loved the fact that at Gecko Rock meals are included in your stay, so you don't have the concerns of other resorts about expensive extras. Aileen's cooking is unbelievably good - we were ever more excited about every meal! Drinks are also extremely reasonable, and"
50,"The exclusivity of this resort guarantees a relaxing atmosphere with optional adventures nearby. There are a limited number of rooms, so it's often like you have the resort to yourself: peaceful hammock time by the pool, a secluded beach with no one in sight, and intimate, chef-prepared meals. If you're looking for a busy, activity-heavy itinerary, this is not the place for you. But if you're looking for intimacy and peace, you've found it. We came for our honeymoon, and couldn't imagine a more perfect resort."
50,"My husband and I visited Gecko Rock for our honeymoon and we are certainly glad that we did. We are beach people, and finding tide pools and tucked away lagoons were a favorite pastime while there. We took a quick walk down the beach from the resort to Agua Blanca for cocos frios, cerveza y guacamole which we would recommend.  The temperature of both the ocean and the pool were perfect. I especially appreciated the hammock options, and rotated from one to the other throughout the day. The cocktails were made with fresh ingredients and the taste reflected that. Mike was a very attentive host and made sure we had all that we needed at any given time.   Aileen’s kitchen creations truly make me reconsider the dining options I’ve been making my entire life. Her attention to flavors,"
50,"We stayed at Gecko Rock Resort for 7 nights for our honeymoon, intending to mostly relax with a little bit of ecotourism (for which we attended a wildlife-spotting boat tour). It was honestly perfect! The resort and nearby beach are beautiful and very private and relaxing. The owner is very responsive and attentive to any questions or to help arrange activities. The home-cooked meals were incredibly delicious, fresh, and unique, and the menu is tailored to personal food restrictions and preferences. The rooms and en suite bathrooms are spacious, comfortable and pretty. We spent a lot of time sipping fresh-fruit mixed drinks in or around the pool, reading in the shade to the sound of waves, and exploring the local nature.   We also spent most of a day in town nearby (Puerto"
50,"I learned about Gecko Rock through an online review a few years ago. My wife and I aren't normally the resort types, but I thought the story of this place was pretty cool so I filed it away in the back of my head as a possible future destination. Early this year I suffered a pretty significant knee injury, and during the tedium of recovery from surgery we decided we needed something fun to look forward to that didn't depend on me having great mobility. I mentioned this nifty looking place in Mexico that I'd learned about, and once we figured out reasonable flights our plans were set.  Gecko Rock's great customer service began as soon as we made our booking. Getting there required an overnight stay in Mexico City on the way there, and an afternoon and evening stay on the way"
30,"As stated many times already, the location is perfect. The place is also clean enough en the double room is small, but the beds are very comfy. The staff sleeping in the common area gives the hostel a bit of a weird vibe though. "
50,"What a cool place to arrive to in La Punta! As soon as I entered the hostel, I felt great and very welcomed! The staff there is super nice, and Memo, the owner, is such a sweetheart. He’s like a big daddy for all of his travellers staying there, making sure he gives good tips on what’s safe/what’s not, what’s good/what’s not around there. I’d say it’s a hostel mainly for hippy travellers, happy to meet great people and share a bit of their travels with a new family for a few days. I was supposed to stay there for 1 night, turned to be 5 nights, and I wish I was still there!!! The hostel is right on the beach, there a dorms in a cute little shed, but the BEST part of it is the common area, where there are beds too, and you can sleep outside if you choose to. Seriously, the best"
50,"Memo the owner is super friendly and very concerned about everyones security which is nice. He has mosquito repellent things plugged in all around the hostel which makes it the only safe haven in la punta. There's a fan for every bed. A really nice common area with hammocks and right on the beach so you can always hear the ocean. The kitchen is pretty well equipped and big enough for everyone. The lockers are all old fridges with is kinda funky. I havn't met one person here that has stayed as long as they thought, everyone stays longer, some by a week or three or four more! Definitely somewhere to come back to!"
50,"Zapotecas is awesome, it is on the beach in the best angle to see the sunset. A quite beach, clean sand, great people... you will never find a family like this hostel house have. Total recomended for a quite and funny vacations. Learn surf, it is just front the wave!"
20,"Nice hostel, right on the beach with a cool communal area. Also here like 8 - 9 people were like living here and were hard to connect with. We had a private room, very basic with fan equipped. Private and dorms were quite unclean, and even one of the guests had an ants nest in the pillow in the morning. Will not go back here."
50,"Lovely hostel with comfy beds - they have massive fans in the dorm so the temperature is reasonable during the night. A more chilled out vibe than Buena Onda next door, but still has a nice communal space. They also had the sweetest little kittens whilst I was there!"
50,"Hostel Zapotecas is one of my favorite beach places, ever. And I've been to a lot of beaches. There is a huge palapa, with a great vibe, great, well-stocked kitchen, and lots of hammocks. A previous reviewer, gloomy Gus, complained about many things, but there are always complainers everywhere.  It is surrounded by a fence, yes. This is for security, because it's literally right on the beach. I was here in November 2016, and I'm back here right now. You hear the surf 24 hours a day, it's maybe 150 yards from my hammock, right now. Yes, there are rules, but for good reasons. The boss, Memo, is maybe the best part, and the reason I came back so soon. He's strict, but very sweet and lovable. Walls are thin, but the rooms are fresh and cool, and Don Memo is most strict about being"
20,"The location of this hostel is amazing no doubt about it. It's is like right on the beach and all the neighborhood is super nice.  The kitchen is nice and big with view on the ocean.  But, the showers and the toilets are complet garbage and it's kind of dirty everywhere there which is surprising given the number of people voluntering there. The hostel is surounded by a fence that made me feel like in prison.  Second to last, there is a lot of unwritten rules in this place and some of them make no sense at all. It was almost like everytime you were doing something you wondered if you were breaking another rule that you didn't know about because they are not written anywhere. Lastly, the quiet time. It was not permited to make any noise in the common area until 11 am every day and"
50,"A great place whether you want to chill out or party. Lots of outdoor areas. Practically on the beach. Free beach umbrellas/chairs. Hammocks, outdoor beds. Pablo, who runs the place, is friendly, welcoming and will help in any way he can. Also check out Baraka coffee & food across the road. All up a great place to stay. They are very eco friendly and provide filtered water so you don't need to keep buying plastic bottles of it. "
50,"The hostal is amazing... the outside terrace is a little mini paradise with hammocks, swinging beds, chess boards and one giant bed on the floor! With a view of the sea and sunset wherever you sit(in the terrace). The look of the chill out makes the hostal completely unique in appearance.. its acctually the reason we decided to go check it out! Those darn hammock beds!... the hostal itself is very nice, the staff have a good cleaning regime every morning which is great everything is cleaned thoroughly..  The kitchen is a great open space with 2 bars that you can sit at. The guy in charge- Pablo was just such a great character and very welcoming. Everyone there was great. I really enjoyed my stay at this awesome funky hostal. My only downside would be that the shared dorms(at"
50,"Had a great time! I opted for the Spanish and surf package. All surf instructors were equally friendly and knowledgeable. My private Spanish teacher Eloisa was lovely and gave spot-on lessons. Location is closest of all to the surf spot, and just as close to all good restaurants of La Punta. The whole setting of the surf house is lovely and the spacious shared kitschen is a nice asset too. Especially a perfect place for couples, but actually for everyone who is looking for some rest while enjoying all pleasures of Puerto Escondido!"
50,"I stayed at puerto surf for 12 days! It was amazing! David and his team are great people, helpful, friendly and the surf lessons were full of fun, I enjoyed it very much and learnt a lot! The rooms are clean, as well as the kitchen and the common area! A cool and chilled place close to the beach 😊 Will come back as soon as possible! 🤙🏽"
50,"Great surf school which is busy, but still manages to provide individual attention. The team are all friendly and helpful. Jesus is an amazing teacher and gives specific tips and instructions for your needs. Highly recommend!"
20,"The good: Superbly located near the main street and a (very crowded) point break Nice grounds Cleaning staff were friendly  The poor: Notable lack of effort from staff; aloof and generally unwelcoming. Come on, guys. There are two adjacent active construction sites Worn and stained bedding The surf “lessons” consist of being pushed into waves and told “ben joor knees!” — pretty lame for the cost and a total waste if you’re at all competent.  The shocking: Cockroaches in both rooms we stayed in; I get that it’s the third world, but some remedial effort may be helpful here. Staff periodically entered our room without warning/knocking — more than a bit alarming for female guests. They will rent boards in what are evidently heinous conditions. I won’t say they were negligent in"
50,The staff was super nice and helpful. They answered all our questions and gave great recommendations for La Punta and Puerto Escondido in general!  The surfing lessons were a lot of fun and we got better at surfing every day!  Best recommendations for this place!
50,"Best place to stay at, place is amazing, crew goes beyont their duties, they set you up with anything you need, tours, surf classes, restaurant recommendations, etc. Would stay there forever, it has a shared kitchen, fridge, best instructors in town."
40,Puerto Surf is super well located as it’s only 50 meters from the beach which is great! It’s also just behind the busy street which makes it quiet. I stayed in room 7 that was really lovely.  My surf teacher Luis was also great. Gave me lot of good tips to improve and took me to yummy local places for food!  I really enjoyed my time there and highly recommend !
50,We had a very comfortable room at our stay at Puerto Surf House. The garden is so beautiful and there is a kitchen you can share with. All the stuff is very friendly and I really enjoyed the surf lessons. You will definitely learn to surf! We loved being there.
50,"My stay at Puerto surf house was really nice because it is a beautiful place with a garden, a nice kitchen and a lot of hammocks. Everyone is very welcoming and it is easy to feel at home. I also loved the surf lessons as the teacher adapt to your level of surfing and take good care."
50,"I only have positive things to say. If you are looking to learn to surf with the best instructors out there, and have a very relaxing holiday on the beach, this is the place to stay. The rooms are not fancy, but very clean (and that is all I cared about). There are a few good places to hang out at and you are steps from the beach and awesome restaurants.  The instructors are by far the best and I think I would be disappointed to have anyone else out there with me. I am very much a beginner, and they did a great job to calm my fears and get me up on the board. They were patient, and gave great feedback. Truly the best (thank you Maim and everyone else)!  As a solo traveler, I was also very lucky to have met some great people staying at the house. Puerto Surf has a great communal"
40,"If you're looking for a relaxing stay, with wonderful and warm hosts this is the place for you! It's a five minute walk from the surf at La Punta and only a 5 minute drive/ short bus ride to the restaurants and bars at Zicatela (but much more peaceful!). Perfect for people travelling on their own as it's very sociable, also great for couples and groups of friends. We'll be back as soon as we have more holiday!"
50,"I ended up staying here for 6 beautiful weeks.  Chris & Rosela can't do enough for you.  The sunset on the roof top is great way to end the day, the pool is clean and refreshing after a hard day at the beach.  The rooms are clean and well maintained, I lay on my hammock most day watching the banana trees growing.......Love it here would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet retreat."
50,"We had a great stay at Sunset Point, and wished we could have stayed longer  It started as soon as we arrived - we were a few hours late due to a land slide blocking the road on the way - Chris immediately met us with a welcome, placed a beer in my hand and said he would sort us some food! We got invited to the birthday party next door and enjoyed the celebrations.  Room very good value - all in a good location with a short walk to the beach, or a longer walk (short taxi) into the town with the restaurants. Pool is ideal and a good alternative to the beach.  Small extras like being dropped off at the bus station when leaving, and the food, make this place. Strongly recommended."
50,"Photos don't do this place justice!  I have stayed in some really nice hotels, including 5 star resorts, but Sunset Point is by far the best place I've ever stayed at, in terms of comfort, service and surroundings.  Within minutes of arriving, we felt relaxed and at home. The owners, Chris and Rosela, are very friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome. We were very lucky to stay in one of the first floor apartments and had a stunning view across Puerto Escondido - we watched the sunset from our hammock every evening. We really appreciated having our own mini-kitchen and fridge and picked up supplies from the supermarket in town to make our own breakfasts. Chris and Rosela also invited us to pick limes and bananas fresh from the trees in their garden, which was great! "
50,"Just spent another 2-weeks  at Sunset Point  in Puerto Escondido   The staff was amazing and the food on the sat. nights party night with band is exquisite.   Ribs and Fish. very Yummy  with Mikos  the Chef  cooking ,  Chris  the owner was fantastic    and very hospitable.    The pool is very comforting after a day at the beach.   I would recomend this place to anyone especially from Canada   as there was 1/2  of the people staying there from all across Canada  and the USA.    You will enjoy this place alot.    Mickey Mac  New Westminster BC  Canada"
50,"Sunset Point is a perfect location above La Punta with great views, landscaping and breezes and even better laid back atmosphere for anyone looking to avoid the ""scene""...it has it's own thing going on.  We stayed in the villa for a month in November 2010 with our 11 year old son.   The owner Chris truly enjoys meeting people and living life and hosts a great dart game.  We found it to be the kind of place where you can be as involved with other guests or as secluded as you choose...and nobody will mind either way!  But to make the most of all Sunset Point has to offer you should be open to a late night or two...there was almost always someone to enjoy it with!!  And when the kitchen is cooking on the wood fired grill...there's really no reason to go anywhere else!  We can't"
50,"Yes, we liked it a lot. We had one of the bungalows and even if you live there next to another you feel totally private. All in all it is a very unofficial atmosphere (in the best imaginable sense) and just effortless to be there. First we were a bit concerned being a little bit out of town, but it is no big deal to take small collectivo-taxis, which are running frequently all the time up and down the street and cost almost nothing. Beach is in walking-distance (10 minute). In the evenings usually some guests gather in the „tent-area“. Feel free to join or to avoid them. But be aware that there is almost always there is good food and beverages involved. The area is peaceful. It is absolutely quiet there and at night stargazing does not get spoiled by artificial light. If you"
50,"We just spent a week at Sunset Point and just loved it! Beautiful place, we had a great spacious room for the four of us with a beautiful terrace, private kitchen facility, hammocks etc. The owners are super nice, gave us lifts everywhere and it was really the perfect location. Pool is great too, also for small children."
50,One of the best places in Puerto. We will return with christmass.
50,"We spent three days here last week and it far exceeded our expectations.  The room was nice and big, very clean with a nice bathroom and kitchenette as well as a private balcony that overlooked Puerto Escondido and the coast. The view was so good that we actually took photos in the morning, afternoon, at sunset, AND at night. (it's pretty nice there) The swimming pool area is great and has a lot of hammocks and sun loungers to relax away the afternoon if you don't feel like walking down to the beach (approx 10 minutes).  There are some nice communal areas if you feel like having a few drinks as well as a good book exchange/library. The WIFI worked like a charm the entire time we were there and we were able to use it in our room as well as beside the pool.  There's a great social"
40,"I have very few complaints about Hotel Santa Fe other than its price. At $115/night, I expected a little more pampering and luxury. The hotel has everything I needed to be comfortable but I cannot say it was a ""luxury resort."" Here is a list of the plusses and minuses:  Plusses: - Great location, 1 minute walk puts you on a beautiful beach - Big rooms with vaulted ceilings (ours was #39 that also had a small balcony) - Even the rooms not advertized as having an ocean view can get a glimpse of the ocean and hear the waves crashing - Two pools, one for adults only (great for kid-unfriendly people like myself) - Lots of shady areas to hide from the sun and read without missing out on the ocean view - Good restaurant with excellent, attentive service - comfortable pillows (my pet"
40,"Right on beach, good food, nice pools, clean rooms, quiet.  Nicest hotel in Puerto Escondido."
50,We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and we loved our stay. The rooms are beautiful and spacious and you can hear the waves crashing from your room. The grounds and pools are beautiful. The hotel is located extremely close to the beach. I highly recommand this hotel.
50,"Cozy, very clean & comfortable, absolutely marvelous localization with ocean across the street, nice customer service. Truly recommend."
50,"Hotel Santa Fe is an amazing place.  Set on the edge of town, a short walk away but still a bit isolated on its own point, it has access to one of Mexico's finest beaches.  The hotel itself is very well-maintained and you can sense that its owners have lovingly put their hearts into its gradual improvement.  The restaurant is superb, a mixture of the sea, Mexico City, and Palo Alto, California (!)"
50,"My spouse and I spent time in PE in the '80s, and then have been back these last couple of years with our 3 teenage boys.  Two years ago they were in a nice room at the Santa Fe and we were in a bungalow (with kitchen--what was I thinking? All that great food at the Hotel and I thought I'd cook in our room?).  That was great.  They boys loved the beach and the food and freedom.  This year we booked a Presidential Suite maybe as late as October/November, and it was fabulous.  One of those world class views of the ocean and beach from our huge front patio.  Boys on one side of the unit and we on the other side, with  kitchen and living room between.  Comfortable, great internet, easy to run down to the hotel, attentive staff, great veggie food, everything was spot on perfect.  And"
50,"I went to Mexico for three weeks and took my GF on a road trip round my home country. Nothing was planned and we just drove from one hotel to another.  On arrival to Puerto Escondido we were pleasently surprised to find an authentic, truly Mexican down to earth place to stay. I love boutique hotels and 5 start resorts, but there is something so charming and real about hotel Santa Fe that neither money nor luxury can ever achieve. The staff were amazingly helpful, then again most Mexican tend to be. The rooms were beautifully in line with the ethos of the hotel (they promote eco turism, must go on the lagoon sight seeing excursion or stay at the coffee plantation).  We had only planned to stay in Puerto Escondido for two days but stayed 4 in total.  Going to the main town road"
40,"The Santa Fe is at the North end of the Zicola (Malecon) just across the street from the beach. This section of town has a number of hotels, shops and restaurants most of which  cater to the surf crowd. When compared to the others along this desirable beach area, The Santa Fe comes out very well indeed.  This is an older hotel, not part of a chain or master designed beach resort. It's an ordinary Mexican hotel that is maintained nicely. The Gardens and pool areas are attractive and well kept we spent several pleasant hours relaxing in the shade.  The restaurant is an open air dining room with a good view of the beach / Ocean / Sunset and is also one of the better restaurants in the area.  Service, Value and Setting all combine to make this a good place to relax for a couple of"
50,"Pros - Restaurant was tremendous, we didn't eat anywhere else in Escondido for dinner.   A/C was a huge plus as it got much hotter than expected on the coast. Two nice, clean swimming pools on very charming grounds.  Rooms are very spacious, nice staff. Outstanding access to both of the main thoroughfairs in Escondido and all of the beaches.  Bartenders here were head and shoulders above all others in the area.  Very clean and well-maintained grounds and with more than enough security.  View of the ocean and sunsets from here were outstanding.  Cons - The restaurant was fantastic but it is seafood and vegetarian only.  Not much in terms of entertainment or activities at this hotel, but relaxing.  It's a tropical beach hotel so there are all of the things that come with that: "
50,Most beautifull place in puerto escondido!! got 2 go there again!
50,"I arrived as a single traveller and was caught by the warm and welcoming atmosphere of this place and its inhabitants at first sight. The hostel is located in a perfect place, away from the busy party-area of  Zicatela (but still close enough to get there if you want to go out at night) and just a few steps from the beautiful beach of la punta. The owners were taking care of us like real friends and the food they cook is just amazing. You can really hang-loose, enjoy some surfing, sunbathing, good talks+music and the positive vibes at this place. Thank you Akumal, I'm gonna be back!"
50,"If you are looking for a great priced, friendly little hostel that is like home, then you've come to the right place.  The staff & vibe are amazing, as is the full open kitchen where you can either prepare your own meal or eat an authentic mexican dinner cooked by the owner if you're lucky!  The breakfast is Organic local coffee, with locally made homemade bread, butter, jam & an egg & vegetable dish - outstanding! I came for 1night and ended up staying 2 weeks :-)"
50,"this new hostel is awsome, the staff is supernice, also the breakfast in the morning and the location, just 100 meters from the beach. every room in this hostel has it´s own bathroom and fens for the heat in the night. you can relax in the hammocks or grab a beer and enjoy the sunset from the rooftop. really, if you go to puerto, that´s the best choice chicos :)"
10,"This is by far one of the worse experiences I ever had. First of all, the place is very dirty and poorly maintained, of course there is no hot water and the zink in our bathroom didn't have a tube underneath - all the water went down on the floor. How is that possible, one of those tubes costs like 20 pesos? They only had three towels available for rent since the other got wet in the rain, so we couldn't shower. We came during the raining season and the first morning we woke up with 5 cm of water in our room. Since the room only had a bed and no table, no closet, our bags were on the floor and therefore soaking wet. We had to take all of our clothes to a lavandería and electronic devices worth 4000 pesos were ruined. And during the night when the rain was pouring down and"
40,"Hostel Shalom was a really nice place to stay. The atmosphere was really relaxed - the staff and other residents were hugely friendly, very welcoming and willing to help, and there was a brilliant sense of community that quickly drew me in. I stayed in one of the cabanas with a friend, and it was clean and pretty cheap - 100 pesos (£5) each for a night. It was well situated - it was near to one of the quieter beaches, Playa Carizalillo, but only a short walk away from the main beach, and a short taxi to the Zicatela, the surfing beach, and was on the same road as some cheap, but good quality eateries and a few decent bars."
30,"We only planned to stay for 3 nights, but ended up staying 8!  As with all hostels is about the people, and we met a lovely bunch of them. The space itself is great, the lobby, communal area / bar is a great place to hang out and get to know people and Andy who works at the hostel really made our stay, extremely friendly, knowledgeable about the area, and really helpfull, in fact we probably wouldn't have stayed as long if it wasn't for him!  We would definitely recommend staying here, however if you're planning to cook be ware, the kitchen is not really well equipped at all, two portable gas rings in a very dark room with a fridge and a mad dash for a saucepan and any type of cooking utensils or  cutlery were hard to come by, which made cooking more of a challenge.   The hostel"
50,"My stay at Hostal Shalom was really nice because of the friendly staff,clean rooms and the relaxed atmosphere.The pool area and garden is nice to chill out,but also to party. You can meet really nice people there and just enjoy your stay.Near to the Hostal is also the Playa Carrizalillo,where you can learn surfing.By the way it´s the most beautiful beach in Puerto Escondido.Another fact is,it is very cheap and you have an included breakfast. I only can recommend this place,if you wanna stay in Puerto Escondido.You will not regret!"
50,"Hostal shalom is excellent place for surfers,nice price,clean and very kind staff also good location to access surf poin , restaurant and merucado!!  I definetly back to the shalom when i surf in puerto escondido!!"
50,"I've stayed at Hostal Shalom 3 times over the past several years, and it gets better every time  Atmosphere and Accommodations:  Frist off, You can really tell the owner genuinely loves running the Hostal and that she takes pride in it and in the experience guests have while staying there.  It's a very cool looking place, with a variety of rooms to cater to groups, couples or solo travelers including private rooms, dorms, bungalows and even camping by tent.  The staff is very friendly and the grounds are cleaned daily.  The overall set up of the Hostal really makes it a social and fun place to hang out, with a beautiful pool surrounded by palm trees, and a large reception area and bar.    Location:  It's a 2 minute walk to Carrizalillo Beach, which is the prettiest beach in"

20,"My husband and I spent four nights in Hostal Shalom and the toilets were just horrible!!! All of them really dirty, smelly and bad maintained!!! It was the worst moment of the day when we had to use the toilets and showers! Its a big hostel and they should take more care about the facilities!!! Besides we saw some cucarachas in the toilets. The room was ok but the ventilators didn't work properly! So it was incredibly hot inside. The hall is nice, staff was always friendly and the breakfast was really basic, but for the price it was ok. However it doesn't matter the price but it should be cleaned every day and we didn't see it!!!!! Definitely not recommended!!!"
50,"well my first time at Shalom was on '07 and the hostel has changed considerably...the swimming pool area has been renewed,reception and the camping area as well. i was camping during(semana santa) eastern long weekend for mexicans,everywhere was packed but very organized...the 12th anniversary party was great!! free drinks and live music all nite long. the afternoon receptionist was very cute and friendly,the receptionist of the night shift were super cute and friendly too...the morning one never smile...the owner is a super nice Lady! this hostel has a really good location near by Carrizalillo beach,restaurants and grocery stores...i think they need to find out how to keep dry the bathrooms floor. dont forget your slice of pizza and cerveza when you check in."
40,"The Hostel is super close to some of the prettiest beaches in puerto. I stayed with a big group and even though our room was a little dark , it was huge. The Pool area is great and as we happened to be there for the hostel's anniversary we enjoyed an awesome party with free drinks for every guest. The bathrooms need better maintenance though. The owner is a very nice woman who was glad to help us on anythyng we needed, even when when the transport service we hired to get back to mexico city arrived a day late and we had no money left to pay for a room of food. Nice place overall "
50,"If you are looking to live the whole Puerto Escondido experience, the real thing, you got it. This place is beautiful, you have nature, the comodities, a great & kind host and the beach to 4 blocks. It is safe, unexpensive, and you breathe surf, art and everything you wish to had in the city.  Casa Kei is the best option in puerto escondido."
50,"My stay at Casa Kei was excellent. The house is located in Brisas de Zicatela (really a cute neighbourhood where locals and tourists live in perfect harmony) You can walk to La Punta or Zicatela easily. The house has a rustic style yet very comfortable. There are hammocks and lounge chairs under fruit trees where you can kick back and relax. Usually there are other travelers in the house which I really enjoyed since I was traveling on my own. The garden is beautiful and the cats and parakeet are lovely.The owner will do whatever he can to make you feel at home, charismatic and friendly person willing to help with anything you need. Thanks Casa Kei for this unrepeatable experience."
50,"I stayed at Casa Kei for a week in June and Pepe made me feel immediately at home. I spent every morning drinking coffee in one of the yard's hammocks and enjoying the Casa's home-grown mangos. The rooms and facilities themselves are very clean and comfortable (the outdoor shower was my favourite - wash under the vegetation and a portrait of Frida Kahlo!) and the kitchen has all the pans and spices you could want to rustle up an evening meal. The area itself is quieter than the more touristy Puerto Escondido, it's cheaper, friendlier and feels closer to 'real Mexico'. Nonetheless, it's very cheap (about 10 pence) to catch the collectivo into town, and a real experience. Pepe is excellent at showing you around the area and recommending the best beaches, restaurants and shops. To"
50,"Casa Kei was my favourite place I stayed on my whole four-month trip through Latin America. I was there on my own and met lots of other great people travelling through, and Pepe was the best, most generous host - his fresh Coco Locos and Mojitos were amazing! His knowledge and love of the local area is unrivalled and because of this I had the best time in La Punta, partying and hanging out. It's a great place to base yourself for day trips to surrounding gorgeous beaches too, and you can certainly lose a few days just swinging in a hammock in the garden surrounded by mangos, art and wildlife. I also wanted to take the two ginger tabbies home with me. If you're a surfer, Pepe is totally your man, but even if not, there is more to him than the surf! I'll definitely be returning as"
50,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for a few days in May. We booked through Airbnb and decided to choose the room on the top floor. The room had a great view of the Pacific and the surrounding neighborhood, as well as a nice breeze to help cool us down. The bed was clean and the hammock was a nice bonus. Casa Kei itself is beautiful. The place is full of artwork, fruit trees, a nice shared kitchen, and a couple of very friendly cats. The atmosphere was perfect for getting lazy and hanging around in the crazy May heat. We probably spent more than half of our time in P.E. lounging in Casa Kei.  Pepe was a great host; very relaxed, friendly, and was happy to hang out with the guests. He made sure to fill us in on everything happening around the area and where to go for food/swimming."
50,"Pepe (the owner) was really helpful, providing tips as to the best restaurants to eat at, the cheapest and fastest mode of travel, and with arranging tours. We even joined him for his homemade breakfast on some occasions, drinks and night, and to surf. His friendliness ties in perfectly with the vibe in Casa Kei - really cool place for an authentic Puerto Escondido experience complemented by a sense of comfort and home at the same time. You'll have mango and banana trees surrounding you and lovely hammocks to rest on, including the incredible sound of the ocean when you sleep at night - it's that close to the beach, la punta! Easy access to the main beaches is also available and cheap via the collectivo."
50,"Casa Kei is a funky, artsy home with a myriad of colors, sounds, fragrances-- all that you would want from an authentic beach vacation with the conveniences of a luxury hotel. There are mosaics, flowers, paintings, fruits-- the space has lots of interesting character and flare! There is a semi-outdoor kitchen, a second story open space to practice yoga, meditation, pilates, an outdoor shower in addition to indoor showers, mango trees, hammocks-- whatever it is you may need, you can find it at Casa Kei. Located just 4/5 blocks from the beach, you can't find a better location than this one! Pepe is a lovely host and will help you find whatever it is you are looking for around Brisas de Zicatela or Puerto Escondido. He even helped me find the most economical way to travel from"
50,this place has a really great staff and you feel home instantly when you see it. Its clean and close to the sea. I went there with my boyfriend and it was so cute and romantic. You cook your own food in a lovely kitchen as well.
50,"Yes, you can find in this oasis of love a piece of paradise!! Staying here is like almost been home, except for the snow... :) Pepe -the host- makes you feel super welcomed, you can see how much love he puts in his house, garden, kitchen.. because its super clean everywhere. Even though its close to most of the facilities -restaurants, beach...-in la punta, most of us have a hard time to leave the house because we are too busy relaxing in a cozy hammock! Seriously, for a short or longer stay to puerto escondido, this is the place!!  "
50,"Beautiful spot, beautiful city, beautiful people! Overall incredible experience! Make sure to surf while you're there and try not to get lost. It's one of those places that gets harder and harder to leave :)"
50,"As a solo traveler, it can be intimating to pick a hostel that has friendly, happy people there to welcome you. All staff offered a family vibe right of the bat. They were never annoyed with questions or requests. All spoke English, which was so nice! A bit of a 'party' scene with the bar, so better for younger travelers. The location was ideal too, so close to swimming beaching and great restaurants. All around, A+!"
50,"This place was great, and the owner was very friendly as well. Rooms and bathrooms were clean, the only thing is no hot water to shower with, but the weather is hot so there was no need. The view from the top floor is very good at well. Recommended"
50,"I had booked 3 nights, just over christmas. But I ended up staying there til 5 of January then I was going home. Amazing vibe, the staff is lovely and met so many new friends and travelers! It’s like coming home, and you just can enjoy staying the whole day chilling at the pool or playing cards and having interesting talks with nice poeoe in there common areas. It’s clean and nice beds. Very quite at nighttime for them who needs to rest. Close to beaches! Playa Coral was my favorite, chill and very few people and just 15 minutes walk. Taxi is ridiculous cheap, so it’s easy to take that to like La Punta or Zicatela at night if you want party. I’m not even home yet, but already planning to come back soon as possible! "
50,"Cool hostel, a little bit of an older crowd on average compared to some other more partying hostels like Puerto Dreams. Good mix of people and located pretty close to one of the beaches. Would recommend"
50,"Nice hostel, clean and comfortable! Great healthy breakfast. Fun activities. Friendly  staff and kind friends! ❤️🇲🇽 nice kitchen spaces in every floor. Fans in the rooms, friendly dogs wandering around. Comfy lounges and a big clean pool! "
50,"My friends and I stayed at Bonobo for two nights and I wish we stayed for 2 weeks instead! This was my first ever hostel experience and it did not disappoint! Literally only a 4 minute walk away from one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen (it’s up there in my top 10 most gorgeous beaches). We were given complimentary welcome drinks upon arrival which made us feel right at home. The staff/ volunteers were so friendly and helpful in terms of giving advice on trips to go on, bars/ restaurants to go to and places to go and see during our stay. Free WiFi which was exceptionally good, breakfast included (yogurt, fruit and granola), lots of cute and friendly dogs to stroke and cuddle, amazing chalk boards decorated all around the hostel and a fan in every room (for each"
50,One of the best hostels I have stayed in. So friendly and relaxed. We all felt so welcome! Staff are amazing! Dogs are super cute. Breakfast is tasty.   The bar/pool area is cute and colourful. Female dorm was clean and spacious with loads of fans. There is also a kitchen on every floor so there is a lot of space to cook. Right near the beach too. Highly recommended! 
50,"Wohoo dude😁🏄 there is not much to say... This surf hostel is just an amazing spot to stay when in Puerto escondido. Staff is awesome open minded and always ready to help. You have tons of good deals while staying here, from burger, movie, cocktails night and so on.... We also loved the house dogs lucca, bonobo, coco and yuup we must not forget about occasionally local mezcal😁😂 For cooling off you have pool in just amazing chillout area.... Watch out for dachshund dog drink floaters floating in water to hold your drink while swimming 🍻😂 we give thumbs up for this place. 👍👍"
50,"Cool hostel. Nice welcoming staff, close to a bunch of beaches and restaurants. Shirt taxi to the clubs. Hostel is clean and tidy and here’s a good social vibe. Has a pool which is handy and there are 3 dogs :)"
40,"Friendly, good staff and the view from upstairs is amazing.  And if you want something the staff will help you with it.  Go to pepe's taco's the food over there is so good. The beach to learn how to surf or chill is close."
50,"I stayed at Frutas y Verduras for a week over new years and couldn't recommend this place more! Incredible location close to the beach, great people, nice chilled out vibe, it felt like home from the very beginning of my stay. The cafe is amazing with fresh, delicious food. I will 100% be back!"
50,"Ｉ'm totally satisfied with this place.This hotel is located at nearby beach. So I could go to surfing,and came back to eat lunch and went back to beach day by day for my stay there. I felt at easy like my home.this place is like that.there are many travelers also.  I want to refer that Food is very fresh& delicious at this place.I can see they use good vegetable& meat. I strongly recommend you to go there."
50,"The welcoming staff and attention to detail made our stay at Frutas and Verduras amazing.  The hostel is in La Punta, not right in Zicatela, which in our opinion is a huge plus. Zicatela has changed a lot over the past 10-20 years and La Punta has the laid back beach vibe that Zicatela used to have before it got crowded. You can't get any closer to the break at La Punta, which is the best surf in Puerto Escondido for intermediate surfers. Zicatela is a heavy, hollow break for advanced surfers only, and not recommended for swimmers.  It's a quiet little neighborhood, but less than a 10 minute taxi or colectivo ride to Zicatela if you want to try the heavier surf or feel like partying. The great part is that you can come back to your comfy bed and actually sleep soundly. The"
50,"Amazing surroundings and perfect place. Stay here and chill when the day is warmest and get back out on the waves when you have cooled down. Maybe with a drink from the great hotel cafe: Café Olé. It has cabanas for both 1 and 2 persons and rooms with space for more. Roof terrace, lookout tower, jacuzzi, hammocks. The bathrooms are shared but nice! You can cook your own food in a therefore existing kitchen. It is a fantastic place!"
20,"This place is not that good... it's nice but not very clean, right on the road... and you only have 2 showers and 2 toilets for the ALL hotel. The location is good, close to the beach, but you have a lot of cars and traffic just in front so..."
50,We had rented a cabana instead of a room which was actually a great experience! The rooms do have better fans but I would recommend any of their options. The restaurant and store are amazing serving veggie options and have great whole foods! The owners were super friendly and both nights we were there we had a few beers with the staff and other guests. Great place to meet chill nice people. Only downside would be location it is a bit far from Puerto Escondido and Playa zicatela.. At the same time though we ended preferring it because it was less crowded touristy and more surfer beach vibe! Oh and must try the restaurants near by___including lychee and the amazing pizza place Luna y sol in front
50,"I really enjoyed the relaxed environment of this hostel.  Located steps from La Punta and just down the beach from Zicatela, it's an ideal surfer lodging.  Howevever, the 30 peso cab ride to Carizarillo is worth it for those of us who want to chill under a palapa and swim.  The staff of both the cafe and the hostel are very helpful and friendly.  The little grocery that is connected to the hostel has farm fresh eggs you can cook up with veggies from the ""Mercado.""  If you are there on a Thursday night, ask if the French couple will be cooking that night and enjoy a wonderful meal!"
50,"I had an amazing time in this Hostel. Its location is perfect, few steps from the beach and the waves of la punta. If I wasn't surfing, I was hanging out in a hammock and enjoying the good vibes of this place. Everything you need is there, in the Cafe they have crepes, delicious coffee and sweets - there's also an organic grocery shop inside with things I haven't been able to find like Quinoa, Blue Cheese, Microbrewed beers and homemade bread. The staff is really cool and helped me find everything I needed in town. I definitely will be back!"
40,"Don't be put off the yards of dreads on display, or the slightly smug and beautiful guests, the staff are amazingly friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and well priced and and I'd return in an instant."
50,"We had 10 hrs in the air before we arrived in Mexico City to jump straight on a 14hr overnight bus to Puerto Escondido... Needless to say we were hoping we'd picked a good place to stay - after 5 great nights I think we picked the best! The hostel is new and kept very clean, there's lots of friendly staff and the hostel itself is very cool (if you stay here make sure you climb up the man made tower to check out the view of Zicatella beach - telescope provided.) we stayed in a private room, all of them have been painted and have a fan. The food at the hostel is delicious, all very fresh and healthy... Great if you need a break from the greasy enchilada (if not then there's a shop across the road that does Mexican.) The area itself was perfect for us, the south end of Zicatella"
50,"Elysium, Shangri-la, Nirvana, Heaven. Many words are used to describe a place or state of being where one sheds their concern for matters of consequence and achieve true bliss. Calling a trip to Gecko Rock a vacation is crass. It is an escape from your life and from even minor concerns. Here is a place where you can just relax.  Our meals were fantastic, and delivered without prompt. This was something totally new to us. We never worried about where to get our meals or even what to pick off of a menu. Mike and Aileen had our preference sheets and our trust in them was well deserved. Everything was delicious and the variety was exciting and made every meal a delight.  The resort is not overly opulent, but your room is a few steps from the pool and a few steps from where you'll"
50,"My boyfriend and I visited Gecko Rock in late May 2018 after spending a week in Puerto Escondido, about 45 mins north of the resort. The two areas are very different from one another, and we planned the trip so that we could be around a lot of people in the beginning, then finish up quietly at Gecko Rock. I don't think we could have planned it better! Spending time in a bigger town made us appreciate the serenity of Gecko Rock even more than we would have if we'd just stayed there during our entire trip.   Mike was a great and very conscientious host. He was preoccupied with making our stay relaxing and enjoyable. We had three terrific meals a day, and finished every night with outstanding cocktails. We loved playing Kubb, walking along the beach, and reading books from the"
50,"I had high expectations for this place before arriving for my honeymoon. My expectations were exceeded. It's beautiful, quiet and very relaxing. The constant sound of the ocean was so soothing. Walking down to the beach after breakfast and dinner did something wonderful to my life. Every meal was delicious! You can tell the owners take so much effort of make sure their guests are well taken care of and feel welcomed. The days consisted of eating great food, drinking cocktails, reading, swimming, flying my kite on the beach, talking with Mike, exploring, napping. It was like a dream. I look forward to doing it all again. If you're thinking about going, just go!"
50,"This was our second trip to Gecko Rock.  Mike helped us with our excursions and Aileen kept us well fed with her world class food.   We took many walks up and down the beach.  Always peaceful and restorative.  We walked to Agua Blanca several times and enjoyed cervezas, chips, and guacamole on the beach while watching the whales swim by and the local children playing futbal on the beach.  Absolutely amazing.   Mike hit it out of the park with our excursions.  We made our second trip in two years to La Ventanilla and got to see crocodiles, iguanas, and lots of birds.  A great excursion and a must see place.  We went to La Escobilla and watched the Olive Ridley turtles come ashore and lay their eggs.  Absolutely breathtaking.  A bucket list day for sure.   Mike booked us a “sea"
50,"So, i'm from an island in Brasil and it's always hard to compare other tropical places because I usually give more points to my city. But on this particular case, the Gecko Rock Resort made me choose this location to get more points than Brasil.  But don't think that i'm giving them more credits because they have more adventurous attractions, young people partying and loud music like we have in most of the beaches in Brasil.   It's the exact opposite that makes the place amazing. So if you are looking for a place to really relax, read a book, socialize with good heart people (like the Gecko owners), you must go there.  Best 5 days off my trip"
50,"My wife and I came for our honeymoon, and it was exactly what we wanted: secluded, pristine, relaxing, beautiful. You are far enough away from everything that you feel like you're the only people on earth (it helped we had the resort to our selves that week) but close enough to Puerto Escondido that if you want to go scuba diving, get a massage, eat some ceviche, shop, surf, you're a short cab ride away.   We spent most of our stay lying next to the pool, or sitting on the secluded beach; Mike and his wife took care of everything we wanted. In that way, Gecko Rock Resort felt more like an intimate bed and breakfast than a resort, which I tend to think of as large, commercial and impersonal.   The rooms are clean and comfortable. The property is beautiful. Mike is a great host. I"
50,"There are almost too many great things to say about Gecko Rock.  I'll start by saying that your stay at Gecko Rock is what you make it.  If you want to hideout and never leave... you can certainly do that.  If you want to walk the beach and eat at local restaurants you can do that...   If you want to see the sights and relax poolside in the afternoon... you can do that too.  Gecko Rock is a resort without hustle and bustle, its like a B&B with sunshine and ocean, its like being in the Mexican wilderness with all the comforts of beautiful resort.  We found it to be perfect for us.  I've eaten at Michelin star rated establishments and the food at Gecko Rock is every bit as good and far less pretentious.   We chose Gecko Rock for our wedding and Mike and Aileen made the day"
50,"My husband and I decided to spend the most important day of our lives with Gecko Rock and I can honestly say this was the best decision ever! I have never had better service from a resort big or small. The owners are very attentive to detail, the resort feels exotic, exclusive and private and the food was exquisite. I’m pretty picky when it comes to customer service and this place was exceptional in every way. From the help with travel arrangements to and from our outside excursions like whale and dolphin watching to the extreme amount of care that went into making our wedding day perfect, I have absolutely nothing but positive things to share about our stay. If you are looking for a truly memorable and unque wedding destination or honeymoon that is picture perfect, this is the"
50,"I'm not a large resort person or a resort person at all so I was looking for an off the beaten track place in Mexico and I found Gecko Rock. At the end of a bumpy dirt road lies this green,tranquil oasis. The resort is beautiful. There are hammocks to hang out in and the one's on the rooftops are handmade and feel like a comfy smooth towel. You'll spend a lot of time under the palapa as that is where the food and drinks are served. It's perfect for an afternoon nap. At night, the geckos come out and provide entertainment! The food is fantastic and served by the ever sociable Mike. Mike and Aileen have lots of pets and you'll hear Prime Time barking greetings to whoever passes by. The weather does get warm so a dip in the pool is a wonderful way to cool off.  The nearby beach is"
50,"My wife and I stayed at this lovely resort from January 25 - February 1, 2018.  It was a week of pure rest (we were spoiled and had the resort to ourselves).  Everything you'll read in the other reviews hold true - Aileen's fantastic food, Mike's great help and service, and fun conversation, pure peace and quiet, and catering things to your own preferences (doing as much or as little as you'd like).  One of my favourite things to do was sit in a hammock on the rooftop area and look at the stars.  The ocean nearby is a bit rough, but not too far down (heading to the left) there's an area you can be in that's safer.  The rougher water made from some great background noise though.  We had the beach area we walked to (off to the right) completely to ourselves when we went, with"
50,"Chris, the friendly Aussie owner, made my stay very pleasant. He picked me up at the airport and even gave me a ride for my early morning flight back to Oaxaca.  They have 15-20 reasonably priced rooms surrounding a nice pool. My room had a fan, which made the difference in the PE heat. And it's very quiet, too.   In the evenings, people gather near the pool to hang out and chat. I met some very nice people and it really made the stay special. They have a fridge and a stove for cooking, so get some food from the grocery store if you don't want to eat out every night.  One note: it is a bit of a distance from town. To get to town or the other beaches, you need to walk to the highway and flag down a collectivo (5 pesos) for a 5 or 10 minute ride. You can take a collectivo or a cab"
50,"Ive never written a review before, but after staying there I felt compelled to. It is a new hotel, with a beautiful view of Escondido. The owner Chris, is one of the nicest, most helpful men I have ever met. Everyone there is laid back and friendly, and Chris is so welcoming. You really feel like your at home, and not on some prissy resort. In all my years of travelling the world, this hotel has impressed me the most! Im too lazy to include photos but you can check the place out for your self at  www.puertosunset.com  Tell Chris Megan sent you! :)"

Very quiet and tranquille place to visit   except for the guy in #3  who drank an awfull lot of BEER    which was cheap there and the food Great...  I will be back to this wonderful Resort.   love you guys and miss you      Mickey from New Westminster BC Canada"
50,"Sunset Point, run by Australian Chris Rex and his wife Rosela, is one of the best places to stay in Puerto Escondido.   A veteran traveler to Puerto, I have stayed in many places here, and this one is topnotch in offering great value.    The hotel sits high over the ocean at La Punta and offers stupendous views of both the entire beachfront and the mountains surrounding Puerto.      Sunset offers choices of rooms, apartments, bungalows and villa, at good prices.   I stayed in the Villa and later, in the penthouse apt.  Both were extremely attractive.  The penthouse is a huge room with its own terrace-kitchen, with bright yellow walls (painted with natural dyes made from tree bark) and high enormous windows overlooking the ocean.     The bed is brandnew and comfortable and"
50,"After searching high and low for a place in Puerto Escondido, we came across this hidden treasure on a Vacation Rental By Owner web site.  After a quick peek at their website and a few email correspondences, we booked one of the bungalows for our three and a half weeks in Puerto.  Rosella and her daughter were there waiting for us at the airport (which was awesome because we were traveling with our one year old son) when we arrived and gave us a quick introduction to town on the ride back to La Punta.  The hotel is off the beaten track, which is great because the main beach is over-run with tourist type fare.  La Punta is the quiet end of the beach, but still has some restaurants and bars.  The surfing on this end is more manageable and doesn't have quite the severe currents and"
50,"I will start with the fascinating pool - 25 meters of pure pleasure in a magical surrounding of flowers, hammocks and a tranquil palappa hangout. It is placed in the yard of 6 spacy rooms each with bathroom, fan, a wardrobe, a cosy and clean bed as well as a private little terrace furnished with a hammock, a table, a fridge and a small kitchen which invites couples as well as small groups to hang out and enjoy the fantastic view on the ocean and the town of Puerto Escondido. More private and luxury rooms are available with Air Condition, TV and some more special features. The hotel owned Restaurant is currently self catering which was very much in our interest .. We had large BBQ with Fish and Ribs and of course some shots of Mezcal and some loong nights playing cards and Jenga"

Thanks Chris and crew for a wicked stay, plus all the other guests I met during my time there, I'm gonna miss you guys.  If your reading this and thinking about the Pacific Coast Sunset Point is Mucho cool. Surfing is top priority followed by doing nothing but pool 'n' beach. Big Library and hammock selection. I did manage some Spanish lessons though. Don't miss the BBQ nights....."
50,"Our hosts, Chris and hid friendly staff, were superb. He supplied us with information of all the best beaches, restaurant and bars. With the biggest pool in Puerto Escondido on you doorstep its a great place to chill out the whole day or when u get back from the beach (witch is 10 minutes walk)."
40,"Un lugar que tienes amplia habitación con aire acondicionado, televisión básica con 4 canales, le falta mantenimiento al baño pero esta funcional. Pequeña alberca,  será de la playa como a 10 min. Y muy amable el señor que está en recepción, siempre cordial y para orientarse.  Recomendado."
40,"Das Hotelzimmer war nicht besonders nobel, aber sauber und absolut ausreichend. Es gab zwei saubere Doppelbetten, einen Ventilator und ein kleines Bad mit Dusche. Für 250,- Pesos pro Nacht für zwei Personen war das wirklich gut! Die Gläser wurden nicht abgewaschen. Die Lage war in Ordnung, ca. 5-10min vom Strand entfernt, den Hügel rauf. Zwischen Hotel und Strand gab es viele Läden, Supermarkt und Busbahnhof waren auch nur ein paar Minuten entfernt. Portier war sehr nett, wir konnten auch nach dem Auschecken unser Gepäck hinter der Rezeption lassen und es am Abend abholen.  Der Pool war klein aber fein. Man konnte nicht mit kaltem Wasser duschen, da es wohl im ganzen Ort kein richtig kaltes Wasser gab (das Meer war auch warm)."
40,"I have stayed here twice and for 200 pesos single per night I can't complain.  I like the location at four blocks from the Adoquin, and four blocks from the high way.  A bank and a laundry are across the street.  The rooms are basic, but roomy and functional.  The hotel is secure and you leave the key at the front desk when ever you leave.  It is on Perez Gasga along with several other small hotels, stores, and shops.  Not as many tourists on this side."
40,"We stayed in this hotel for 1 night in February. We checked some other hotels before and this option was the best. The location is perfect between center and Zacatella beach (surfers paradise). Rooms are big and clean, shower is perfect!"
50,"Very nice rooms.  Right on the ""surfing"" beach in PE but safe enough for a dip.  Lunch on the beach or at the restaurant overlooking it.  About a 20 minute walk into the center of PE.  Beautiful pool."
50,"We stayed at the Santa Fe during the low season and, as they were running a special offer for their 25th birthday, we decided to ""splurge"" on a Junior Suite.  Location is fantastic, just across the road from the main beach. The room was very large, light and airy, pleasantly decorated and very clean. Although the room had aircon, we opted to use the ceiling fans instead, as they did a better job at keeping the mosquitoes at bay. Only disappointment is that it didn't have a view to speak of, just a back street. Sea-view suites are available, of course.  The hotel pool is very nice, but with a beautiful beach just across the road, who cares? We ate at the restaurant one night and the food is very nice (non-veg options available) and the atmosphere is breezy and romantic. I would"

We ate every breakfast here and some dinners, it was all delicious. Loved the Pico de gallo (spelling?) We have travelled all over Mexico and many other parts of the world and this was definately one of the more charming hotels. Puerto Escondido has a great long beach and lots of good restaurants.  A great place to relax and enjoy the sun. Its Hot!"

We really loved this hotel; the rooms were very nice ( colonial style), we liked the food ( although we also ate a few times in one of adjacente beach restaurants), service was excellent ( wifi - internet was working fine), we loved the pools - they weren't very busy, probably because the beach is so inviting.  Puerto Escondido is a fine location to make some daytrips; we visited Puerto Angel and Puerto Augustinillo. we loved Puerto E and the hotel Santa Fe so much we returned there on returntrip to Mexico City"
40,"This is by far the best hotel in PE and the food at the hotel is above average.  We stayed at the busiest time of the year which is always a true test of service and their service was definitely tested.  Pros: Candido the manager is very helpful and trustworthy. This hotel is very safe. The cleaning staff was above average. Great location and we enjoyed the onsite yoga, Erika the instructor was a gem and helped us w/much of our planning on places to go and see.   Cons: There is an adult pool that clearly states (in many languages) that there are no children allowed. However, it seemed like the rule only applied to Americans. At times there were SCREAMING annoying children and infants in the pool. We complained to the desk about 4 times in one day  along w/other guests and they"
30,"HOTEL REVIEW # 156 Hotel Santa Fe, Puerto Escondido  MY TRAVEL STYLE: If possible, I try to stay away from business hotels and strongly prefer resorts that resemble the Four Seasons, Aman, and Oberoi but try to find similar properties at lower cost. I seek out the “wow” experiences and I encourage you to view hotels I have stayed at and their respective reviews (by clicking on my name).  LOCATION:  On the best part of PE with all the shops and restaurants right out front of the hotel.  There is a street in front of the hotel (like all hotels in this part of PE).  BEST WAY TO GET THERE:  Hotel has a $25USD private car pick up from the airport.  We took a collectivo for $3 per person that made one 2 minute stop on the way.  Taxis back to the airport cost 50 pesos.  TYPE OF ROOM:"
40,"we arrived in PE (I think i may have been prior to 2003) with reservations at another ""complex"" and found the Santa Fe.  WE loved it, stayed a week.  We took a few days and a short flight to Oaxaca and the santa Fe safely kept our bags , picked us up at the airport and then upgraded us to a finer room.  We can say nothing but... EXCELLENT!  This includes the food.  we also had the pleasure of meeting a resident of the B&B named Arlene G.......(?) Could she still be loving her life at the Santa Fe?  Due to Health issues we have not returned but when the day comes so will we! Thank you for all of your hard work in making your establishment as wonderful as it is."
40,"I had a most enjoyable stay for several days at the Santa Fe in May 2008. The low season room rate represented excellent value. The room was spacious and spotless, the grounds of the hotel were lush and well-maintained. The hotel was quiet whilst I was there; I don't know what the atmosphere might be like at busier times, but I found it delightful as I was looking to decompress and relax. The staff were all very gracious and pleasant to deal with. I look forward to returning to the Santa Fe the next time that I venture to Oaxaca."
50,"We have been staying at the hotel Santa Fe for the last 8 years and intend to return againa nd again. We just got home and are already looking forward to our return trip.  The walks on the beach are wonderful, the fishing is great, the service at the hotel is always the best. The food (vegetarian and fish) is well prepared and resonably priced. The rooms are clean and spacious. Both the lap pool and the regular pool are cleaned every morning and the are gracious and helpful. The rooms are large spacious. They are also equipped with a safe for the use of the guests. The hotel offers on day trips. As an overall rating, we would rate this as one of the best trips we have taken and will return. BOB AND CHARLOTTE CARON caroncharlotte@comcast.net"
50,"We have visited Hotel Santa Fe each July and August for the past ten years. Actually we work with this Hotel because we are an ecological tour operator company, and we run trips every summer to Puerto Escondido. The experienced staff has always been friendly and eager to please. They are the best people you can find in any Hotel. Also because the rooms are bright, clean, and comfortable. the hotel resaurant is first class. We especially like the location and the wonderful ocean view, and the proximity to the beach. Shopping and restaurants are within easy walking diatance. Santa Fe, while reasonably priced. I´m sure is the best option in Puerto. And all our clients sent us every year excellent comments about this beautiful and comfortable Hotel. We will be back again next summer."
50,"I had the good fortune to stay for 6 nights and it was wonderful ! The room and gardens were beautiful and very relaxing! The staff were some of the nicest people I have ever met in my life! (Really) Stores, restaurants and beaches all close by. An excellent choice!"
50,"I stayed at Puerto Surf for 10 nights and it was the best decision! The staff is amazingly friendly, always there for you, very chill about almost everything and the house is soooo chill as well, you almost forget about the mosquitoes haha! It’s really beautiful, straight at the beach (like 50m) and the surf lessons are so much fun as well. One instructor has maximum 2 students, so you will get back exhausted but hyped as well after the lesson (and go for breakfast at Café Ole)! I would definitely go there again in the future!!! Do it, you won’t regret it 🤞🏽"
50,"Me and my girlfriend spent three weeks here (it was only supposed to be one!) and had an amazing time. The surf lessons are great, the accommodation is great and the price is very fair in comparison to other options in Puerto. La Punta is also the best spot to be in the town...it is quiet and cool but also had plenty of good places to eat and enjoy a drink. Highly recommended!"
50,"I just came back from Puerto Escondido and I most certainly enjoyed my time in Puerto Surf! Friendly staff, cozy atmosphere and just a few steps from the beach! Our surfing lesson was also great, it was a our first time doing it and instructors were so patient "
50,"I travelled to Puerto Escondido alone and am so thankful to have found Puerto Surf. I had such a great time and the instructors were so helpful and fun to hang out with that I ended up surfing everyday of my trip. My instructor was Miam, but all of the instructors were great. I didn't stay in the lodging, although I wish I had. They are located in La Punta, which in my opinion would be the best place to stay. I would highly reccomend Puerto Surf to anyone looking to have a great time!"
50,"Ok, so let me first say I feel guilty for not writing this review sooner.  Sorry about that, David.  My family and I stayed here last month for a couple of weeks for surfing lessons and it was wonderful in all ways possible.  We stayed in the top floor (I think it was Room #5) with the private roof deck and seriously, it was amazing.  Our travel partner stayed in Room #4 which was equally as dramatic but most of the time we hung out in our room as it was spacious and airy.  There are plenty of outdoor public spaces spread around the property that lend themselves nicely to conversation and hanging out.  We left a Ludo game at the house so go ahead and enjoy some board games. :)  The surfing classes were great for my family and almost everyone was able to stand up by the end of"
50,"Stayed here for 3 nights, walking distance to the beach. Everyone is so nice and accommodating. Plenty of tips of where to go in the area and things to do.   The rooms are spotless and clean. Everything works, wifi, fan etc! Super close to the surf break for beginners. If you're looking for a more advanced break, stay in Zicatel.   They even let me store my board bag while I went to Mazunte for a day, free of charge, so nice. When I return I will definitely stay again."
40,"Had a good stay here, it's a fantastic location if you're looking to surf La Punta.  The property itself is pretty basic, clean rooms, good showers/bathrooms, and nicely decorated but don't expect any real amenities.  It definitely gets hot at night with no A/C so keep that in mind...  As for the local break, they are very territorial there if you're not paying for a surf lesson.  This isn't a Puerto Surf problem, more of a problem with La Punta itself...the instructors there won't hesitate to push one of their students onto a wave while you're riding.  I guess they realize at the end of the day the students pay/tip them and they have nothing to gain by observing etiquette for foreign surfers there on their own."
50,"Massive thanks to Kim, Alejandro and all the Puerto Surf instructors! Lovely people and very professional. Rooms are all very spacious and clean, and the garden is a great space to relax with plenty of hammocks.  Can't recommend Puerto Surf enough, thank you!"
50,"I can't say enough good things about Puerto Surf House. The house and rooms are amazingly beautiful, making it the perfect place to rest. The garden is gorgeous and has hammocks to chill, there is a small kitchen where you can prep some food. The surf instructors are not only very friendly but also professional and will help you get in the waves safely. Overall if what you want is to rest while learning some surfing, I would definitely recommend staying at Puerto Surf. Zicatela and especially La Punta is a delightful area for a cool holiday. Thank you guys, Thomas"
50,"Traveled with a friend, can’t say enough about this place! As two women we felt perfectly safe. Perfect location, walk to beach, insane sunsets, amazing food nearby, clean and comfortable rooms. Everyone was so kind and accommodating. We got in really early so they let us stash our stuff in their office and take surf boards to the beach. They set up massage, recommended great food, always smiling. But the highlight was Jesus, our surf instructor. He was full of joy, great instructor, and kept it fun and safe. Can’t wait to go back!"
50,"Wherever you come from, you will find a place to be relaxed and comfortable in la Casa Kei.  Everything, from the beautiful garden to the bedrooms is made to please your eyes as you walk through the house. The sun light makes it even more interesting, changing the mood as the day goes. Pepe is a great host taking care of all your needs and becomes your friend. He loves the place and will share that love with you.  La Casa Kei is very close to local stands and the beach with the best surfing spot! Enjoy the best of Puerto Escondido here!"
50,"The host Pepe is welcoming and warm person. The property has a really nice garden with hammocks, outdoor kitchen, it is well maintained and had a good atmosphere. All the rooms are super nice and clean, couple of them have outstanding views of ocean, sunset and stars!"
50,"Super cozy, cute and colourful. Pepe is really nice and goes out of his way to make you feel at home.   It is just a few blocks from the beach. If you want to experience staying in Puerto like a local, this is your place."
50,"I was volunteering at Casa Kei for few weeks. Pepe is such a nice guy, people who staying there is awesome! Everyone has really good energy. Best point is the garden! Peaceful, chill, just nice. If you are young could or solo traveler love to talk tones people, you must love here!"
50,"Casa kei.. Where to start? So many good things to say about this place! Pepe is a fantastic host, kind caring and sharing. Guests very soon become great friends.The garden at casa kei is beautiful, well kept and very relaxing. The location of the house is great too, 5 minute walk to the beach and all local amenities. It is also very convent for public transport to the  main town. Anything you need to know about the area Pepe is happy to help you with. I was lucky enough to stay at casa kei for several weeks volunteering my painting skills in exchange for my stay and it was a fantastic experience. Highly recommend casa kei as with out a doubt, the best place to stay in the area"
50,"Casa Kei is a great place to relax with chill beach vibe. The garden of beautiful and Pepe is a fantastic host! The house is a short walk from the beach, cafes and restaurants. It's definitely worth a stay!"
50,"Pepe has a fabulous place. The vibe is easy-going and fun, the garden is gorgeous, the rooms are unique (his place is like a treehouse! all your childhood fantasies will be fulfilled. ;) ) and the view from the top room is sublime (why hello there, pacific ocean).   And Pepe is kind of awesome. He makes the best mojitos. And delicious tlayudas. And his coffee is just about perfect.   It's a quick jaunt down to the beach. You pass the tamale lady and the quesadilla lady on the way, so in my opinion, the location couldn't be better.   go here. You'll be so many different kinds of happy that you did."
50,"Our two weeks at Casa Kei was unforgettable. 5 blocks from the beach, I spent most mornings with the sunrise. Casa Kei has the perfect ambiance for some relaxation time in the shade when the afternoon sun is just too hot to bare. Moments from convenient stores and restaurants, there is never nothing to explore. I love the quietness around La Punta (where Casa Kei is located) at night, but nightlife is just a 20 minute walk down the beach or less than a 5 minute taxi ride away.  We were fortunate enough to get to stay in two different rooms during our stay here, and I must say I truly loved the top floor room - with a hammock over the bed, it really is the best place to kick back, read a book, and feel a lovely cool breeze on a hot afternoon.   I highly recommend Casa Kei to"
50,"We came to Casa Kei because of it's close proximity to a great surfing beach. We have continued to stay because Pepe, the owner, is very hospitable and fun. The location is better than we hoped: it is more beautiful than we could have ever imagined. The guesthouse has been great to meet new people, but it is still small enough that it is quiet, intimate, and peaceful. We've enjoyed dinners and drinks in the evenings with other guests from various nationalities. We're right down the street from the world's greatest homemade tortillas and enchiladas. We love it so much, we still don't have an exit date set. We're positive you'll love it, too!"
50,"Casa Kei is a beautiful little Hostel. I spent about ten nights there and it didn't take long til it felt like home. The garden is wonderful and you have an excelent view on the beach from the rooms. Wherever you look there is a little piece of art, that is because Pepe has volunteers from time to time that decorate the place. Pepe is a great BBQer and I am still dreaming about the fish we had that one night. I can only recommend  a stay in Casa Kei. You'll have a good time!"
50,"Three couples traveled to Puerto Escondido and stayed on Playa Zicatela at this hotel! It was amazing. Out of the six of us we did not have one complaint! Marco seems to be the manager of a family run business and it is very relaxed and well priced! The rooms are spacious and very clean! We had an oceanfront with jacuzzi tub on our balcony it was great! The pool and grounds are well kept and breakfast was included and delicious! My husband got stung by a stingray in the water and the hotel has a doctor on sight and the front desk will send out for your prescriptions. They are very accommodating, we are all planning our return trip for next year!"
10,"I have seen many hostels all over the world and I know how hostels are and that they are not the cleanest places but the price is what counts, right?! However, I was in the Shalom in low season, the girl at the reception apparently just came out of hiberation and there were not many human guests present. I had a cockroach sitting in my bed and a scorpion under my backpack the next morning. The crap in the corner didnt even bother me... through the thunderstorm at night, we had puddles all over the room the next morning (beside the fact that water was leaking from the sink as well).  I stayed in hostels for the same or a better price and slept way better and only the fact that one can reach a beach in walking distance would not make me stay there again; Zicatela is on the other"
40,"Nice hostel with main building and some bungalows, also camping available I think. All clean. They have a swimming pool, but no one's using it, as it's 200 meters to a great beach called Carrizalillo (but long stairs to come back after swimming). It's ideal if you'd like to swim or try some surfing: the guys from the 'yellow tower' give surf lessons and are always there to chat. The waves are good for beginners: there are some, but not as big as the ""Mexican Pipeline"" on big beach Zicatela.  Walking distance to city center and market, places like La Punta are quite far, but colectivo taxis are cheap.  From the staff there was one very friendly girl and some rather rude/bored people.  Unfortunately no internet/breakfast included. But rates are cheap, I paid 100 Peso/night for a"
30,"Ninguna queja, hotel con lo necesario para una agradable estadía y con buena ubicación. Mi habitación contaba con aire acondicionado, ventilador, televisor, baño propio y amenidades como agua, jabón y shampoo. Solo estuve una noche así que no puedo opinar mucho más."
40,"Para estancias cortas excelente, es cómodo, accesible. Estuve solo dos noches pero me encanto el trato, es un hotel céntrico, cerca de la playa, los servicios son relativamente económicos en los lugares cercanos, por ejemplo comidas, bebidas, etc. Comí en un restaurante cercano que no me agrado el sabor y aparte no tenia facturas que se llama zona T o algo así, por lo que no lo recomiendo."
50,"Solo he ido a Oaxaca una vez. Me alojé en un hotel maravilloso, ""Las Gaviotas"". Es un hotel sencillo, con habitaciones completas, amplias, comodas y muy limpias, quiza algo austeras.  Tiene un patio interior, totalmente lleno de plantas muy bien cuidadas. Sirven unos desayunos absolutamente magnificos, y el dueño es un señor encantador.  Lo recomiendo totalmente, si volviera a Oaxaca (cosa que estoy deseando) me alojaria en este hotel."
50,"in the USA you couldn't touch these guard gated private condos and houses for $100 per night.  In off season, you can rent a two bedroom condo here for that.  in July, it was $150 per night for 2 bedroom 2 bathroom condo.  all of them are privately owned and priced differently.  google Las Gaviotas vacation rentals and you'll see all the ones there are available for rent.  I highly recommend this place. took the whole family. kids loved it.  nice beach, surfing, pool, tennis courts.  beautiful ocean views. "
50,"For sure the best hostel in Puerto Escondido. Its just 3 steps from the beach and you can hear the waves all night...so relaxing! If you want to escape reality, the tower is the best place to chill and feel like you are alone in the world. The hostel is spotless clean and the owners super friendly. I stayed for a month and felt like at home. The food at the bar is sooo delicious, I have never tried such tasty pancakes before! Internet is very important for me and it worked without problems all the time, thats also a big plus. The place is gorgeous!"
40,"The food at rhat place is really great, we had breakfast there every single day. Great smoothies, nice People, really relaxed Atmosphere. the place is gorgeous, and we loved the environment and the hippie lile feeling. I ll be back. "
40,"Had an awesome time here. Stayed for 5 nights but easily could have stayed for longer. There are plenty of areas for just lazing around & they have a bar with awesome food. The room was basic but what you expect for the price & the wifi worked the majority of the time. The location is awesome literally a 20metre walk and you are on the beach at La Punta & the views from the viewing platform are amazing! The rooms can get pretty hot at night but the fans worked well. My only criticism would be that there was only one male & one female toilet & shower, & they were right next to the kitchen so there was very limited privacy but apart from that it was great. The price is also fantasic as well :-)  Cabs are aways around so its easy to get to Zicatela if you need to. I would"
50,"This was my first trip to Mexico and I was excited to find such a great hostel.  The rooms are large, clean and comfortable - the vibe is mellow and inviting - and the food is healthy and fresh.  You're so close to the surf break la punta, and you can see how the waves/crowds are from a tower built on the property.  There's tons of hammocks to lounge on, and hot tub and sunning area, cool books in the library, and cool ex-pats and locals hanging around the bar.  I totally recommend this hostel if you want to surf your brains out and be in a nice quiet zone to rest up for the next days waves.  It's like a mix between a B+B and a hostel since you can order all the food you want - or cook for yourself if you prefer.  Can't wait to come back :)"
50,"I originally came to Frutas to have lunch in their cafe and hop on wifi. I was so impressed that I ended up cancelling another hostels reservation and staying there instead.  My decision was perfect. After I few days I realized this is where the cool kids hang this place keeps a great atmosphere of visitors and locals and the food in their in house cafe is so good you'll end up eating there more than any other place around. I suggest the banana Nutella crepe and one of their fresh fruit juices.  The owners invested a lot of energy and it shows. If it wasn't for the lack of private bathrooms I'd call this place a resort; everything here is extremely well done (and clean), from the soft and colorful bed sheets to the original artwork on the walls. The terrace is beautiful with a"
50,"I didn't stay at Casa de Olas, but I would go there for yoga classes lead by Charlotte. Wonderful class, and complimented my stiffness and aches for surfing poorly and other exercises, but that only formed part of the experience. On Sundays there were two classes back to back, followed by an excellent breakfast, and hanging out by the pool. I made most of my Puerto friends on these social and healthy Sundays."
40,"The hotel has an excellent location, just across the road from the Zicatella beach. Rooms are tiny and not super-modern or comfortable, but sufficient and clean (especially considering the price). Very nice and helpful staff, although it really helps to know some Spanish - English doesn't work much. If you require a room with a view, try to see it first - some rooms are facing the inner yard. Our room had air-conditioning, but if you decide not to use it/to use only the fan, the room gets burning hot in the afternoon."
10,Horrible place with rude staff. My booking was a room with private balcony and they gave me another room completly different. As I complaint the reception lady ( Amelia ) became very rude and agressive as her mistake was my fault. Nothing they amounce you can trust. They charge me taxes for 4 days but I stayed there for only 2. Go somewhere else as Zicatela beach is full of good places to stay.
40," Hotel las olas is really Nice, i stayed in the 8 bem room (Hostel style) and everything was good! Really Nice staff and really Nice Location for a really cheap price.   The only bad thing was that it didn't included a common kitchen or so, but the food out in the nearby restaurants is cheap and quiet good.   (I went to Zicatela beach to surf)"
20,"First thing, the location of this hotel is great! We got the room with balcony but the room was located inside the complex, so basically, the view from our balcony was the back of another building. That was OK with us. The balcony did make the room better as it provided us with some open space and a place to dry bathing suits. However, the design of the room was weird. The sink was outside the bathroom in a corner in the room. The worst part was the bathroom. The light was very dim. Toilet flush was very very weak and the shower was nothing more than a trickle. At a beach town, for me, it's very important to have a good shower in the room as I need to wash the ocean off my hair and body frequently. Then to top this, no floor mat was provided and they had one of those types of"
10,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights. The staff seemed nice enough and helpful, although none of them speak English so sometimes communication was a challenge. They have a small but nice pool.  Other guests who had been there longer than us told us that it could get very noisy at times because of the location on the main strip, but the three nights that we were there were fairly quiet.  Our room was on the bottom floor towards the back of the complex, which is a quieter location. Unfortunately, the room was very small and cave-like. We had hoped that it might be one of the cooler rooms, but we found that it was still quite hot and humid. We decided to pay the extra 200 pesos a night for the air-conditioner.  I was dismayed to find that a staff member comes to the room"
40,"Lovely location right on the front overlooking the beach.  We had a large, bright  room on the 3 rd floor with a balcony. Very clean, fresh towels every day. Plenty of warm water. There is a pool but no one seems to use it , but why would you with the beach so close?  We would stay there again"
50,"Talavera ceramic accents, fridge, A/C, roomy. Laundry and grocery store nearby Views...awesome location. A bargain for the rate charged. Staff was helpful with suggestions and questions. What more can one ask for!"
40,"We stayed at Las Olas for 2 nights in early February. Our room was in the back, but comfortable enough and clean.  Because of its location, there wasn't through airflow so we did need the air-con even in February.  The hotel was secure and was located close to the beach, restaurants and shopping. The owner helped us with where to make an international call and let us store our bags until our night bus. We would stay there again."
50,"The cabanas are too cute and each with their own porch and hammock.  I could hear the ebb and flow of the surf as I slept.  Each morning I would arise and walk the 40 steps to the beach where I enjoyed an inexpensive breakfast at one of the many beach restaurants.  Next, I would relax in one of the many lounge chairs or swinging beds near the surf and enjoy the warm ocean all day.  The proximity to the beach and the price of the accommodations can not be beat!  The staff is fantastic.  Manuel discovered that I liked coconuts so he found one from a tree on the premises and cut it open just for me.  The grounds and the rooms are also very clean.  The owner is bilingual and has been with the hotel since it was built.  I highly recommend Puerto Escondito as a vacation destination"
50,I had an amazing time in Bonobo. The stuff is super friendly they even are helping me to sell my surfboard after I left bonobo.  I would recomend this place to all solo travellers because it feels loke a big family there
50,The staff and facilities at Bonobo Surf House are fantastic. Did not have any problems and the sense of security and cleanliness is great. Such a welcoming group of people with excellent level of both English and Spanish (and other languages depending on who is working). Breakfast is healthy and delicious. Super close to Playa Carizalillo and a main food area. Definitely will book again to stay here when next in PE.
50,"We enjoyed 5 nights here at Bonobo. During our Mexico trip it was a super place to calm down and relax. Nice, clean Hostel with friendly and helpful people/staff! All swimming beaches are nearby (5 min walk to playa carrizalillo) Thanks Darlings! "
50,"Hang out poolside with the dogs Nuka y Bonobo in a beautiful atmosphere. Treat yourself to their special amaretto sour from the bar then cruise on over to the beach, approx. a 3 minute walk. Great owner and wonderful vibes. Will be back. Thank you for your hospitality."
50,"bonobo is run by very welcoming, knowledgable super fun people. the pool and bar are great to hang about in. it's located in a nice area with beaches and restaurants close walking distance. it's very clean and comfortable. I can't say a bad thing about this place. xx"
50,"I stayed at Bonobo’s surfhouse for 10 days and can’t say anything bad about this place! It’s super clean, great location and the people are amazing! It has a nice pool and a cheap bar with great cocktails and deals! The entire stuff team was always friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place to everyone who is traveling alone or with friends! Would definitely come back any time!"
50,"I've stayed in this hostel about one month and loved it! Alicia the owner and her stuff are all super nice and helpful. The building itself and all the floors are beautiful and well decorated, every floor has its own full equipped kitchen. The pool and the bar in the common area are very nice and great to have. The rooftop palapa bar has a beautiful view and is an awesome place to watch the incredible sunsets in Puerto Escondido. The cleaning lady does a really good job, the bathrooms and rooms are always clean. Bonobo surf house is located in a nice area of Puerto Escondido. You have many restaurants and a little store only a one to five minute walk away. Beautiful beaches are also in walking distance. I had a spacious private room with two comfortable beds with good mattresses"
50,"Bonobo its a great hostal located near Carrizalillo beach, and the Benito Juárez blv, in which there are plenty options to eat, the staff is great and the mattresses where very comfortable (something I really appreciate) the rooftop has a great view, and a very cute bar where you can relax and enjoy the sunset"
40,"My friend and I stayed here for three nights at the end of our week long trip in Oaxaca. It is located only two blocks from Avenida Benito Juarez and Playa de Carrizalillo, a small but tranquil beach perfect for relaxing and swimming away from the hustle of the main beaches.  Bonobo had someone working the front desk, which is in an open courtyard where they have a bar, a lounging area, and a pool, from the moment we got there around 8am and they allowed us to check in early. We had a two bed room with a shared bathroom that was very clean and rarely used by anyone else on our floor.  Each floor has its own common area and the roof has a great chillout spot with hammocks, another little bar, and open space where they do yoga sometimes.   Bonobo is managed by Alice a German woman"
50,"Hi, we stayed in a couple of place in Puerto Escondido and this was by far the best. The lady who runs it is amazingly helpful. She is very honest, and has lived in Puerto for 30 years so know the place inside out. I stayed in the top apartment which has pretty much the best view in town and was our favourite place for evening sundowners. My friends stayed in the apartments lower down, all of which are super clean, and have choice of air con or fan. Many of the rooms have kitchenette, and I would highly recommend one of those. If you do not get the top apartment ask for the apartment with the wrap around balcony and kitchenette outside. If you are staying in Puerto I cannot recommend this place highly enough."
10,"We were anticipating our much-needed vacation, and especially going back to the Buena Vista, which we discovered 2 years ago (I wrote a dithyrambic review at the time). The large room at the top, with 120 steps to climb to get to, and its still comfortable king bed and large terrasse, we were happy to occupy again.  The bathroom was in need to TLC, the kitchen also, but we're here for the view, right? So the first 2 nights, no problemo.  On Monday, hell begins!  The owner is having a laundry room build, right next to our terrasse.  Monday to Friday, all day, until very late at night, cement making, wood board cutting, hammering, welding noises.  By late at night, I mean 1 a.m., 3 a.m. and finally, all night long on the Friday. Why did we stay one week?  We booked two weeks, the"
10,"There are two reasons I recommend staying away from this hotel.  There are bars across the street that play booming music all night.  Unless you can sleep in the middle of a disco floor, you will not be able to sleep (even with ear plugs).  The second reason is that the owner should not be in the hospitality business.  She made up her own exchange rate even though I showed her a receipt for my deposit.  She also runs a construction business out the basement, so there are those noises all night too.  Stay away!"
50,"This hotel is a very good price.  Basic but what do you expect for cheap price. It has what you need. A comfy bed, shower room, air con etc. We stayed in room 10. Very happy.  Great view of beach from balcony. It's right on main street, there are lots of steps to climb... that's my only gripe. Puerto Escondido...first time there. I would go again and I would book this hotel, esp room 10."
50,"Checked in after we were unhappy with our other hostel we had booked. Very happy with this place-the beds are very comfortable, a stack of nice restaurants outside on the strip, they kindly did washing for us as well for MXN$40.  Friendly English speaking staff was great too. A nice change after spending some time on hostels."
50,"115 steps to get to our room!  Definitely worth it.  We are spending 10 days here, so wanted to settle in a comfortable room, we chose the deluxe.  AC, King bed, kitchenette, and the view!   Staff really nice, spacious room, we come back from one of the pretty beaches around everyday to a clean room.  We sleep very well.   We have our coffees on the terrasse every morning, watch the surfers below. A very nice convenience store just downstairs is open late."
40,"Room was nice and ample with a nice view, ac was a blessing, stayed just one night due to cancelled flight.  The cutlery and dishes in the room looked messy, and we had a bit of an ant problem, so it might've been good to have just a little bit more of room inspection before setting us in, we showed up with no reservations though so no biggie, we fixed the ant problem quickly, def coming back."
50,"LOCATION: Great location. Literally located steps from the main surf beach, Playa Zicatella, and a two minute walk to restaurants / shops.  HOTEL / ROOM: Although there is no common area to socialise, this hotel has rooms to fit all needs. I chose the room with an outside kitchenette and air con and payed double. For those wishing to spend less, you will still get the same great view experience I am sure. The rooms have mosquito screens for the windows and authentic Oaxacan touches to the room like the hand-woven curtains and a really cool clay lamp. Bathroom is basic and functional.  **Note that this property does have approx 40 to 50 stairs to access your room depending on if you stay on level one or two. Not great for anybody with a walking disability.  INTERNET: Internet was"
40,"A comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay in Puerto Escondido. It's right in the middle of the restaurants and bars and just steps from the beach, but because of its high location it doesn't feel like it. Great if you want to wake up to a view, and the staff were polite and friendly. Would recommend."
50,"This hotel is located exactly where you want to stay if you want to walk to everything. You are within a 5 minute walk to the best restaurants, beaches, etc. This hotel is well managed, clean, well built and fully functional. The views from the large, shaded balconies are the best in PE. There is solitude at this hotel. The deluxe room is by far the best and worth it. The other rooms are high quality as well. I stayed in both during my one week at BV. Internet works ok. Beds are firm. Floors are tile. Showers work well. No tv's. this ensures the solitude. A selling point for me. It takes me back to travel in the 70's and 80's. I love it here. "
50,"We have stayed at the Villas several times and look more and more forward to each return. Our favorite ""place to be"" is on our private balcony enjoying the glorious sunsets . The main palapa and pool areas provide relaxing and inviting spaces to swim, lounge, enjoy a cocktail, grill a meal and commune with fellow guests. The new tennis court is a great addition and a unique feature to Puerto Escondido. All the amenities of a boutique, resort hotel with a ""hostess with the mostest."" Christina is a breath of fresh air. Her fun energy and hospitality always makes us feel more like family than guests. Our favorite home away from home!"
50,"Quiet place, 5 min. by car from Zicatela and 5 min. walking from La Punta, this place is wonderful, accomodation is excellent, apts are very good decorated and complete kitchen with all you need! Large beds , big swiming pool and a nice tennis court in front of the aps., the view from the varandas of the sunset is amazing!"
50,"Casnuna , is kind of out of centre of town. Which is very good, since centre town is party centre for the surfing kids. And they party till dawn. Since we wanted an quality vacation, away from our daily hectic life, and surf daily an relaxed wave ( la Punta, just down the street ! 10 min. walk ). And enjoy Mexico as mucho as possible. This was it , with it's spectacular view from our balcony, (specially since Casanuna is build against a hill , 600 feet above sea level ). With the binocular on a tripod parked on our balcony, we could see the surfers taking the waves at Zicatella. And all the tropical birds in the palm and banana trees surrounding the area. When we were there it was dry season, which is very dusty. So for the Mexican circumstances, they kept it pretty clean."
50,"7 israeli college students on vacation are having a blast at casanuna.  it's got everything!!  view, service, toys, and the charm of casanuna is off the charts.  recommended big time! better than the pictures!!!"
50,"We had a great stay with Randy and Cristina at Villas Casanuna last year. The room/areas were very clean and well cared for-- the grounds and pool were pristine and bright, and the hosts Randy and Cristina gave wonderful advice about enjoying Puerto, recommendations for restaurants, beaches, etc. as well as set up massage and horseback riding on the beach for us. Also, Randy was happy to drive us to/from the airport and lend us the car or quad when we needed it. Overall, we had a wonderful trip and stayed in the Penthouse unit which is an enclosed bedroom, outdoor kitchen, and separate bathroom. It is the least expensive room, but has the best views, and no one shares the top level, so it is very private.  I spoke to Randy several times in advance of making the decision to stay"
10,"Very disrespectful and unkind. No respect for a pregnant woman. Our reservation was done via whatsapp. Two days/times we had contact and a confirmation. On our arrivaldate - after a bustrip of 10 hours - the receptionist told me I lied. Even after showing the whatsapp conversation and explaining that I am pregnant. She said they were fully booked.   The reservationbook and the key-wall said a different story, it was obvious there were plenty of other options. Very disrespectful and dissapointing. But in the end we are very happy not staying at this “hotel”. Bad maintenance all over the place and even worse there is a nightclub next to it."
40,"We have rented the whole house for 3 families, a total of 13 people, for 2 wonderful weeks. The house itself has 4 apartments, each with a kitchen, living room, bathroom and 2 bedrooms, and 1 more apartment on the top floor with a single room, bathroom, and kitchen. Plus, the common area has a great and clean swimming pool, concatenated with a ""palapa"" hosting a bar and a barbecue area; plus a living room with TV, a pool table, kitchen, garage, and  a spaceful lawn. It was really worth the costs, and the benefit to watch everyday a different and remarkable sunset was priceless. It's at a walking distance from the Zicatela beach, but sometimes you may want to reach it by car, if taking too many utensils and kids with you. I recommend day trips to Carrizalillo, and Roca Blanca,"
50,"very accommodating stay, great view of the ocean, very friendly owner and a very secure area, we had a pleasant stay and well be back next year."
30,"I stayed at Casanuna for almost a week on the basis of other tripadvisor reviews and was somewhat disappointed.  Whilst the service was great and the communual areas were lovely, I felt that our room was unfinished (no kitchen cupboards, lots of empty shelves etc) and not very clean.  In addition, I had not appreciated quite how far away from the town the villa is."
50,"I have been travelling to Puerto Escondido for many years and with no doubts I find Casanuna as the best  place to stay. It is just what you see in the pictures; nice, spacious and clean rooms/apartments, and good and cozy common areas. It is ideal for families and friends.  On the side Randy made us feel at home, it was like staying at friends house. He even cooked for us some delicious shrimp tempura, and curry. The first morning we spot 2 whales from our balcony and another day we took the quad bike and along the sea we saw a big turtle. It was just wonderful. The only minor detail is the location. If you don't have a car you might feel a bit isolated but it is easy to get a taxi or rent a car of Casanuna. We had our own car so it was perfect. We would like to go back and"
50,"What a great place to stay! We loved every moment at Besame Mucho. the view, the flowers,, the pool, the suite, the 4-wheeler, the pool and ping pong table, the interesting people staying there,every day was a new adventure in Puerto Escondido and they all started at Casanunas. Thanks Randy for an unforgettable vacation. WE WILL BE BACK SOON!!!!"
10,"STAY AWAY!! IT IS NOT HOTEL FOR SLEEPING! Don't let the cuteness of the house and rooms fool you! This hotel is becoming a nightmare during the night as there is a huge and extremely loud discotheque next door so don't even dream about sleeping! The music stopped after 5 am! They did not warn me when I did check-in during the day, that something like this can happen, I would never stay there. I was even at night walking around on the streets and tried to find another place to sleep but there were no free rooms available. On top of that suffering they were arrogant in the morning when I asked refund as I really did not sleep all night and felt awful. They were claiming that it's not their problem at all. Night shift girl had a little bit more compassion, at least she gave"
10,"Way to loud to get any sleep, even though we were told by the manager it had been resolved through municipal noise bylaw. The owner showed up in the morning and grudgingly gave us our money back but also told us to f-off"
30,...attention to details in and outside rooms: Coming here for more than 6 years the owner tries but has to check more details. Price vs. value is ok and everything is very clean. Super location a big plus although nightly noise level (night club  nearby) can be bothersome. 5 % Credit card charge is outlandish.
40," Some small improvements still needed (owner should check rooms more often ) but after being there for more than 6 years in a row a good recommendation: Close to principal beach and restaurants , very clean rooms and good value.  Only drawback near loud discos but not fault of hotel.  Prefer rooms with refrigerator...AC in some rooms available but not really needed.  Check it out!"
30,"The only good thing was the pool and the wifi.   I booked the hotel because I didn't want to wait to my arrival and it was the contrary I have to wait almost 2 hours for my room, the night recepcionist was indiferent. It doesn't look very old in the pictures but it is, the bathroom and bed are very very simple and had leaks,   They can better their service and the amenities because they were BAD."
40,....cares much better about the guests. Some improvements still needed but after being there for more than 5 years in a row a good recommendation: Close to principal beach and restaurants very clean rooms.  Only drawback near laud  disco but not fault of hotel.  Prefer rooms with refrigerator...AC not really needed.
10,Previous stays here have been delightful. But a newly opened disco right next door pumps out a thumping racket well into the wee hours and has ruined the experience. This is no longer a place to stay. The noise is so loud that other hotels close by will also be compromised. Sad.
30,Fifth time here and again there are the small things which the owner should attend to himself : Guests have to point out necessary repairs/ improvements which the owner could have found out easily...he appears not to care which is a pity because hotel continues very well located and clean and being good value for the money. There are rooms with AC if you need it but ceiling fans are fine for us. Personnel is ok but owner could be more welcoming...
30,"I was going to give two stars to this hotel but night receptionist tried his best to resolved the room problems.  Pros: Le Petit Hotel is well located, beach, shopping and restaurants are near by. Hotel was clean and wi-fi is included.  Cons: The room lights did not work at all, bathroom's head shower poured in every direction and only cold water, weak air conditioner. There is a night club next to this hotel..LOUD Music until 3-4 o'clock in the morning.  I gave it three stars because we were moved to two separate rooms and because night receptionist was helpful trying to resolve room issues.  Couldn't rest/sleep because of the loud music from night club  "
50,"The property is small, secluded and beautiful. The owners, Mike and Aileen, work very hard to make sure your trip is as busy or quiet as you want it to be. And the food...oh my goodness the food!!  We’ve been looking for decades to find a place we could be happy returning to year after year. This is it. Best vacation ever.   If lying in a hammock on the roof of your own casita, listening to the Pacific surf and watching more stars than you’ve seen in your life sounds like a vacation, look no further. "
50,"We were looking for something a bit more off the beaten path to relax and decompress after a busy 2017. We certainly found the right prescription with Mike and Aileen (and Mike Jr. and Prime Time) at Gecko Rock.  The food... was absolutely incredible. We quickly learned to have great anticipation for whatever delicious surprise Aileen crafted for us. We had not previously been at a resort where the meals were prepared based on guest preference. It was such a fun experience and if you like flavorful food, you’ll be delighted with the adventure. We enjoyed everything from Tuna Steaks to Mexican Hot Chocolate, and there was not a single bite that was disappointing.  The service... was wonderful. Mike was ever-present and anything we needed was a buzzer press away. Even better, Mike"
50,"Our recent trip to Gecko Rock went above and beyond anything we could have expected! Our stay was the perfect combination of adventure and relaxation. We enjoyed several days sipping cocktails quietly by the pool and meandering down to the beautiful, secluded beach. Other days we went into town and enjoyed snorkeling, authentic Oaxacan cuisine, massages, shopping, and an absolutely fantastic dolphin/ sea turtle/ whale watching boat tour. Everyone we encountered from shopkeeps to taxi drivers were incredibly friendly, helpful, and patient with our awful Spanish.   The resort itself is the epitome of relaxation. Every meal we were served was absolutely incredible. The selection of cocktails was astounding (and delicious!!), and the fridge was always full of cold beer. The"
50," We went here for our honeymoon and could not have asked for a more peaceful and relaxing vacation! And the food was amazing! If you're looking for something private and off the beaten path, this is it!"
50,"It is hard to find words to describe our week at Gecko Rock.  We were the only couple staying at the resort, so it felt like we were at our own private beach escape. Our room was the perfect size, complete with a beautiful bathroom and comfortable king size bed. The beach, which we truly had to ourselves for the entire week, is an easy 2 minute walk from the pool, and the pool was no more than 10 yards from our room.  The only company that we had on the beach was a distant local, fishing with a cast net...the bottom line is that this is not your typical resort beach experience. From the fresh cocktails, to the delicious food that Aileen provides for all 3 meals, we did not feel like we were eating typical all inclusive resort food. Mike serves as the main host and he is"
50,"Our experience at Gecko Rock was one of the most relaxing times we've had. We came right after our wedding and we were immediately relaxed. There was a nice mix of things to do and doing nothing at all. The food was incredible and Mike and Aileen did a wonderful job making sure we were comfortable. We were a 2 minute walk to a very secluded beach and short drive to the local town. We were able to see (and swim with!) dolphins during a boat ride, we saw sea turtles lay eggs, and we went on a lagoon tour and saw alligators and multiple types of birds. Outside of the resort, everyone was very friendly and hospitable! It was definitely one of our favorite experiences thus far and have already recommended Gecko Rock to multiple friends and family members."
50,"Whatever you are looking for you will find here. For those looking to unplug and unwind, you will not find a more secluded paradise. The property oozes with serenity; hang out in the pool, swing in the multiple hammock settings, explore what seems to be your own private beach (you won't find more than a handful of people on the beach in either direction), tour the beautiful landscape or cozy up on the handcrafted lawn chairs. If you are a foodie, you will enjoy the homemade meals; Aileen incorporates ethnic infusion from her worldly travels. She is a truly hidden gem in the kitchen! If you are looking for adventure, there are many attractions in town to enjoy (shopping, surfing, deep sea fishing and more). Mike and Aileen are amazing and compassionate hosts and if you are lucky"
50,The term 'resort' is not really the best way to describe Gecko Rock.  When I think of our week there I would describe it as a refuge FROM a resort.  It was a very special escape from the typical beach vacation scene but still with all the comforts.  Mike and Aileen have built Gecko Rock on a secluded hillside just steps from the Oaxacan coast.  Every day we woke up in a comfortable king size bed and wandered over to the thatched dining room/lounge/bar area to eat breakfast.  Aileen prepared amazing meals for the entire week we were there.  20+ meals is a lot to try and keep interesting but she did it!  Then we would swim or chill out in the various lounge areas around the property before heading down the 5 minute brush path to the beach.  When you get to the bottom all you see
50,The most relaxing vacation we've ever had.  We're already trying to plan a way to get back.   The food was outstanding.  Something new and delicious every night for dinner.  All the food was custom for our vegan/vegetarian diet.   Beautiful and delicious fruit plate every morning with our breakfast.  Our favorite breakfast was the vegan banana bread. We made it a point to be on the beach for the sunsets.  The sunsets never disappointed.   The beach is like a well kept secret.  Warm water.  Soft sand.  Beautiful and very few people.    
50,"A few words immediately come to mind when I think back on our honeymoon: intimate, secluded, perfection!   My husband and I returned from a 5 night stay at Gecko Rock this week and we are already trying to figure out how soon we can get back! The resort is away from it all, but has all the comforts of home. The grounds are landscaped beautifully and the rooms and absolutely perfect. We had a fabulous time relaxing, eating and lounging by the beach and pool. Above all, the food was absolute perfection! The room rate includes three meals a day, which exceeded all expectations. Mike and Aileen have created paradise at Gecko Rock and we simply cannot wait to return."
30,"Average lodging up the hill from Playa Zicatea.... 5 minutes from the beach.  The water was hot and the air conditioner worked great....(IF you paid a lot extra and booked a room with hot water and cooler.)  If you are here in the winter months you need neither...but in the hotter months probably want the air conditioner. Daily cleaning services were so-so. The staff themselves were super nice and courteous, but they ended up pushing the dirt around on the floor with water and some smelly cleaning product. The bottoms of my feet immediately built up loads of grime when I got back each afternoon from the beach. I ended up having them stop mopping the floor and going and buying a large rag and cleaning it myself. The floor was so dirty that it took me ages to get it clean the"
50,"If you are looking for the perfect place to stay for a few nights in Puerto Escondido, then Agua Luna is the place to be. The place is completely new, has its own bar/restaurant at the pool with very good food. The staff is very nice and the Jacuzzi on the rooftop is the highlight to watch the sunset. Overall a very satisfying stay and I recommend this place to everyone who is coming alone or with your couple to Puerto Escondido. They also offer the trip to swim in the bioluminescent lagoon close by - a MUST!"
50,"I booked 4 nights, but ended up staying for more than a month. I sincerely think this place is the best. It's a hotel, but is has a hostel vibe. It is very easy to get to know the other people that are staying there. The rooms are very clean and the swimming pool and roof terrace with jacuzi are great. The little 'restaurant' serves good food and has a pool table where most of the guests hang out. The location is perfect; only a 4 minute walk to the main street of Zicatela where you will find many restaurants and bars. There are also 2 supermarkets within walking distance. And the beach is also very nearby, only a 5 minute walk. It is not the cheapest place to stay in Zicatela, but it is worth it!"
50,"This place is an absolute gem! We loved every minute of our stay here The facilities are great, the staff are very efficient and super friendly  The food is delicious and a reasonable price, you almost don’t have to leave! However if you do want to you are right near the heart of town"
50,"Going back to Puerto, staying in Zicatela and having the luck to made an excellent choice by choosing Aqua Luna is one of the many things that made our second visit amazing. Clay will give you top notch quality of service and he is always accessible and very charm and kind. Ok, thats not all.. Lets talk about the property first: Gated area, secured, with 24 hrs assistance at the door. 2 blocks from Zicatela beach, one block from amazing healthy restaurants. Room with different sizes and accommodations depending on your needs. We stay second floor at the corner and the breeze coming thu our windows will make you to get up in the morning and close the window :) , depending time of year, we loved our breeze on those November nights, didnt even needed a/c.  Had a mini kitchen it,"
50,"This place is rather pleasant!! It has a lot of pluses - top deck with views, ocean breeze and comfy furniture; restaurant with a casual, inviting feel, good food and service, reasonably priced (seriously!!!), pool table; cool pool that's well laid out (compared to others that have a pool but poor design for guests to walk and sit around); and a fabulous host and staff. We got in on a good deal, and were grateful to have quick and reliable wi-fi, plus close to a lot of amenities around town."
50,"If you are coming to Puerto you would be silly not to stay here. Great location, service, atmosphere, pool, facilities, price, everything about the place is awesome. The restaurant also makes some of the best food I've had in Mexico for a great price. Thank you to at Aqua Luna for making our stay so great. I will be back"
50,"Without repeating too much of what other reviewers have said, I highly recommend this place. It's far away enough from the beach to be peaceful, but close enough that you can walk to the shore in minutes. The owners, their family and staff make the experience really personal and welcoming. The poolside restaurant offers burritos, hamburgers, drinks etc. for super cheap and high quality. It took effort to get up and try places outside of the hotel! Picture is of the breakfast burrito for 65 pesos (less than $5 Canadian). I liked the mix of Mexican, Australian, American, Canadian travellers. "
50,"All round 5 star. Staff, food, drinks, prices, rooms, pool and roof top jacuzzi! Went back 4 times this year whilst traveling as it felt like a homely base. Clive the Aussie owner is a bloody legend!   I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Puerto Escondido! "
50,"Great place for the price. Many different options in rooms at different prices. The owner, Clive, is very attentive and is always around to answer any questions you may have. The food is amazing and very inexpensive. Try the Mahi Mahi Tacos. They are to die for. Drinks are strong and inexpensive as well. Due to the dirt road, the place may seem shady, but once  you're in there, heaven on earth. Especially when you go up to the rooftop and sip on your favorite beverage overlooking the ocean and sunset. A true Hidden Gem. Gracias Clive.  Hasta la Próxima my friend."
50,"Nice stay, central and next to the beach. Dominique, Bill and Michele are so kind and friendly.  Nice Pool and bar in the backyard.  Clean and nice interieur and furniture, i would say rhe best place to be."
10,"Asked month in advance on site for quiet accommodation.  Was shown room and assured was Quiet. I had at best 2 hours sleep the 8 nites there because of endless NOISE! Mold smell so bad in room had to use decongestant to breathe. Partying by pool/bar kept me awake, when that settled noisy, inconsiderate guests talked loud, banged doors, spoke on cell phones, played music, and smoked outside my non-smoking room...causing ongoing need of decongestant spray. Was assured nite after nite it would be quiet, would be no problem...each day was a different, rare, unusual exceptional situation. When I made it clear day 9 after 8 nites of max 2 hours sleep/nite that I had to leave, I expected to receive my refund on per diem basis...instead of receiving 7300 pesos I was, following extreme"
50,"We stayed here for 2 months with my boyfriend and this was my second time here. The location is convenient, close to the Zicatela beach, good restaurants, yoga studios and a local grocery store. The rooms are nice and very clean. The staff is very friendly and Dominique is the best hostess. The swimming pool is ideal for taking it easy during the midday heat and the Tiki Bar has ice cold beer for anyone who’s thirsty. We loved the house dogs, cats and turtles. The house has the best vibes and we’ll definitely go back. ❤️"
50,"Amazing place, very clean, great people, rooms with kitchen and hammocks as well. Big garden with very clean pool. I can highly recommend this place :-) spend my second time here...and will come back.   A big thank you to the Casa Bastin Team for this wonderful time. "
50,"Unfortunately we could only stay for one night, but the rooms are perfect! Spacious and clean and with a well equipped kitchenette. The only downside is that the mattresses are a bit hard. Dominique is a lovely host."
50,"this place is like no one other in place on earth, hidden in the palms of puerto escondido, the guys are super clever and the pool is fantastic.!! i reccomand it to everybody!   ps: in the garden there is a bar with super cheap prices.!"
50,"This place looked after us as if we were one of their own . Surf all morning and chill in the self serve bar out back .It gives off such a homely feeling ,as all apartments come with a full kitchen and fridge setup. Its right across from a great restaurant and just a short walk down the hill to mexican pipe where you can easily fit two long surfs in before the onshore sets in and then retire to the backyard for an afternoon of playing pool and sinking the coldest beers in puerto out of the fridge while cooking on the outdoor fire bbq . We stayed for two and a half months and it was so cheap . loved this place..."
50,"Stayed here with some mates for about 6 weeks and had an awesome time. The pool table, pool and bar is an awesome way to pass the time when the surf is flat. The room had there own kitchen so that allowed us to cook our own food and save some money. Most of all the owners were legends with a super chilled out attitude. Made our stay really relaxing. I would stay here again for sure."
50,"My girlfriend and I wandered upon this place, after finding our first hotel option was completely booked.  What we found was a great 4-6 room hotel which exceeded our expectations.  Our hosts were extremely friendly and we felt at home in their hotel.  The hotel is off the main 'tourist' drag of Playa Zicatela by a short 5 min walk.  Set above the beach, the hotel gets a good breeze.  There is a lawn and pool to relax and cool off. The room was clean, spacious (two beds & closet) and came with a fully equipped kitchen & fridge.  Bathroom was clean and had hot water.  We were able to purchase from the hotel a large filtered water jug at face value. The price for the room was better than other hotels in the area and the fact that the hosts cared that we were comfortable made Casa"
50,"I am just back from 2 great weeks in November at the Tabachin del Puerto, in Puerto Escondido.  Each apartment of this wonderful establishment is a gem, and though it's been a couple of years, the experience of staying here is still great.  I had apartment #2, which is the smallest unit, and is the one which figures in the Trip Advisor listing.  November is a quiet time of the year to visit Puerto Escondido, and I had the Tabachin to myself, though I know it will be busy after the first of the year.  I loved the sleepy feeling and the best part about the Tabachin is how you really get to feel like you live there. Though, with daily housekeeping, I know that I'm on vacation.  The staff are wonderfully attentive, and always there for whatever you need.  Getting to be there for the"
50,"Father (me) and grown Daughter who was my trip advisor went for breakfast at the only place in town that served this special corn fungus. The Tabachin is tucked away behind the posh Santa Fe Hotel. The location is beautiful and the architecture and decoration with painted moulded plaster work and fabulous tiles and frescos is outstanding, indeed brilliant. The hotel was full with interesting long-term guests, many being regulars who return year after year. One couple kindly showed us their apartment occupying a high floor. It was spacious with wonderful colonial ambience and spectacular views. The breakast had fresher, tastier fruit and juices than anywhere else! The Huitlacoche was a bland filling in a very nice omelet. But everyone who wants to try real Mexican food should"
50,"Spent a great week there meeting up with family who spend months there. For us, the location rooms, and of course the breakfast were perfect. Clean, good showers and AC, but  the staff were the best. I mean, I walked in and Felix comes out and says you must be Andy. Good guess, and they were expecting us, but I felt at home right away. We shopped, ate and relaxed our time away. Also some fishing for fresh Dorado that was served up one evening by my wife's dad. Favorite times were early morning for walks, evening sunsets, the waves here really do make some sound. The hotel is a bit worn, but in good repair, and the room we stayed in was two floors above the kitchen. But again the staff made all the difference."
40,"I stayed here in an apartment on the floor just below the top floor. Pretty good location, at the edge of Playa Zicatela and very close to the Hotel Santa Fe. The owner, Paul, died in May 2013 and the hotel is now managed by the local staff, under the ownership of Paul's daughter. The apartment is big, with a sizable kitchen and large main room/bedroom. Lots of fans and windows (also A/C, which I was fine skipping), and surrounded by a narrow deck. A delicious breakfast is included - you order from a handful of items on a restaurant menu. And being on the edge of Zicatela, you are convenient to that beach, but also a ~30 minute walk to the beaches Carrizalillo (four stars!) and Puerto Angel (picturesque, crowded with locals)."
50,"My umpteenth visit this winter was as wonderful as always.  I love the mix of regular visitors, new faces, people from across the globe, old and young, different languages.  I stayed in the ground floor Unit One for much of my visit...it is especially large and one does not need to climb stairs to reach it.  The covered patio is great for sitting about and playing cards with friends and other visitors.  And I spent a couple of weeks in Unit Two which is not as large but is the most well decorated of all the apartments, with really nice art work on the walls.  Paul's fine tile work and the light paint colors make this unit stand out.  There have been a good number of new and good restaurants opening around town this past year...new things to explore.  Paul's hotel is exceptional"
50,"This place is absolutely amazing! It's by far the best place we've stay in all our 2 years of travelling. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and fully equip with everything you need. The location is perfect with views to die for and the rumble of the ocean waves crashing on the shore line to put you to sleep at night. Above all this is the staff. We can't express just how beautiful the staff at Tabachin are. The owner Paul is the most humble of gentlemen and a wealth of knowledge who ensured our stay was everything we wanted and more. Felix, a staff member, was there to greet us every morning for breakfast and he went out of his way every day to ensure we had everything we needed and gave us information on any and everything to do in Puerto Escondido. Everyone including the"
50,"I have been to Puerto Escondido three times and this stay was by far the best. Paul Cleaver and his staff made me feel like I was home. The accommodations were inviting and the view was spectacular. The attention to detail; linens, silver place settings at breakfast, the house made bread, jam & chocolate, as well as local paintings in the stairways made this by far a unique stay. The food was exceptional and I had the good fortune to tag along for a weekly shopping trip to the local Saturday market. Perfectly located - not on the loud main strip of the Zicatela and a close walk to the Audoquin. If you are looking for a true experience, learning and sharing Mexican culture, this is the place to start. Paul & Felix are wonderful guides. I express the depth of my gratitude for my"
50,"we loved our huge room with ktichen and view of the ocean.  A lot for the price...and a great and plentiful breakfast with interesting people from all over the world. yes, you can get a place for half the price and less than half the comfort and you can get  a place with greater service and nicer accomodations at more than twice the price....but you would miss out on the great company of the very interesting people staying here and the great proximity to everything Puerto has to offer....a few steps to the beach and restaurants.  In summary...a great value!"
10,My wife and I stayed here back in September.  I don't get any pleasure from writing this negative review because I think the owner Paul is basically a decent and interesting guy.... but here goes.   The staff doesn't speak English and Paul is quite elderly and sleeps in the afternoon. So when we arrived (at the end of a dirt alley to the shabby courtyard... no reception area at all) in the blazing heat and humidity we insisted on speaking to him before being brought to our room. He eventually emerged from his slumber in a stained shirt that it turned out he wore every day.   We were creeped out by the disrepair and disorganization but decided not to bail after the fairly pleasant breakfast with Paul the first morning. Ultimately this was a mistake since our camcorder and some
50,"I had heard about Paul's place for years from a close friend. He went on and on about it so I finally decided to go.  Well, he was right about Studio Tabachin. The rooms are Mexican tiled, include kitchens, cable TV,  air conditioning, cleaned daily and have firm beds. The breakfasts (which are included with your room) are the best meals I have  had in Mexico..period.  I don't know how the cooks do it but they pull off gourmet breakfasts both Mexican and American.  (Paul has a farm where he grows his own coffee, cocoa, fruit, etc.)  The guests are quite interesting and many of them have been coming here for years.  Everyone has breakfast together at long tables so  one really has a chance to meet new people from all over the world.  We were two minutes from the beach and there"
40,"Paul & Joan at Hotel Flor De Maria greeted each one of us warmly, as we gathered in Puerto Escondido for a week of relaxation & classes. The Hotel's architecture is conducive to its location & warm climate. Hammocks beneath thatched palapa, adjacent to a swimming pool and a large covered patio make the rooftop a perfect perch for classes, relaxation, and cake by the ocean. We usually viewed sunsets at the beach just a 2 minute walk below but the rooftop is a suitable option, with great views!  Food at the Hotel was delicious & the staff friendly. Rooms were clean & comfortable, with high ceilings."
50,"We just came back from a week in Puerto Escondido accompanied by 4 family members.  We had the great pleasure to find rooms at this fabulous hotel, run by Joanne and Paul the most pleasant hosts we have ever encountered.... It is a simple place, beautifully decorated , very clean and a block from the beach...The additional advantage is a wonderful restaurant with extremely good food (often the fish waqs caught that morning) fresh vegetables, pleasant atmosphere... This will remain our hotel of choice."
50,"We loved hotel Flor de Maria...our room was comfortable and quiet, fan cooled it beautifully, staff most helpful and professional, owners friendly and accommodating. The covered rooftop with bar overlooking the ocean is cool and inviting, and we dipped into the rooftop pool at least a few times a day..."
50,"This is our second visit to Flor de Maria, and we have to say that it one of the most pleasant hotel we have ever enjoyed... The amenities are normal for a sea front hotel, but what maks it extra special is the proxinity to the Ocean, the incredible kindness of the owners not to mention the very special meals created by Joanne.  We will be back as soon as possible.. There is also a wonderful rooftop pool with a great view of the ocean."
40,"Hello Koh Phangan people,  Yesterday, at the night market in Thong Sala, I ate vegetarian gyros with pita bread for the first time and I loved the taste!  The owner of the market stall offers vegetarian and vegan gyros. She even bakes the pita bread in her bakery herself, cultivates the yoghurt for the Tsatsiki and refines the soya protein for the gyros.  I can really recommend the gyros to you!  Best regards  Sascha from Germany   "
50,"We enjoyed every minute of our five-night stay at Flor de Maria in March 2018. This was our third stay. The room was nice and clean and charming with painted doors and decor. The rooms are on two levels facing a central atrium and all floors are rustic tile. There is a top floor large deck with hammocks and tables and chairs, with sunny and shady spaces. There is a bar there too, with an attendant. Margaritas were good! The deck has expansive views of the beach and ocean, and is nice for hanging out for hours. The beach is only a few steps away. The proprietors, Joanne and Paul, are energetic and friendly and willing to chat or help if needed. They are English speaking and the clientele is primarily English speaking. Guests tend to want to read on the upper deck, and relax"
40,The Hotel Flor de Maria is a lovely old building in the heart of Puerto Escondido. The room was simple but comfortable with a small balcony. There was plenty of hot water and a good shower. It is very quiet at night. The hotel has a very good restaurant that is open for breakfast and dinner and both are excellent. The dining room is covered but it is open aired and a pleasure to eat in. The crowning glory of the hotel is the rooftop - it overlooks the beach and for the most part it is covered allowing for plenty of shade whether sitting in chairs or hammocks. The pool is lovely and well maintained. There is also a bar that serves a good selection of drinks and has a few sandwiches available. The hotel is within walking distance of other restos and bars and of course to the
50,"Stayed for a month. What a pleasure. It doesn't get better than this. Relaxed, friendly professional staff, and really good value for such a beautiful and classy place. This in turn, attracts friendly classy guests who return year after year. Count us in !"
50,"Travelled here with 3 friends. Two spacious rooms. Really nice roof top terrace with sun, shade, chairs, hammocks. Location is great; a short walk to the main beach, lots of local restaurants are within a 5-10 minute walk, and short taxi rides to more distant beaches.  Paul and Joanne were lovely and did all they could to make sure we had the best time possible, which we did."
50,"Joanne and Paul were helpful beyond the norm from the beginning. They were able to book my flights between Oaxaca de Juarez and Puerto Escondido. They saved me a room on the ground floor in consideration of my bad knee. They organized my day trips and pick-ups. They arranged for a bag lunch for a day trip. The hotel is beautifully maintained with a fabulous roof-top patio with a pool, bar and lots if chairs & hammocks under palapa roofs.  The maids all wear beautiful huipils. All of the staff, especially Pedro & Delfina were so lovely and their service & food were impeccable & delicious.  I can never thank Joanne & Paul enough for their personalized help and the care and advice that the offered me. Thank you all at Hotel Flor de Maria for making my vacation do very special. I"
10,Have stayed here many times in past at this lovely spot in Puerto Escondido. However times change and the strip of hotels downtown Zigatela are just not places to stay if you think you are going to get any sleep after midnight. The music starts at 9:30 pm and does not stop till 3 am. I cannot comment on decibel level but in our room with earplugs the music is still out of control. It is like a concert is happening across the street. La Punta everything shuts down at 11 pm so not sure why this is allowed here at Zigatela.
50,"You cannot beat this location. My husband and I came down for our (two years late) honeymoon. We spent our first week elsewhere, and had initially booked a different B&B for our last 10 days. The place we booked was disgusting and we left immediate, my husband had fond memories of staying here at Hotel Ines 10+ years ago, so we gave it a shot. It is just as nice if not better than he recalls - we have stayed in two rooms, both with the jacuzzi tub on the terrace. Since it is a special occasion, we are definitely splurging more than normal, but I must say room 402 is magical. There is the downside of the club down the street, but Hotel Ines is not at fault for this. It is crazy to read reviews blaming the hotel for the noise. If you are a light sleeper, I recommend requesting a"
50,"Perfect location just in front of surf spot and pet friendly. Our room was facing the beach so could not ask for more. All personal was super friendly and give as all information need and even give us many useful tip about surf, food and where to buy good mezcal ;). For sure place where you should stay."
30,"Everybody in the hotel complained about the loud music coming from the disco bar at night. My complaint is more about the Canadians who all start knocking at each other's door at 8:AM every morning (I could sleep another hour or two), asking ""are you ready?"", ""are you coming for breakfast"", ""Will you meet us here/there?""... Loud bits of conversation starting and ending in the stairs, more knocking and re-knocking... A happy crowd, for sure!!  Another lady guest (on her departure day) went down and explained the issue to the receptionist, saying maybe the management could slip a kind note under the doors or put up a little sign in the stairs... I stayed 4 nights and decided to leave as the lady owner told me ""the Canadians"" have been her guests for 20 years, and that yes, they"
50,"We didn’t stay at the hotel but ate at the restaurant and enjoyed the pool for a few hours. Lovely staff, great pool area, good food, and guests we chatted to said the rooms were good too - will definitely look at staying at the hotel when we’re next back."
30,"My husband and I spent two nights. We stayed in room 303 and had a spectacular view of the ocean. The balcony was large and a table and chairs were provided. The mini fridge worked well and glassware was available. The restaurant served consistently delicious meals - the best filet mignon I have eaten. It’s a family friendly hotel so the pool was well used and several people cooked their own food and dined around the courtyard. Quiet time was at 11pm and it was respected. On the down side, road noise continued throughout the night. There were no screens on the patio doors so mosquitoes and no seeums visited us. The air conditioner was noisy and did not cool down the room much. There was a floor fan provided but no ceiling fans. The mattress was a double size futon style so not"
50,we don't stay at this hotel but always eat at the restaurant 2-3 times during our annual stay in puerto escondido.  it is tucked in the back of the courtyard and is all open aire.  the food is always good and the service is good to fair depending on how busy they are.  but remember no one is in a hurry here on the beach.  meals are prepared with care and nothing is overcooked here
30,"We had room 201, which included a balcony looking onto the courtyard pool and a view to the beach beyond. Included A/C and a refrigerator.  We had difficulties reserving the room from the states - I wasn’t able to call them with credit card details (couldn’t get through - perhaps my fault) so had to send my credit card info via email. The dates we wanted / requested were changed before booking so we had to pay for two days we couldn’t use.  My credit card details were hacked soon after this exchange, but Chase caught it and canceled my card.... so beware! "
40,"Had room 203 during my stay there and enjoyed it. It came with a mini fridge and plenty of room while staying there on vacation from December 17th through December 21st. When I arrived a day late (due to plane trouble) I was greeted by the owner of the hotel (I believe his first name was Peter of Hamburg Germany. Delightful conversations with him. The place is popular with italian and canadian tourists escaping what I assume to be the cold weather. I had breakfast there one day- omlette with a side order of beans and salsa. Delicious. The pool was very relaxing as it was never crowded. It appears that they are adding onto the hotel. And there is a dive shop on premises. A plus for divers. Would l come back. You bet. And once again, thanks for the conversation Peter. I enjoyed my"
50,"We have went for dinner several times,we have never been disappointed. Very reasonable price with great portions and selection. Centrally located on Zicatela main road in a courtyard/poolside location, just beautiful!"
50,Stayed here for a week to tune up my surfing skills and had a fantastic time. The staff and location provide for an inevitable awesome time. I will definitely stay here again. They have great weekly packages that I highly recommend. Get the one with the photo sesh and you will not be able to stop looking at the photos of you shredding.
50,"This was my second visit to Puerto Surf house, second visit as good as the first. The Punta where the surf house is located is a half block long dirt street with just enough to get by. If your looking for high end this is not for you. Want chill with beautiful gardens and quaint quiet  accomodations then this is the place. Get away from it here, no TV , beach out the back door , fell safe , enjoy. If the surf is too much check out Carazillo, one of the prettiest beaches in mexico Thank you David , special thanks to Alana and Lester.  Motorcycle trip next year, see you soon ."
50,"If you think you can't surf, you are wrong, you only need a great instructor like David and his team and you will be a wave-rider in no time, promise! Location can't be better and the rooms are ideal for single travelers like me or couples. Definitely visiting Purto Surf again the next season."
50,"I spent the week at Puerto Surf in Puerto Escondido and had an absolute blast. The actual accommodations are really dreamy and while not super luxe, they're exactly what you want if you're planning a relaxed, surf trip. David, Kim and Alejandro were all incredibly helpful - always available to answer questions (in English or Spanish) and have some great recommendations about the town and surrounding area.   Puerto Surf is located in the best part of Puerto Escondido. A sort of chilled, young, backpacker area, it's free from the touristy chaos of Playa Zicatella. Great restaurants and above all, great surf. The surf instructors at Puerto Surf are all absolutely wonderful (shout out to Krotani and Chucho). Whether you do a group or a private, you're in great hands. I started with"
40,"Puerto Surf is a very nice place: beautiful tropical garden, convenient kitchen, hammocks to chill in a peaceful environment. The room is beautiful, comfortable and spacious.   La Punta is exactly what I expected: quiet, secluded, no resorts/mass tourism.   I had surf classes with Maim and Luis. They have great work ethics. I appreciated their professionalism, kindness and humility."
50,"I very rarely repeat a travel destination, but this place warranted the return. We came back for a second time with a group of 6 to enjoy the surfing, tasty food and relaxing time in the communal garden. Walking distance from La Punta (left point break), great restaurants and beach - everything you need for a great vacation.   The surf instructors are all from the local surf scene, friendly and helpful for any level. A garage full of boards to suit any skill level. Lots of communal areas for cooking, relaxing or just hanging out between surfing / activities / meals."
50,"I had really high expectations of my stay here, and they were exceeded.  The house is made up as a tropical paradise, with loads of outdoor lounges, hammocks, and plants. I was in Room 3 which was very spacious, clean and overall appealing.   The staff are ALL excellent.  Alana, Alejandro & Kim in the office are all very friendly, organized and accommodating. I felt very welcomed and valued during my stay.  The surf instructors are true masters of their sport, and very good at applying this knowledge to beginners. They were very organized, courteous, friendly, personable and ensuring the safety of everyone. Thank you Julio, Maim, Ari, Luis & Carlos.  I also recommend adding breakfast to the package you buy - it is a cheap addition, and you get a fresh squeezed juice, yoghurt,"
50,"The accommodation is really beautiful, just at the Punta Zicatela beach (1 min walk). Nice outside kitchen for cooking. Room was amazing. The surf school is the best you can find here, very professional. You will be very happy in this place."
50,"I try to go to Puerto Escondido at least once every year. I always choose to stay at Puerto Surf because it has the best people, rooms and surf instructors in la punta.  David and Swantje are always welcoming and friendly, and they help out with anything you need.  The location is also great, a couple of steps from the beach and from the best restaurants around.  Overall, I 100% recommend Puerto Surf as the place to stay, you will not regret it! "
40,"Great place, big rooms! great location, just a minute walk from La Punta beach ! the staff is really nice, feel like a family ! amazing place if you want to learn how to surf! highly recommended! :) hope to go back soon"
50,"My Wife and I spent 10 idyllic days at the Hotel Santa Fe. We found the staff to be nothing but friendly, courteous and helpful. The rooms are well-appointed, clean and comfortable. The restaurant is without question the best in Puerto Escondido, and very reasonable priced.  There is so much to do in the area that it is impossible to list them all. It is a nature lover's paradise, whether on land, sea or in the water, and probably one of the best surfing spots in the world  during the right months.  We would not hesitate to recommend  Hotel Santa Fe to any of our friends, and plan to return for a longer stay as soon as possible.  George and Rita P."
50,"We have visited Hotel Santa Fe each February for the past eight years. Our stays have been for 3 to 4 weeks. The rooms are bright, clean, and  comfortable, and the experienced staff  has always been friendly and eager to please.  The hotel resaurant is first class, although meatless. We esepcially enjoy the lush garden enclosed pool area, the wonderful ocean view, and the proximity to the beach. Shopping and resaurants are within easy walking diatance, and many more can be reached by utilizing the many city taxis that seem to be always at the door step. Loafing, shopping, dining, beach combing, and ocean fishing are popular pastimes. Santa Fe, while reasonably priced,  is not the least expensive in Puerto, but it surely is the best. We will be back again next winter."
50,"March 17th, 2008  My wife & I just returned from 2 weeks at the Hotel Santa Fe. We go every year and feel fortunate to have been ""adopted"" by the hotel and its employees. Year in and year out we find the same excellent hospitality. We enjoy the ambiance and the healthy food (includes fish and my favorite; giant shrimp grilled in garlic).  We recommend a ""Junior Suite Room"", with a balcony over looking the lower pool,  in the ""French Quarter."" The staff is very willing to accommodate personal preferences; including fresh flowers every morning. There seems to be no turn over in staff as we see the same smiling faces every year and are treated royally. Between sunrise and sunset walks on the beach you can relax by the pool and read or set off on one of the many adventures to be"
50,"For the fifth year, we returned to the lovely Hotel Santa Fe in Puerto Escondido, Mexico.  The gracious and friendly staff, many of whom we've come to know over the years, continue to do their jobs with the utmost care and consideration.  Combined with a great location, delicious restaurant, and an extremely well-designed property, we look forward to returning year after year.  This is the best value we've found in our travels, bar none.  Kathy Crowe Finholm"
50,"We have stayed at the Hotel Santa Fe every time we are in Puerto Escondido for the past ten years.  Our boys grew up there, I recuperated from surgery there, and we made many friends there.  Now, in our late 50s, we go every year because it is comfortable--service is exceptional; quiet--no disco to keep you awake; immaculate--no fake cleaning here; friendly --the owner just helped us ship purchases back to the states; and of course, the most beautifully enchanting place on earth--you have to see it to believe it. We would recommend this hotel to singles, couples, families and yes, seniors.   Don't miss the fab breakfasts or lingering sunsets.  Barb Chase Newbury, MA 01951 (USA)"
50,"I am in the hotel/restaurant business in Napa Valley.  I often travel to Mexico in January and have stayed at the Hotel Sante Fe four times in the past eight years.  I often travel alone and find the sanctuary of the hotel and the friendliness of the guests/staff a positive addition to my solo travel experience.  The pools offer quiet reading areas, the grounds are impeccably kept and the rooms immaculate.  Having a restaurant which offers consistently excellent food on premise is a bonus any traveler  longs for.  This hotel is my #1 in Mexico.  I highly recommend it."
50,"My stay at the beautiful Hotel Santa Fe for a week in November, 2007, was delightful in every way, beginning with the architecture of the hotel and the tastefully decorated rooms. Both inside and out, the hotel is full of charming, authentic Mexican details, such as hand-crafted tiles. My room and bathroom both were quite large, and the shower was very spacious. The hotel staff was friendly and attentive at all times. The two pools with lots of lounging chairs and the palapas amidst the lush tropical landscaping all encouraged relaxation and enjoyment of the beautiful surroundings. 	The location of the hotel was very convenient for many activities: a short walk in one direction led to restaurants and shops and, in the other direction, to the town of Puerto Escondido and all it"
50,"This was our second stay at the Santa Fe.  Our first a year ago was for our friends' wedding.  We stayed in a bungalow room for that trip.  It was simple, but nice.  The pool, restaurant and staff were fantastic.  This time we went back with those now married friends and the four of us stayed in the Presidential Suite.  It was a bargin at $300/night for two rooms, a full kitchen, pool and amazing view at the top of the hill.  For those more adventurous, try the kayaking trip in the lagoon or an overnight at the coffee plantation, Finca Nieves.  The plantation has the same ownership as the hotel and day-trips or overnights can be booked at the front desk.  It is an experience you won't soon forget."
40,"Hotel Santa Fe is exceptional value for the price.  We paid $120.00, inclusive of tax, to stay in a lovely, cloistered hotel with the feel of a small Spanish village...in January.  It was a cool and lush oasis of peace.  We had good, attentive service and enjoyed the food at the restaurant, though we usually ate elsewhere.  There are a number of excellent and inexpensive restaurants close by.  El Cafecito was our favorite.  The treads on the winding staircases are backed with colorful Oaxacan tiles.  In fact,  very pretty tile ""murals"" were in the restaurant and elsewhere.  We had a delightful five-sided room with a flower and vine-covered balcony overlooking one of the lushly landscaped pools and the ocean beyond.  The windows and balcony doors were arched and little screened"
40,"We stayed at the Santa Fe for three nights very recently (2-4 AUG). We originally planned to stay just one night as we were en-route to Acapulco from Oaxaca but the drive from Oaxaca to Puerto Escondido was a 7 hour maratthon through the mountains without a straight road in sight! Something they don't mention in the guidebooks. The Santa Fe does have a slighlty worn edge to it but our room (No. 60) was spacious and we did not have a problem with bugs etc as mentioned in other reviews - just a few mosquitos, but if you ask reception they will spray the room which gets rid of most of them. The bed was comfortable and there was always plenty of hot water. The musty smell was fainlty noticeable but with the levels of humidity on this coast not surprising. We noticed similar musty"
50,"Staying a casa Kei is like staying with friends in a very unique house. Pepe was extremely helpful and friendly all along. We shared a dinner together and got some tips of places to surf (Pepe being a surfer himself). Our room was at the top, with an stunning view of Punta Zicatela and the natural breeze as a companion. We had absolutely no trouble with cold (Puerto Escondido is warm year-round) nor with mosquitoes (Pepe kindly provided a mosquito net which did the trick). We had 2 fantastic nights in casa Kei, and we hope to be back at some point :)"
50,"Pepe is a very generous host, a really cool guy to hang out with and well-versed conversationalist. He knows everything about his town, the region (he's from Oaxaca City and has been in Puerto for nearly a decade) and a great many other things, and is always handy with information about how to get places and what to see and do. He knows everybody in town, too. His place is set in a beautiful tropical garden in a rustic neighborhood, and the palapa-roofed rooms are the ultimate in simple beach living. The views from the top two floors are amazing. It's a 5- or 10-minute walk to the beach, but you can check the surf from upstairs. Pepe really went over the top by offering things like coconuts, hibiscus juice, Oaxacan cheese sandwiches and even a whole meal of fresh-caught tuna. If"
50,"One of the nicest placed I've ever seen in my life! Pepe is a great host who makes you feel very comfortable and at home in his magic,peaceful, little paradise! Check it out, you'll definitely like it!"
50,"I have been in Casa Kei for 2 weeks like a couple. This house is simply sweet and charming. Just 5 minute walking to the see, you can hear by night the waves (thing i love most). For the surfer I immediatly understood was the right place, and if you are not  a surfer I recommand you to try some lessons, it such a part of funny time. The owner of the place Pepe has a total 100% open mind, he will help you as much as he can and tells you everything you need to see around (I realised that things was missing in lonely planet then). If you plan to have a new experience, you need to book your holidays in Casa kei. There you'll have a pure point of view of what is mexican life and nature.  We will definitly be back there."
50,"Hello :) We traveled trough Mexico and had a good time in Puerto escontido Casa kei! Pepe was so friendly. He helped us with the luggage, showed us his hostal and made a delicious welcome-drink!He also can give you advice for some great beaches and restaurants. We felt like to be part of a family. Its a good place to enjoy your life. In Casa Kei you have everything you need and you can enjoy some great evenings.The garden and the rooms are so lovely prepared and the beach is near by(-which is definitely a Paradies for surfer!)  So if you are in Puerto escontido you should take a rest in Casa Kei for sure! Greetings "
50,"I love how open and unique each floor is, the cat is precious, clean, lots of beautiful trees and flowers, and tons of amazing art and decorations.  Great location because its walking distance from many small mercados and of course, the punta playa. I like this part of the coastline best because the beach is secluded , lots of areas for exploring, and the village surrounding it is very natural, filled with biodiversity and friendly folks. I totally recommend this house if you dont want to worry about a thing!"
50,"Pepe is a great host, I stayed here with a friend in the top room (which i call the tower) and then the bottom floor room. We were comfortable and could tell we were in good hands with Pepe, he goes out of his way to make you feel welcome. Great enchiladas from the lady on the corner! I  found myself relaxing every day and admiring the garden and the cat .Very chill.  Thanks Pepe!"
50,"the rooms offer great views, the host pepe is friendly and easygoing. Although i dont surf ive heard good things about the waves. the acomadation is a short walk from the beach and boasts a beautiful garden :) i enjoyed my time here"
50,"CAsa Kei rocks! Its location was ideal for having a surf base in Puerto escondido because it lies right in between la punta (point break) and zicatela(Beach break). The house is rustic and comfortable with a gorgeous garden with tons of hammocks to lounge in during the day. We stayed in the third floor's room which had an unbelievable view facing la punta of puerto escondido, which is really convenient because you get the surf report the second you open your eyes to wake up. The breeze up there was incredible also. The walk to the punta is only about 6 blocks away, and the colectivos that take you to zicatela, downtown to the market or to la barra for 7 pesos are 2 blocks from the house. Also there is a really good taqueria right on the corner of the street the house is on"
50,"We loved our time at Casa Kei. Pepe is a great guy, and the view of the sunset from the top room is the best in town. He's in a really good part of town, super close to the beach, but down the beach from all the touristy hustle and bustle. There's a few little shops and quiet restaurantsbars nearby, but a few blocks away so his place is still quiet. The lady on the corner sells the best tacos and loves to help you practice your spanish. Pepe's english is perfect. Stay here for a more authentic and local Escondido experience."
50,"This is a gorgeous little hotel in a perfect spot in Puerto Escondido. They could not have been more welcoming (delicious breakfasts, great local tips, booked us onto a dolphin watching tour). The location is great - quiet but near a strip of restaurants and shops and most importantly, a 5 minute walk to the stunning Carrizalillo beach. We were given a room upgrade, had a beautiful view and loved every minute here. We would return in a heartbeat."
50,"Quinta Lilli- so great! I booked this spot because I love to swim, and had read up about the beaches in P.E.  Quinta Lilli is the nearest independent hotel to Carizalillo beach, which also has a pool.  I selected it for those reasons, and for it's flamboyant design, as well as the nearby restaurant strip with the award winning Almoraduz.    5 stars because of the sweetness of the staff, the fun design of the place, and the general cozy vibe.  My only heads' up to fellow travelers is that parts of the website might need updating.  I'd booked a room for the ocean view, but a house had been built in the sightline of that room since the photos were posted. Luis was extremely kind and upgraded me to the top floor, where I had an amazing ocean view from multiple windows, and my own"
50,"I stayed at Quinta Lili for almost six weeks recently and was delighted. The rooms are spacious and airy, the house is spotlessly clean and well designed, the pool is refreshing and well maintained. The breakfasts are wonderful and the family could not be more welcoming or helpful. It's in a great location right by a parade of shops and restaurants and yet just a 2min walk to Carazalillo beach. I highly recommend and look forward to returning."
50,"This little hotel is just perfect. The family who runs it could not be more friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The room was super clean and confortable. Breakfast was simple and excellent: it always had fresh fruit, coffee, and a home made traditional hot dish from the kitchen. The family also brews their own craft beer (how cool is that?), which is excellent and always available to guests for a small price. The location is hard to beat: a quiet neighborhood within walking distance from a great beach (Playa Carrizalillo) and some of the best restaurants and chill bars in PE. Playa Zicatela is a short taxi ride away; taxis are affordable and widely available. I can’t wait to go back. I recommend visitors ask for the perfect spot to watch the sunset (it’s right there in the"
50,"This was our second visit to Quinta Lili and our first as a family. Adelina and her team (again) made us feel like if we were at home. The breakfast is just AMAZING, nothing can beat the great conversations with Adelina, Rosy and the other guests, while enjoying fresh fruit and local dishes. Everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating, as we travelled with our 3 Yr old. We are counting the days to go back to Puerto Escondido and stay at Quinta Lili!  "
10,"Warning! Our confirmed reservation with Quinta Lili proved worthless when we arrived at the hotel last week at the 9pm time  we said in an email to Luis . No one answered the door, the phone number was disconnected, and they didn't respond to email. Stay Away. They either closed or have completely flaked out. Luckily with the help of our guide we were able to book somewhere else."
50,"This review is in relation to the online communication of the hosts at Qunita Lili.  Unfortunately we had to cancel our trip to Mexico because of government travel restrictions in Canada because of Covid-19. We had passed the cancellation period to receive a refund, the owner / staff responded to my messages almost immediately, and refunded us the full amount we had paid.  Shame we never got to visit as the place looks beautiful, but 10/10 for online customer service."
50,"A unique and special place Adelina and Rosa made us feel like home Friendly, reasonable and unique, would recommend for anyone Excellent home made breakfasts were a great way to start each day Location an easy walk to a variety of restaurants "
50,"We stayed as a family with two young children in one of the pool rooms. We couldn’t have hoped for a more hospitable and friendly reception. The breakfast that Rosa prepared freshly every morning produced a new home cooked wonder every morning. Rosa was incredibly nice with the children and created such a welcoming vibe - nothing was ever too much. Adelina was the perfect host and helped organise our complete life in Puerto. It was all done with a few whatsapp messages, even when we needed a paediatric for a minor ailment. Our only mistake was to book another accommodation in Mazunte ahead - we should have stayed longer. "
50,"Tucked away in a beautiful neighborhood, Quinta Lili is ideally located only a few minutes walk from excellent restaurants and several popular beaches for swimming and sunbathing.  Rosa (Rosie), prepares wonderful traditional Mexican breakfasts and is very patient when practicing your Spanish!  She also ensures that your rooms are clean and comfortable.  The swimming pool is a great place to relax when you return from your day of tours, tanning and shopping. If you are lucky enough to reserve the top floor room, the hot tub is a perfect spot to end your day with a sunset over the ocean.  Adelina is the perfect host with a welcoming smile and flawless English.  I look forward to future stays.  If you want to experience a little piece of real Mexico in beautiful accommodations, I"
50,My wife and I loved staying at Villa Lily! The nicest and most hospitable family runs it and offers a delicious breakfast every morning.   It’s one block off of the main boulevard with restaurants and bars close by. The beach is a 5 minute walk.   We couldn’t have asked for a better place for our stay in Puerto Escondido and hope to come to back soon.
50,"This was our first stay in PE and Villa Lili made it so special. Inviting, comfortable, clean, hospitable are just a few words to describe this gem. A family owned and operated boutique hotel that goes out of its way to accommodate and make your stay memorable. Comfortable beds, clean, well appointed rooms. A very delicious and nutritious breakfast that starts your day; no need to eat till supper. Great pools to cool down in. Rooms with views on the upper levels, even sunset. If you want information on the area, things to do or medical advise, Adalaina will help you and make arraignments where she can. We fell in love with our PE family at Villa Lili and will definitely return. "
50,"My husband and I have stayed at Villa Lilli three times, the most recent being over Christmas, 2019.  We keep going back because it really is an amazing place.  All of the rooms are unique and comfortable, and every year there are improvements and upgrades.  This year we stayed in the top floor room with a fantastic view of the ocean.  Breakfast of local Oaxacan specialties is provided every morning, cooked and served in the outdoor kitchen.  Villa Lil is in a perfect spot right off the Riconada - it's only a 5 minute walk to many great restaurants, as well as the convenience store, laundry service, and other shops (including an ice cream shop).  I can't recommend it highly enough."
50,"This villa is the definition of hospitality. When we arrived at around 10 am we were immediately greeted by the owner’s father and then offered breakfast. Breakfast choices included the dish of the day and/or an omelette, fresh fruit, yogurt, and watermelon or other fresh fruit  juice. But they were very willing to make us anything they could (e.g. pancakes). The room was spacious and  although it did not have AC, there was a big fan, which kept us cool enough despite the very hot weather. The room also did not have shades on the windows, so we were awakened the first morning by the sun. However, as soon as we mentioned this, they were quick to fix it, amazingly hanging a curtain the same day. The villa also has a very nice pool (narrow but long), which is kept clean and clear."
50,"In no time will you feel you are part of the family! Adelina and her staff are so kind and thoughtful, and we connected easily on so many levels. The rooms are spacious, the breakfast is absolutely delicious and prepared as you sit down. Adelina’s recommendations for activities were spot on and she is overall a wealth of information for anything going on in the town. When my young daughter fell and scraped her knee, staff quickly attended with a piece of aloe plant to be wrapped around the wound. I am grateful for the many interesting conversations with Adelina and her family, and can only highly recommend this place. Come. Enjoy. Make lifelong memories and friendships."
50,"I dont even know where to start. It’s a home away from home. Perfect place for a family vacation. The staff are over the top kind. Adelina so helpful and knowledgeable. From booking boat trips to beach suggestions to helping me find a traditional cake for my daughters birthday and stringing up a piniata. Breakfast each morning is gourmet. So much selection. Fresh fruit, traditional meals and pancakes for the kids. Rosie has my tea ready each morning. Flor was so kind with the kids. And Moritz brings joy and laughter to each day. We will be back. This is a little gem we are so glad we found. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Everything easily walkable. Come. Book. You won’t regret it."
50,"We were so fortunate to have chosen Villa Lili for our one month stay in Puerto Escondido. Our daughter and family also  joined us for one week. We all agreed that we could not have made a better choice. The warm welcome, the flexibility in adapting the rooms for us and Adelina's helpful guidance in arranging tours etc was outstanding. These were just part of their excellent service...And to make it more memorable we were spoiled by Rosie's amazing Mexican breakfasts accompanied with bowls of fresh fruit, juice and yogurt. Every morning a different dish - we could hardly wait to see what mouth-watering dish would be served. Not only was it great but also plentiful, and seconds were always available.  Villa Lili, designed and built by Luis, is unique and fun in its decor. We had"
50,"After 50 hours travelling from Australia, Villa Lili was jusy what I needed (note stay was actually in January 2018). Perfectly located a short walk from a strip of restaurants and shops and the beautiful Playa Carizzalillo, Villa Lili is a treasure. The accommodation itself is wonderful, with comfortable rooms and amenities and a really nice pool area to chill. Markets and Playa Zicatella were also within walking distance (Zicatella maybe 30 minute walk but the views along the way are worth it). What really made my stay though was the hospitality from Adelina and her wonderful family. Sitting down for a delicious home cooked breakfast (different every day of my stay) and chatting with whoever was around at the time was just lovely. Adelina was also too happy to help with"
50,"We had a lovely vacation stay at Villa Lili. Love the service, breakfasts and pool. Adelina was very helpful. We would highly recommend and definatly stay again. Thank you to the staff for a comfortable stay."
50,"We have been to Villa Lili for three of the past five Christmases and have already booked our flights for next year. It is an absolute treasure. Adelina, Alex and their son Moritz make it feel like you are a guest in their family home. The rooms are large and very comfortable. The breakfasts in the morning are simply sensational (thanks to the amazing Chef Rosie). There are beautiful beaches and restaurants on the doorstep but often we just sat and relaxed by the pool and soaked up the calm, relaxing atmosphere. It is a truly special place in a lovely area. I couldn’t recommend it more highly."
50,"I stayed at las olas for a month this summer, and it was fantastic. Manuel, Maria and the entire staff are wonderful people. A friend stayed in the cabanas and I stayed in the dorms.  The dorms have SCREENS on the windows, which means no bugs. I think the fans are run off of a nuclear reactor:). There are NO bed bugs as the previous reviewer stated. I know because I'm management for 4 hotels in Breckenridge, CO. The sores are likely from Mosquitos or  sand fleas. Pay a month or weeks at a time and get a discount. One final note: SECURITY GATE!!  Makes you feel pretty safe in a somewhat dangerous city. "
20,"Spent two nights here. The room was very spacious and so was the bathroom. When checking in, we noticed 3 guys checking out with their legs red with buttons/bites. Unfortunately I left with about 30 bed bug bites.  Theres also a required 500 pesos deposit..."
40,"We stayed at Hotel Las Olas for 9 days and found it to be comfortable (aside from the heat) and perfect location... Northern end of Zicatela where the surf is, great cheap beach cafes, mini mart 20 meters down the road and a short taxi to anywhere else. We negotiated a cheaper price per night for the length of time we were staying there. Although the managers didn't speak english, they were very helpful. Comfortable stay for the price, small safe, TV, nice bathroom, our rooms were cleaned each day and we were given fresh towel daily (luxury!)... BUT if you want A/C you have to pay an extra 200 pesos per night which we passed on. Extreme price difference per night just to have the A/C unlocked in your room. We left the door open whenever we were in the room to allow some breeze"
50,"Everything about this place was what I was looking for. Close to beach, cheap, quiet, cozy. The staff was great . Although didn't speak any English. There is a lavendaria up the street, and I had a mini fridge in the room.   I stayed in a suite without a washroom to make it cheaper- the washroom was a separate locked door through the courtyard with its own shower. Perfect for me. But I am not picky."
40,"We were just arrived in Zicatela and looking for a confortable room to spend 3 nights. The vacancy sign caught our attention and the room clerk came and offered us a room that was much better than she described: ample, a double and a single bed, mini fridge, fan and flat screen with cable tv. The bathroom is clean and nicely decorated with mexican tiles and designs and you have a lovely terrace overlooking the sea.  It's 20 mts. distance from the beach. Close to ATM's, restaurants and an Oxxo convenience store. All for  250 MXN/night. Perfect for couples."
50,I have really enjoyed my stay in Puerto Escondido.  The Hotel Las Olas is centrally located on Zicatela Beach.  I stayed in one of the cabanas which was clean and comfortable.   The owners recommend some great places to eat and made sure I was comfy.  I would recommend it anytime.
50,"great staff ,nice people very helpfull. really like this small hotel it is not an hostal all rooms are private ,clean my own shower and i could shower when ever  stayed in the bungalow ,nice garden lots of green. nice beach shower right in front of the beach , best place on zicatela"
10,"We stayed here for three nights in one of the cabanas. The wooden cabanas are nice, but placed on a concrete backyard. Unfortunately, the hostess is extremely unfriendly making us wanna leave the place right after waking up. There are many irritating rules, like washing of clothes is not allowed (!) and when you have to shower! Also they did not let us store our bags in the hostel after checking out, because they don't have space ;) There are many nicer hostels on the same street for the same price (or less), which are much nicer!"
40,"Really nice, cosy and clean hotel with incredibly low prices. Excellent location, there is lots of cafes, restaurants and little shops around and Playa Zocatela is few metres away. Recommended if you're on a budget and want comfortable and tidy place to stay."
50,"For a mid range hotel, this was incredible and cozy and all I could ever want! I was so fortunate to get a cabana., it had 2 beds, with mosquito nets. It had a high powered fan, a sink, fridge and cookstove for what a case of beer cost's in Canada or the USA, of course a bathroom and shower. A very nice veranda that if you choose you can swing in the hammock and read or just listen to the waves as they crash on to land. I enjoyed coffee sitting at the table each morning.  The owners are very respectful and there is 24 hour security. They do take a deposit,but are very prompt to return it when they leave. I left a tip daily for the housekeeper as she was incredibly fast and efficient.   The owners feed nightly the hungry dogs, not in the compound, but on the street he has food"
30,"Price, cleanliness and location still good, the hotel should get more attention to details: room fixtures not working, doors not closing well, pool furnishings decrepit. A shame because in general we still like the property and hope this comment helps."
30,"Hotel is a budget hotel so room was basic, had noisy Ac and bathroom was a bit shabby, but clean. Another pillow would have been nice. Hotel grounds are very nice, hammocks and tables/chairs for relaxing. Little pool but we were the only ones there so was well received from the hot sun. Location is great, night market with some great bargains. Parking available opposite the hotel."
50,"This place was a nice break from the cheap hostals we had stayed before. It was clean and peacefull, our room was spacious and nice and they provided drinkable water for the guests. It was close to the Playa principal, but we didn´t like that one and had to walk 20 minutes to the other playa which was much nicer- this was the only downfall we found, plus the room was a little stuffy during the hot night.  You can also walk to playa Zicatello to watch the wawes. It is very close to the main pedestrian zone which is nice in the evening."
30,"Le P'tit Hotel is not a bad place to stay--convenient location for Playa Principal & its bars and restaurants; kept clean; refreshing swimming pool--but it's far from wonderful: the owner is bewilderingly unfriendly for such a small hotel (no welcome, no greeting of any kind); the building and its fixtures are looking worn around the edges; and there's no bar for guests, which means that you have to leave the hotel for your morning coffee & evening cocktail and it makes the place feel cold; an we had close encounter with a scorpion in our room. It looks like the hotel once had a decent view of the water but it's been obscured by an inappropriately large hotel in the process of being built. You could do worse than staying here but you could probably do better."
40,"Our third stay, still a well located gem, clean, friendly staff, some rooms with airco but others with good fans and refrigerator. You will not be disappointed and be happy with the value...go for it !"
40,"A very quiet place to relax in Puerto Escondido. You can swim here at the upperlevel in their own private swimmingpool. Also the housekeeping does a great job, The rooms have plenty of space and are very clean. Even the hotel is situated close to the beach, what more do you want?"
40,"The hotel is very pretty and was a much needed break for us after staying in cheap hostels. The pool is refreshing, and the hand painted tiles, hammocks, and artistic touches make it very comfortable. I love that it's built around a mango tree that supplies treats all day long. The staff was very nice and helpful. Great location as well."
50,"I spent 4 days here and found it an ideal place to stay. It was quiet, very clean and comfortable with courteous service. It's situated at a quiet end of the town and opposite a very helpful Tourist Office where the lady running this service leads an enjoyable tour of the old town."
50,This hotel was more than we expected. The price is fantastic for what you get. Clean and basic rooms. But for a few days stay you really don't need anything else. Good location close to main beaches. I would highly recommend staying here. Enjoy! 
50,"We had stayed at Le Ptit Hotel in 2006 as a couplr and went back for 4 days this year as a family. Great place to stay in Puerto Eacondido. Literally across the street from the beach and 10min walk from Zicatela.  Nice service, friendly hosts, the pool is small but is perfect to chill out after the beach and especially with children. Environment is very nice at any time of the day or night and a big mango tree sits beautifully in the middle of the building. Rooms are really clean and big enough. The ceiling fans do the job at night when the rooms are hot from a sunny day. We haven't heard the noise from the disco that other reviews have spotted although our room was close to the street.  Only drawback: they have no restaurant to serve breakfast or dinner. This would add so much"
50,The rool was equipped of a kitchen and a balconit with a beautifull view on the ocean. It was also equipped with air condition. The owner was really kind and very nice ! This is a great place and quiet.  
40,"The stairway to the room with the best view in town is nothing to be taken lightly but definitely worth it! The room provided a very comfortable bed, kitchenette and of course a hammock on the deck with a breathtaking view. The accommodation is located right in the centre of the main beach and we were even able to walk to the markets from here (~20minute walk). The owner was very friendly and accommodating and spoke perfect English, if you are Spanish impaired like us. Would definitely stay here again!"
40,We had the apartment on the top. Great views. Clean and tidy.  No noise from others although surrounding building works was annoying. Steep stair climb from the street so It's a calorie burning climb everyday
50,"I have been coming to Puerto Escondido for over twenty five years , and I have known the owners of this place since the beginning. Wonderful people that will take good care of you. They speak English and maintain great rooms and there is not a better view in any other hotel around here, hands down.  We always feel safe when we are here. And our stuff is safe. What more do you want when you are traveling. They are very knowledgeable about the local area and there are many wonderful adventures in the immediate area.   Escondido  has grown a lot since my first visit. But this place and these folks have never changed."
50,"This room, and the owner Aide, saved my trip for me. I arrived during low season in early October for a 2 month stay. I tried 3 other hotels in the first week and was not happy and feeling depressed but finally settled here for 7 weeks. I stayed in the top room with the best view from any hotel I have stayed in the past 5 years of travel. A cheap rate, nice kitchen, very clean and 2 very good staff plus the especially nice English speaking Mexican owner Adei. I was very happy here and highly recommend it. Don't worry about the stairs as you will get used to them. The view makes it worth the effort."
50,"Stayed here with my gf for a week. Try to get the room at the top - it's cheap (by zicatela standards), has air con, en suite, and kitchenette AND a hammock on the balcony with the most phenomenal view imaginable. It's a surfer's wet dream checking the waves every morning from the bedroom window. "
50,"The Buena Vista Hotel is an affordable, comfortable hotel with really, not only the best views in Playa Zicatela but also the best service. I stayed here for a month with 3 friends and we all became great friends with Aide, the owner and her staff, who are all super attentive and approachable. Which makes the rooms tidy and fresh, everyday. The Hotel is directly across from the beach and right above a fine eatery and only a short walk from the handful of restaurants in Zicatela.  I really wouldn't recommend staying anywhere else.  Thanks again, to Aide, Dani, the staff and Baxter!"
50,Could not speak more highly of this fine establishment and our time at Playa Zicatela. The things that take this from a good hotel to one of the greatest is the soft and reassuring sensation of the bath mats and the cleasing outdoor shower enjoyed after a hard day out on one of the worlds greatest breaks. Ensure that you request room numero 10 and put all waste paper in the bin provided. Thanks for having us xx
50,"I definitely recommend staying at Buena Vista. In the heart of Zicatela, opposite the beach, amazing view with happy and attentive staff. Rooms and bathrooms are clean and tidy along with comfortable bedding. Planned to stay 1 week ended up staying 4. If possible request the room at the very top of the hotel. The best view in puerto escondido! "
40,"200 Pesos for a nice clean room with fridge, overlooking the sea, what more do you need. There is a balcony with chairs, lokking out to the sea. The room is big enough with two beds, a small table and chair.  Just a few steps up from the beach road"
10,We came to this hotel through airbnb. When we came it was really nice and sattele the food is amazing and so cheap.  When we want to check out we so that one bottle of mazcal we had sombody took it. We went down to the reception and we saw it almost empty.  We talked to the recption about it and he called the owners.  The owner came and was so aggressive he said that the blame is on us. He called the police and said were going to jail.  He asked the police to search on our car for drugs.  Really really bed experience i wouldn't wish anyone.
40,"My partner and I traveled to Mexico, Puerto Escondido after travelling in a van for 5 weeks in the USA ! So we felt right at home almost instantly with the relaxed and homely vibe that Aqua Luna provides. They even have resident Dalmatian named Bali who is always keen for a cuddle.   Aqua Luna came recommended highly by friends who have stayed previously. Clive the owner is always around to give advice on which surf spots need which swell and just general local knowledge, being a keen surfer himself. All the staff go above and beyond to cater to their guest needs . Rooms are cleaned pristine daily. Rosa whom works behind the food and bar has perfected a simple and delicious menu - we often didn't bother going out because her food was so good. The fish tacos and breakfast burrito"
50,I stayed here for 2 weeks and had a ball! The food is unbelievable and cheap! There's a roof top which is great for checking the surf and watching the sunset which also has a spa. The staff are very nice and helpful! Aqua Luna is walking distance to the beach and the night clubs which is a bonus! Out of everywhere I stayed in Mexico this was definitely my number 1!
50,"We stayed at hotel Aqua Luna for a couple of days and it was not only a good price, but the suite was very clean, fresh an ver near to Playa Zicatela (a top place for surfers). We recommend it 100%. The food and the smoothies onsite are very good.   We recommend to try the Spirulina cafe about 2 blocks away for healthy breakfast and the La Ola tacos as they make the best fish tacos ever. "
50,"We booked this hotel for our honeymoon, and didn't really know what to expect. Needless to say we were pleasantly surprised! Our room was spotless and the air conditioner kept it nice and cool (we had the loft room), and it was in a quiet area away from the pool. The staff was amazing from start to finish. Check-in and check out were easy and accurate. You can bill your meals to your room during your stay or pay cash, which is awesome. The menu is small but every single thing we tried was delicious! Clive introduced himself to us early on and made it clear if we needed anything at all to just ask!  It is a short walk to Zicatela and because it was so close we walked a ton more than we normally do. Quick cab ride over to Carazalillo and totally worth the trip up and down the"
40,"Lovely place that we found on AirBnB. Very friendly staff and the hotel is adults only. I thought that might mean that it would be ""party central,"" but there is a rule of quiet hours after 11:00 PM and guests do adhere to that rule. There were several 20-something surfers staying there while we were there (we're old 40-somethings) and they were quiet. (The neighborhood roosters will start crowing at 3:00 AM but nothing you can do about that!) The rooms are airy, clean, and comfortable. There is a roof terrace (steep climb to 4th floor) that has a great ocean view (see my picture). The hotel restaurant serves fresh, healthy food. The hotel is a quick walk to El Morro, the main tourist drag along the Pacific and Zicatela beach. I would definitely stay again!"
50,"Great location within walking distance to Playa Zicatela. And, if you're up for it, a nice walk to Punta Zicatela. Fantastic value, great food, beautiful common area, and a staff that is amazing. Super clean, laundry facilities, terrace with a nice view. The front desk was so helpful and kind. I will definitely be back."
50,Third time staying in pe and this was our favorite place to stay. Stayed two weeks in the basic rooms...room and bathroom were nice for a basic room. Two fans in that room made for a very comfortable temp..... Could be hot in the summer though when you more or less need ac. Clive the owner is a super nice guy and the rest of the staff is all local. The location is cool as you are removed from the beach just enough and there are great restaurants right there....dans  for breakfast and las olitas for tacos ....food at the hotel is great too and so are their infused mezcales 
50,"Awesome hotel, super friendly, best view and near the beach. Booked for 1 week stayed for 2 1/2 weeks.  Great staff and very good value for money . I hopefully will be returning as soon a possible in 2017."
50,"We stayed here for 2 weeks and absolutely loved it! Nicknamed the ""vortex"" because this place seems to attract a great crew of travellers and surfers that all manage to become family by the end of it. The pool and entertaining area is great. Good bar and some of the best food in Puerto. The jacuzzi on the roof top is a great addition to an already amazing place! Thanks Cliffy for a great stay! "
50,"The most telling thing about our recent six day stay at the Hotel Tabachin was  that most of the other guests were repeat visitors, one couple having returned  for 15 years in a row.  Their loyalty is completely understandable.  The location is excellent, the rooms spacious and immaculate, and the host (an American expatriate) engaging and informed.   On top of that, the price is right.  Oh, and the breakfasts are wonderful, with lots of choices – if you want something not on the menu, they'll do that too.  Puerto Escondido is changing as Mexico invests in its tourism industry, but today it is still a charming beach town, and the Tabachin is just the place to relax and enjoy it."
50,"Truly a bed and breakfast.   This is an amazing place to stay.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.   Air conditioning is a blessing.  The staff is friendly and always goes above and beyond.  The breakfast can be customized for your tastes and are amazing.   I'm still missing the bacon.  Don't pass up your opportunity for a comfortable, quaint and relaxing vacation.  "
40,HOTEL TABACHIN   is a fine hotel woth the pesos ..  Great desayunos prepared in timely manner.   Big rooms with nice art and history .   Good service and Paul is a wealth of history and conversation.      Hotel is close to zicetela action but far enough away to get some decent sleep.
50,"Staying at Studio Tabachin is the best reward after a long winding trip from Oaxaca City to Puerto Escondido.    The view from the penthouse room is breathtaking.   The host, Paul, and his staff are very kind and helpful.   There are more than ten different selections for breakfast.  There's art everywhere in Tabachin.  It is the most enjoyable lodging experience ever.  Don't miss it for a lap pool."
50,"We have been to Puerto just for few hours and we found the hotel accidentally. Although we came out of seasson, we have been welcomed by the personal. If you have ever imagined a mexican tropical site on the ocean - it is hotel Tabachin - colourful paintings, white balustrade balconies, old decorated wooden furniture with the right touch of time that passed around. A place with magic atmosphere, hidden among the palm trees just few meeters from Pacific ocean. We came from cold and grey central Europe and this place was unreal for us, beyond our expectations. That spectacular place with friendly staff is coronated with his owner, Mr. Paul Nunn Cleaver. His stunning personality gave us an amazing welcome and made us fee like in fairy tale, with his stories, his interests and"
50,"We stayed at Tabachin for five nights in late Sept and had an absolutely brilliant time. We asked for the top floor penthouse and we were delighted with the room- it occupies the whole floor, with lovely decks and a stunning view of Zicatela and the boat harbor. Beautiful sunsets on the balcony, lovely breakfasts, entertaining conversations with Paul who is a very polished and genuine innkeeper and who has lived in Mexico for over 30 years, peace and quiet and only a short walk from the beach and local restaurants.  We give the Tabachin, Paul and his very nice staff a big five stars and would definitely stay here again."
50,"We stopped at Tabachin for 4 nights during our recent honeymoon. As it was the low season (september) we were given both a low season rate (30% off), and a free upgrade to the penthouse as it was free. This is the kind of hospitality you can expect from Paul, the owner, and his helpful staff of locals. Paul has a wealth of historical and local knowledge too, so can help with organising local trips or just orientation. Complementary breakfasts are varied and delicious, made with local produce and served in a shaded courtyard at a time and pace to suit you.   We found Tabachin as it was named in the rough guide, and we would certainly visit again. All taxi drivers know where it is too (it's one of the most well established places in puerto), making it very easy to find, organise"
50,"We stayed at Tabachin for 4 nights last week and it was the perfect way to wrap up our trip to Mexico.  The owner, Paul, is such an incredibly friendly host.  He ate breakfast and engaged in rousing discussions with us each morning (more on breakfast below), upgraded our room from a small to large studio for free because the larger room was empty, gave me a historical map of his to keep based on a discussion we had about the Mexican American War, and arranged to have his driver take us to the airport so we wouldn't have to pay for a cab.  His and the other staff members' hospitality is what makes Hotel Tabachin a standout place to stay.  The other great things about Tabachin: -Less than a 5 minute walk to Playa Zicatela and all the restaurants and bars there -It's on the west"
50,"We stayed for 2 weeks at Tabachin and were not disappointed. The position just off the busy Zicatela strip is perfect, close to the action but still quiet at night. The rooms are spacious and breezy. Views from the balcony and roof are excellent. Highlights are the breakfasts and the conversations with the owner Paul who we now call a good friend. We look forward to staying at Tabchin again."
50,"It's been quite a while since I have stayed at this lovely, small hotel but keep in contact with the owner, Paul once in a while. My girlfriend and I stayed at this amazing oasisl for two weeks in one of the beautiful roof-top suites with wrap-around deck facing the sea.  Everything was top notch including the morning breakfasts served in the shady and cool courtyard where you can eat to your heart's content.  Paul is the perfect host and as we had no car, he kindly took us grocery shopping and for a little tour to get our bearings when we first arrived.  We met so many friendly people in this town.  The food, music and camaraderie of PE must be experienced to be believed.  I must go back."
40,"My friend and I just returned from staying at the Villas a few days.  The Villas are lovely with a beautiful view of the beach.  At night we heard the crashing of those very large waves below.  You can walk down to the beach or take a short cab ride to other beachs (our favorite was La Cariziallio - a small, cove beach with warm, calm, torquise water.)  Keep in mind, you will feel a bit like you're in the middle of nowhere here - you're in the middle of neighborhood - there are literally goats being herded behind the hotel and chickens all around- so you will get a very authentic Mexican experience - not touristy at all.   If you want to be in town and walking distance to bars, etc - this is not your place. You can cook dinner in the rooms - or go out (but you'll need to call a"
50,"Unbelievable location on the cliffs above the main surf beach. 5 Min walk to the beach. The view is incredible! Rooms are beautifully done out - I had the top room with HUGE balcony. Very private and safe! - You don't actually need to leave the Casa, but I would recommend a scooter to get around for the super market etc! - Love it here and am thinking about how I can return. Excellent hostess and I highly recommend this place!!"
50,"I took my husband to Villa Casanuna to celebrate his 30th b-day a couple of weeks ago for five days. We loved the place so much that we ended up having more than just a b-day celebration, WE HAD A SECOND HONEY MOON!  Even since we arrived at the airport we were welcome by the warmest and friendliest person in Puerto Escondido, Cristina, the owner of Casanuna. Cristina, who is very knowledgeable of Puerto Escondido and its surroundings, gave us the best advice in relation to fun activities and even drove us to beautiful beaches such as Carrizalillo Beach.  The view from our room in the penthouse was just amazing; the service and amenities of Casanuna deserve to be rated ""five stars"" Honestly it was really hard to come back home, we can live in Villa Casanuna forever! Thank you"
50,"Casanuna is my favorite vacation destination! The views are phenomenal.  This is a wonderful place for relaxation, a romantic get a way, or someone looking for an adventure.    Casanuna is a hidden treasure that I consider myself lucky to have experienced, and I know you will leave feeling exactly the same!"
50,"Wow.  This place was perfect for what we needed.  We met up with our friends that had a 2 and a half year old.  They rented a place in town with no pool, so they spent most of their time with us.  It was great.   They came over every day and while  Oliver-the baby slept- we played pool, darts, poker, ping pong and swam in the pool.  All of these activities are provided at Casa Nuna at the Besame Mucho suite.     Casa Nuna is  a large house that can be rented entirely if you wish or you can rent it by section.  The best part is Besme Mucho which is the section with all of the activities listed above plus your own full kitchen.  We had a maid every day and a cook if we wanted.  She made us breakfast everyday and dinner a few times. The view is killer FYI....and you have high"
50,"Cristina and Randy were great hosts. They know alot about Puerto Escondido, and the surrounding area. A day trip is a good idea, as is a surf lesson although,  don't feel guilty if you don't make it past the pool. This is the best place to relax ever."
50,"Loved Casanuna!  The sweeping ocean view from our balcony was gorgeous.  The suite Besame Mucho was 5 star.  The service, the amenities, the garden, all tops.  thanks Randy and Cristina for a great week. Kathy & Roger"
40,My wife and I stayed at Casanuna with our two teenagers.  It was fabulous.  The host and hostess were very accommodating and Puerto Escondido was very cool.  A chance for an authentic Mexican visit.  We were able to walk to the beach and saw some of the greatest surfers you will ever see.  My two kids from the mid-west took surfing lessons in Carrizallilo from a wonderful local.  My kids immediately wanted to move to the beach.  The restaurants were very reasonable and the casual atmosphere made it very fun.  I recommend the stay.
50,"I hadn't been to Puerto since the early 70's & have to say a very pleasant surprise awaited us. Puerto Escondido is truly an International destination as is most of the State of Oaxaca. The excellent restaurantes in Puerto, the beaches, side trips, the convenience of the International Airport to the town itself all make this an ideal locale to spend time. With regards to Casanuna, we felt at home immediately, immaculate rooms, a ten minute walk to the beach & just incredible views as the sun dips from Casanuna. Very reasonable rates for a first class facility as well. Next time, I'll stay a month."
50,Beautiful place. Great rooms. Kid friendly. We booked for a week and ended up staying for a month. Out of the main hassle with beautiful views over the beach and ocean.
50,"Amazing team, fantastic experience. People with good Heart. Happy humains and very good teachers. The place to stay is a Beauty and even if I got myself in deep ****, couldnt forget how lucky i was.  Thank you so Much!   Gabrielle"
50,Puerto Surf was amazing! We loved La Punta and staying close to the beach. The surf classes were so fun and the coaches were great. It was really fun meeting other travelers taking lessons and staying at Puerto Surf. I highly recomend this place and hope to go back in the next few years!
50,"It's just round the corner from La Punta beach but just set back from the main strip of restaurants, so close but on the doorstep. The gardens are really beautiful and very peaceful for relaxing in. The staff are all super sweet and helpful. I would certainly come back here!"
50,"Swantje and David have created an incredible little surf oasis. The grounds are beautiful and lush, the rooms nice and clean and the vibe is very familiar and relaxed. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, the surf instructors are great and know how to work with any skill level and my Spanish teach Elouisa was incredible too. I enjoyed my week at Puerto Surf very much and hope to return soon"
50,"I stayed with them for two weeks and it was a very nice and pleasant stay! The room was big and clean and the property quiet, the location is also amazing as it is right at the end of La Punta and in front of the waves. I took many surf lessons with two different instructors and both of them were really great and friendly. They gave me good advices to help me how to read the waves and improve my surfing, and I improved a lot in two weeks! I would absolutely recommend surfing and staying with them!"
20,"My wife and I stayed here for a few nights.  We had a small portion of our honeymoon set aside for Puerto Escondido so we could do some surfing.  We live in Hawaii, and figured we are used to the heat, but apparently we traveled to Puerto about the hottest time of the year.  Whew.  Sweaty, and almost nowhere in La Punta has AC, including Puerto Surf House.  We can work around that though.  The property was cute, room was clean, plumbing in bathroom was kind of funny because the S-trap in the sink didn't make a full ""S"".  I don't want to get too into it, and I usually don't spend my time writing reviews, but I think this needs to be said.  We were immediately asked if we needed surf ""lessons"".  We turned down the offer from a nice instructor there.  The next day I talked with"
50,"I stayed with Puerto Surf for almost two weeks in June. It is brilliantly located at the edge of La Punta, a hippie-ish area of Zicatela beach just 50 meters from the beach and the wave itself. They have a beautiful garden where you could watch the hummingbirds from a hammock in between surf sessions. Magical! David and Swantje were beautiful hosts and made me feel incredibly welcome.  I took a few lessons with them as well, and I must say this is one of the most professionally run outfits I've seen. They really have excellent instructors who want you to get the most out of your time in the water. Chucho (Jesus) in particular - we had such amazing chemistry and I learned a lot from him. As an intermediate surfer he made sure to push me a little to go for the bigger waves and was"
50,"It was our first time standing on a surf board and we had an excellent time.  The guides take much care about every individual student, give good advices and the necessary help. The equipment is in very good conditions.  Thank you for the good experience !"
50,"I spend close to two weeks at the house and loved it. Very relaxed and quite yet only 1min away from the beach and all restaurants. La Punta is still super relaxed as is the vibe at the house. I loved the lessons, the atmosphere and la Punta in general."
40,"Spent 5 days, 6 nights at Puerto Surf.  Surfed, made friends, laughed, relaxed and surfed again.  The surf instructors  get you ready for the waves in record time. Straightforward instructions, practice on the beach, and off you go, standing up before you could even realize what's going on.  Plus, they're super fun to hang out with.  Rooms are comfortable, yet don't expect a five-star suite here.  This is a surf camp, with surf lifestyle.  However, lying back in your hammock with Signorita Gata at lying at your side on a hot afternoon, after a well deserved brunch, is pretty close to what I could call paradise.  Thanks for the memories and the laughters, I will definitely be back.  Hasta luego!"
50,"My daughter and I have been coming here for twenty years and have stayed at the Flor de Maria countless times. The hosts, Joanne & Paul, are just the nicest people on earth, warm, welcoming and wonderful.   The rooms are simple but nice, and after all, you're out all day at the beach or on a day trip. Jo & Paul are extremely knowledgeable about the area and are always there with information and suggestions.  The staff is also fabulous, just a very nice group of people who have all worked there for many years and do their jobs very well.  The hotel is always spotless clean and well-maintained, and any issues are dealt with immediately.  When the restaurant is open, Nov-April, it's the most popular dinner place in town.  Joanne was chef-owner of a highly rated restaurant in"
50,"The Flor de Maria is the friendliest, most comfortable place to stay in Puerto Escondido, perhaps in all of Mexico! After seeing a picture of it 18 years ago, I decided to pay a visit and fell in love with the place immediately. It's why I've been back almost every year since, and why most of the other guests in January and February are also people who've been coming for decades. You could say we're all family now, including the maids and restaurant and bar staff and night watchman who greet us every year with arms extended and wide grins and who work so hard to make each day a perfect one. The rooms are large and spotlessly clean, the food is wonderful, the roof-top-pool-cum-bar-cum- hammock area offers unbeatable sunsets every night, which we toast with the best margaritas in"
50,"We are return customers for over a decade to our dear Hotel Flor de Maria. Joanne and Paul are gracious hosts who make us feel as though we are their family. Our visit always begins with a delicious meal at the hotel restaurant that features fresh, creative cuisine and attentive service. We spend afternoons on the rooftop  terrace where there is a bar offering mixed drinks, beer and wine, and light fare. A swim in the terrace pool after a day at the beach is always a refreshing delight. Our room (two double beds, private bath, free wifi, and ceiling fan) is  comfortable and restful. Each room also features wall paintings of flowers, birds, and seascapes. In the colonial style all rooms surround a lovely garden. The staff at Flor are capable and accommodating, always greeting us"
50,"We enjoyed every minute of our four-night stay at Flor de Maria in March 2017. The room was nice and clean and charming with painted doors and decor. The rooms are on two levels facing a central atrium and all floors are rustic tile. I don't think there are ocean views from any rooms, but There is a top floor large deck with hammocks and tables and chairs, with sunny and shady spaces. There is a bar there too, with an attendant. Margaritas were good! The deck has expansive views of the beach and ocean, and is nice for hanging out for hours. The proprietors, Joanne and Paul, are energetic and friendly and willing to chat or help if needed. They are English speaking and the clientele is primarily English speaking. One of us needed ice for an injured knee and proprietors frequently"
40,The owners run the hotel and are very helpful and want to ensure you have a great dining experience. Our group of 4 dined there twice and both times the food was great. We had fish both times and it  was very fresh and delicious.They also had a good selection of wine. They both spoke English.
40,"I was referred to this hotel for dinner and I was really pleased with the food. It was so good I ate there twice. Joanne the owner was a very pleasant women. She makes sure to introduce herself to every table, ask you how everything is. The staff is just as friendly. The waiters do a great job as well. Obviously trained well. They serve you and allow you to eat your meal but also keep a eye on you if you need anything else. This is a must eat at restaurant if your going to Puerto Escondido."
50,"My friend and I recently enjoyed a few lovely days at Hote Flor de Maria. From the moment I made the reservation until they gave me a hug good-bye, Joanne and Paul were extremely responsive and accommodating and unfailingly polite and helpful.  Their staff, all of whom have been with them for many years, are similarly friendly, helpful, and polite. The hotel is quiet, clean, simple, and charming. The food is tasty and has a lot of variety with a vegetarian option at each meal. The rooftop terrace has a pool with a small bar and hammocks, lounge chairs and wicker sofas and lots of shade.There is usually and light breeze and gorgeous views of the sunsets. Lots of guests, visit yearly, so that is a high recommendation. We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Flor de Maria."
50,"I hate telling people about this as I'd love to keep it to myself, but it is too good to not share. The hotel is on Marinero Beach - a good swimming beach - and is just a short walk from it.  The rooms are large with hot water, safety boxes, good beds, ceiling fans and bathrooms. There is a lovely roof top small restaurant and a lovely pool which is the ideal place to catch the sunsets.  The restaurant downstairs is excellent also. There is internet throughout the hotel and free parking also. The owners, Paul and Joanne will help with whatever you need and the staff is friendly and efficient. The area is quiet yet you are close enough to walk to the downtown should you want.  We have been here 3 times and have never been disappointed.  A lovely experience."
50,"I had an amazing vacation in Puerto Escondido, mostly thanks to the hosts, Joanne and Paul.   I was meeting a cousin who had friends in Pto Escondido and she was staying elsewhere. I needed a hotel close to the Marinero beach and to Sabor a Mar since I had knee problems. Flor de Maria was close to a perfect choice. About a ten to fifteen minute walk on the beach (with my bad knees), then spending most of my days at Sabor a Mar enjoying the sun, the breeze, the water and guacamole under an umbrella.   Joanne and Paul are marvellous hosts, making sure they provided anything I needed, like an extra fan because there is no A/C (the absolute only drawback for me) or calling for a taxi when I wanted to go to the Adoquin or to town. The food is excellent, prepared under Joanne's"
40,"Spent 10 days at this property, we had a corner unit on the main floor, large room, view of the ocean, quiet and comfortable. The owners were a lot of fun, the food was fabulous and everything was very clean. Highly recommended, felt safe and welcome."
50,"My husband and I just returned from a perfect week at beautiful Gecko Rock Resort.  This place is a wonderful choice for a romantic, intimate and/or just relaxing vacation!  It is small, so your experience is enhanced by the fact that you don't have to deal with a place full of noisy people.  In fact, the 7 of us filled the resort to capacity (there are 4 casitas) so we were the only ones there!  It is perfect for a family get together or, as was the case with us, a small gathering of friends. The owners are a husband and wife team who are always available for anything that is needed.  The price includes all of your meals, which are deliciously prepared by the owner!  I am not an adventurous eater and I loved absolutely everything!  The location can't be beat either - the"
50,"This was the first resort I have ever chosen and it was a great choice! My partner and I spent seven days here and plan to return. Super relaxing, no cars, sirens, airplanes, only the sound of the surf. The food was excellent! Aileen the co-owner is a fabulous cook (and person). We did not have a meal that we didn't like. The bed was large and comfortable, the rooms were cleaned often (every other day) and there were snacks available between meals. The pool was clean and refreshing.    The owners were always available to answer any questions that we might have. This resort was made for relaxation. The location was private (in the country). There are some small restaurants in the nearby small town of Agua Blanca. The rooftop terrace with hammock and chairs are not to be missed!"
50,"This review is way over due, this place is amazing! Gecko Rock was everything I hoped it would be and MORE! After exhaustive research into this area of Mexico, Gecko Rock was the far and way winner for a get away with my husband (who only knew to get on the plane to Mexico City, he had zero idea of where I was taking us).   From the beginning with email conversations Mike was quick to respond and a wealth of information about the area and things to do while we were there. After getting wind of a turtle hatching event that would occur during our stay, Mike kindly reached out to ask if we were interested (um YES!) and added it to our itinerary. Talking with Mike put me at ease with traveling to a part of Mexico I had never even previously considered visiting. Mike also arranged"
50,"My husband and I visited southern Oaxaca for the first time and we stayed 6 days at Gecko Rock Resort. The first thing we noticed was that the resort is secluded. We basically had a private beach just a 2 minute walk away. The beach is beautiful; no trash, no people selling trinkets, no loud music.  The food at Gecko Rock is spectacular. Aileen's international experiences shine through her beautifully prepared, fresh, meals. We had fresh fruit juices too!  Mike helped us create a plan for our activities and since he knows the area so well we had some lovely experiences. We went snorkeling, surfing, and we got to see a nature preserve.   The resort has only 4 rooms so the guest list is always small. It made it feel even more private and secluded; perfect for relaxation. I can't"
50,"My husband and I went to Gecko Rock Resort with 5 other friends.  Our normal vacation is jam packed with activities, but we were looking forward to some serious down time on this trip.  This place is fantastic…the workmanship and attention to detail on the landscaping and buildings is all top notch!  Our first day there, I got a WONDERFUL margarita and afterward walked 5 minutes to the beach. The water was beautiful and the beach was empty…just my friends and me.  The atmosphere is so laid back and homey…our group spent most of the days lounging by the pool or hanging out under the palapa, drinking margaritas and eating some of the most delicious world cuisine I’ve ever tasted!  There are a few food items that aren’t my favorite (eggs, mushrooms), but the owners had no issues"
50,"In one word…outstanding!  The owner/operators arranged for transportation from the airport to the resort and were there to meet us when we arrived.  As you arrive and see all the trees, the palapa, the pool and the casitas, you instantly know it’s going to be an amazing experience.  The casitas are extremely clean and well-designed. The in-room AC units and bathrooms create a ""Western"" hotel experience that match any US resort.  There are a couple hammocks near the pool and another on each rooftop patio…It’s impossible to not nap in them after lunch and a swim.  Speaking of lunch…the food is off-the-charts delicious. The owners sent us a questionnaire before our trip to learn about our tastes, likes/dislikes, allergies, etc. We learned that the menus were inspired by the owners’"
50,"Gecko Rock Resort is the best boutique resort I have ever visited.  Remote, lush and serene Gecko Rock is the perfect place to relax and truly enjoy life!  A small group of us trekked to this beautiful resort in November.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by the proprietors Mike and Aileen.  So sweet and accommodating, they created an environment and experience that is unique and memorable.  Once we all got settled into our cute, well-appointed rooms (with private rooftop and hammock), Aileen prepared lunch—an out of this world Bi Bim Bob, a Korean rice dish.  Yes, three meals a day is part of the package and every meal was delicious and perfectly executed.  But more about that in a minute.  After lunch, I took a walk around the resort and then to the beach, which is about 100"
50,"Mike and Aileen's small, intimate resort has the perfect atmosphere for tranquil relaxation.  With a maximum of 8 guests at the resort at any time, a beautiful and clean pool to relax in, your own private rooftop hammock with ocean view, and a 2 minute walk to the ocean... you just can't beat it.  Aileen prepares great food based on your preferences from the survey you fill out before your arrival so you can count on great and interesting food that you'll love.  Mike and Aileen clearly value giving the best service to make sure each guest is happy and has a great experience. During our week we chose to fill a few days with some mini adventures in Puerto Escondido, 20 miles away.  We had an amazing time scuba diving, snorkeling, exploring the town and local market, and enjoying"
50,"This resort allows you to truly relax, the amazing location, the rooms, the facilities and the superb service, mean that you do not have to worry or think about anything. I loved every minute and was incredibly sad to leave.   This is a resort that you will be thinking about coming back to again and again. The food is amazing! You look forward to each meal as you know it will be so delicious. The beach is just there, you can explore the coastline or just sit and chill on beautiful sand, no crowds - watching the sun set. The rooms are very comfortable, but most of all I loved hanging out in my hammock, looking out over the ocean and the swimming pool, thinking… “How lucky am I to be here?""  Mike and Aileen are just wonderful hosts with some amazing suggestions - that boat tour"
50,"This place is located in paradise.  Getting to the resort from Seattle was a bit of an adventure, but once you get there you don't want to leave.  The resort has access to miles of beautiful sandy beaches.  You can walk 10 minutes down the beach to a few local bars and restaurants or you can just sit tight in paradise.  Mike and Aileen built this boutique resort from the ground up.  There was a lot of thought on the various amenities and they are appreciated by the guests.    Aileen is an amazing chef.  She prepares these amazing meals from fresh ingredients located at the various markets and grown on site.  Her style is very fusion oriented. Every meal was a hit and we probably experienced a number of favorite meals of all time.  Truly a foodies dream!  Mike mans the blender"
50,"I always have an excellent dinner here....I feel they excel at dinner.   One of the best in Puerto Escondido, they accept credit cards. Delicious!!!   Great filet minion and dessert. Fantastic vegetables and potatoes  "
40,"Family owned and run beach front hotel at the zicatela.   Safe parking and directly on spot in Puerto Escondido.  The rooms are well maintained, clean and have a personal touch as well as air conditioning.  There is a pool at the yard and a nice open restaurant next to it.  The restaurant claims to serve the best steaks in town as the owner introduced his German knowledge on controlled aging of beef. Successfully, in deed.  Needless to say that Hotel Ines seems to be a focal point of the German expat and/or tourist community. (but without the reservation-by-towel practice so often associated with German tourists :-))"
50,"We had two very lovely meals at this Hotel.  It was more fine dining as the prices were a little higher but the meals were superb.  They had a table big enough to seat 10 of us.  Our waiter, Fabian, was great and we really appreciated his humour and attentiveness.  I chose to have our last dinner with our friends at this same restaurant again.  It was truly enjoyable!"
40,"Spent a lot of time researching where to stay in Puerto Escondido and am certain we picked the right place.  Hotel Ines has a great location, right in the center of Zicatela (all hotels are across the small street).  Booked directly through the hotel, Blanca was very prompt in responding.  We had room 204, 2 beds facing the ocean.  Balcony with a table and 2 chairs was great for sitting outside in the morning or watching the awesome sunset at night.  Our room had a safe, fridge, air conditioning  (not all rooms do).  Hot water was instant and water pressure was great.  Only funky thing was the window to the bathroom was in the shower, not frosted, and louvered.  I'm sure any person who was somewhat tall could see right in.  Bed was probably the most comfortable bed I've ever"
40,"Three of us stayed twice at this hotel. Each time we were greeted nicely by the receptionist. Our rooms, both times triples with three beds, were clean and modestly decorated. Each had a balcony overlooking the pool and with a little view of the beach (Room 200 our favorite). The location of the hotel is great, right across the street from the beach and close to everything. Unfortunately, on our first visit, the air conditioning did not work and we had to change rooms, otherwise the rating would be 5 stars."
40,"Our second stay at Hotel Ines was as pleasant, if not more, than our first. Ines has a quiet, laid-back atmosphere and helpful staff. Rooms are not opulent but they are comfortable and very clean. The location is great. Playa Zicatela is a fun place to relax and join the ebb and flow of people through the day. You can grab a coffee at Cafecito steps down the street (open at 6 AM) and enjoy sunrise on the beach or walk across the street for sunset. It's easy to walk up to the main road and hop on a collectivo to the market, and you can get a taxi into town for dinner in front of the hotel.  We'll look forward to our next visit."
50,Such a relaxing atmosphere.  Beautiful view of the ocean and a nice pool to cool off in.  The restaurant is amazing.  Staff are friendly and courteous.  A great place for a relaxing Mexican vacation.  Puerto Escondido is a great choice if you want a vacation without all of the tourism hoopla.  Hotel Ines should be your only choice for accommodations.
40,"First keep in mind that this hotel is located in a very popular surf spot. The area is not populated with resort style hotels and still has a very local feel. Most of the staff are very friendly and the property is decently maintained. Internet is free but only works by the restaurant/pool area. There is security all night. There are rooms available off the main street but we requested a room with an ocean view facing the main street (we started and finished each day on the balcony, it was very nice though there is noise). The rooms are clean but are showing use and age. Beds are hard but not horrible and everything worked well. There is AC, no ceiling fan but a portable fan was provided in the room. Only real disappointment was the lack of a coffee maker at the price point of"
50,"OK, so you walk into this circa 1950s layout with the restaurant poolside. One of the higher priced restaurants in town but well worth it (although less than half what you would pay for in an equivalent US restaurant). Best shrimps fried in garlic oil i've tasted anywhere. One of the best steak places in Puerto as well (but do not expect Morton's quality beef). Another night we had the fresh fish caught that day, and deliciously prepared with a choice of sauces (one better than the other). Service was very friendly, prompt and bilingual. Fair warning; customs do bring their dogs."
40,"we were a walk in off the street. They had rooms available so we stayed. The rooms are in need of updating but they very clean. I slept well on the mattress, pillows were to my liking. One firm and one medium. Instant hot water which is scarce in my. You have control of your own AC which was nice. My room came with a small patio with table and chairs. Staff was very friendly and polite. They have rooms from $25.00 us a night to $95.00 a night. Nice pool area with both sun and shade areas. In front of the pool they have a couple hamicks, tables to play cards on, lounge chairs to chill and read a book in. It was quiet around the pool, everyone was very friendly. Those that stay there for a extended time will introduce themselves to you. They have a dive shop on property. The"
40,"Hotel Santa Fe was just what we expected, relaxing and comfortable - we felt like we were at a retreat. The staff was unobtrusive and accommodating although perhaps a bit tourist-weary. Unlike a few other reviewers, we had no unexpected charges and were very clear about cost when we booked. Since Santa Fe is at the western end of Zicatela Beach and around the corner from the town beach, it's an excellent location if you enjoy walking and want to be a bit off the beaten path and not sleeping next to surfers who may stay up all night partying. Yes, we did notice a few roaches and other insects and the a/c and ceiling fans were a little noisy, but this is not Cabo San Lucas! Part of the reason we spent the extra money to fly to Puerto is because it's off the beaten track and"
30,"After reading so  many great reviews I was really disappointed with this hotel. The staff did not seem to care at all with the problems we encountered. Major issues: roaches in the room! towels and sheets with holes, air conditioning hardly functioning but making more noise than an airplane on take off. They actually had the audacity to charge for pool towels which were also old and threadbare. I refused.   There are some good things: the location is in between the surfers beach and the downtown street. The pool area is nice. The restaurant is very good but of course more expensive than all other restaurants in town.   Now if this hotel would be half the price and the manager and staff would change their attitude... "
30,"The Santa Fe could be a great hotel, but it is not. The location is very good, and some of the facilities, such as the pool and the terrace that surrounds it, are beautiful. But the hotel management behaves as if it is renting out the Taj Mahal.  Look out for semi-secret charges if you ask for beach towels more than once. Come prepared with industrial strength ear plugs to avoid becoming deaf from the roar of the decades-old air conditioner and fans that sound like a jet propeller over your head. Look out for bugs in your room, and beware of laundry charges that are not stated and remain amazingly vague even after you ask what they are. And, yes, the bedsheets covering the ancient mattresses all have holes in them.   This hotel would be just right at half the price. The"
40,"We spent a week at the Hotel Santa Fe with no agenda other than relaxing and watching a few sunsets. The hotel exceeded our expectations in almost every way. Our room had a king bed, a large bathroom and a small balcony. While the A/C was a bit loud, it was effective and in reality, with the ceiling fan and the nice cross breeze we didn't really need it, except in the middle of the day if we wanted to take a siesta. We didn't notice too many bugs other than a few ants here and there. The grounds,landscaping and architecture are characteristically Spanish colonial and well maintained. The restaurant serves seafood and vegetarian dishes including many local and Mexican specialties. We sampled all of the vegetarian dishes and they were all excellent. The fruits and vegetables were"
50,"Sometimes you just can't believe your good fortune when you find a hotel that is gorgeous, upscale, quiet, and a super deal.  Not to mention the restaurant, which was the best food we had on our month long trip in Mexico.  And what a location and view!  The hotel sits on Zicateli Beach, which is where surfers hang.  You can't swim on this beach, too dangerous, but the crashing huge waves made walking this beach a treat several times a day.  It's really incredible.  The hotel has big rooms, two pools, a sea deck overlooking the beach where you can hang and read, relax, etc.  If you want to swim in the ocean, you can go further down and swim and snorkel.  We will definitely be back here."
30,"We just returned from Puerto at the beginning of December, after spending a week at the Hotel Santa Fe. The hotel's location is excellent- just across the street from Playa Zicatela and very close to some great little breakfast places. The grounds are truly lovely and the pools are well-maintained. The atmosphere is tranquil and appeals to a wide variety of travelers. The views of the spectacular Puerto sunsets are amazing. The food at the restaurant was above average, both in quality and price. Expect good food, but expect to pay nearly double for drinks, etc... than at other nearby, nice little restaurants. Our room was spacious. The bathroom was huge and there was always plenty of hot water, towels, etc...  However, after all of the positive aspects I ended up rating this"
40,"Enjoyed it.   Friendly.  Well located.   Overall, not much negative to say about it except for the fact the nearby military base bugler will likely wake you up just before sunrise if you leave your windows open (which is ok if you like waking up to enjoy the morning).   Although not expensive by most standards, it was more expensive than other nearby hotels.  Food was good, and the hotel has the best coffee we found in town. "
40,"My wife and I just returned from a wonderful, one-week stay at the Hotel Santa Fe. WeÂ re in our twenties, have traveled extensively and stayed at our fare share of hotels. We have generally enjoyed comfortable, urbane hotels rather than rugged, sporting/adventure travel and so the Santa Fe was a good match.The GoodÂ . The hotel is on the point between Playa Principal (the calmer, safer for swimming beach with mobs of kids and families) and Playa Zicatela (the surferÂ s haven with mesmerizingly large waves and a correspondingly wicked undertow). With Principal literally at the hotelÂ s front door and Zicatela around the corner, the beach-front options could not be better; more secluded beaches such as La Punta or Carrizalillo are either a long walk or a very short taxi ride"
40,"Just returned from Puerto Escondido November 1st. My husband and I took my parents who are both in their 70's and had never been out of the USA. We arrived in Escondido on a Saturday afternoon. We were told the hotel would have someone there waiting for us. After looking around we figured out it was just the local tour and travel people that pick up everyone and take them where they want to go, not the hotel staff.  After arriving we were shown to our rooms. We each had a suite for 171.00 a night cause it was off season. Not really what we expected for that much money. The furniture and view are both nice, but the tv offers 3 channels and you have to cross a sometimes busy road to get to the Ocean. The bathroom had a whirlpool tub but its unusable unless you like cold baths."
40,Hotel Santa Fe is perfect for those looking to relax just a short walk from town. It's also beachfront and very romantic.  You get the feeling of a little Mexican pueblo. Loved it!
50,Adelina her husband and the team at Villa Lili make for a magical experience. Nothing is too much trouble and they will assist with bookings and advice to make the most of the area. The hotel is cute and the rooms are comfortable and well cared for.  Not only is the hotel and pool area perfect they offer a bar (with an honesty system) and the breakfasts are wonderful  Second time staying there and we would definitely come back here again.  
50,"I had the best few nights at Villa Lili and at the second property Quinta Lili. I cannot recommend the Villas enough. Adeiva and her family were so welcoming from the second I arrived. I was travelling alone so it was lovely to feel part of the family. All the guests were so lovely too! It was the people that made my holiday!  There are only a few rooms so you know you will be well taken care of here.  The breakfast was amazing, unfortunately I was out most mornings so only managed to have it once! It is cooked for you especially, and you have plenty of fruit and coffee whilst you wait.  The location is great too, right next to Benito Juarez with plenty of food options, a convenience store with a cash machine, beauticians, and tourist information. It is also right next to"
50,"I had the best time at Villa Lili! We stayed for 5 nights in January and it was perfect.  It is an easy walk to Playa Carrizaililo, we had the most delicious breakfasts every morning cooked by Rosie.  This is hands down the best place to stay.  The pool was so beautiful to swim in when weren't at the beach.  Adeina was so accommodating though out the entire stay.  She helped us book tours, she taught us how to make mole and ceviche, and when my husband hurt his foot, her father helped drive me to the pharmacy for medicine.  They were so welcoming and truly treated us like family.  So many of the other  hotel guests come year after year to villa lili because they love it there so much.  If you are lucky enough to get a room here, BOOK IT.  It is truly the best place to stay."
50,"My family and I stayed at Villa Lili for 7 nights in mid-August. We loved everything about this beautiful, cozy boutique hotel and loved the owner, Adelina (and her beautiful son Moritz). Adelina (and Rosie and Magda) made sure we were able to do things all things we wanted in Puerto - kids’ surf lessons, swimming with dolphins, bioluminescence bay, and more. Adelina made everything so easy. I just had to tell what we wanted to do - and it was arranged! Adelina and her staff also made sure our kids were content. Adelina asked about their food preferences for breakfast, provided suggestions on where they might like to eat, and generally checked in to make sure they were having a good time. We were lucky to have Adelina and as a host and guide. I hope we can go back soon!"
50,"Our stay at Villa Lili made our time in Puerto Escondido extra special! Villa Lili is in a great location - only a few minutes walk to one of the best beaches and great places to eat. Our room and the entire place is very comfortable and clean, but what makes this place a gem is Adelina and the friendly staff that work there. It was such a great experience to interact with Adelina and her son over breakfast each morning - which was different and delicious every day!   Adelina went above and beyond her host duties when she helped take care of my boyfriend who was quite unwell for a couple of days. She even took us to the airport when it was time to leave. We’re so grateful for your care in making our trip to Puerto Escondido a memorable one. Thank you Adelina and the lovely staff"
50,"I was originally booked for Quinta Lilli, the sister hotel.  Since it was a bit slow, Adelina offered to upgrade me to Villa Lili.  The room was very clean and spacious.  Breakfast was always delicious and fresh.  It was so nice to be able to rinse off and jump in the pool for an evening swim after a long beach day at Carizalillo.  Just a short walk to the beach and steps from restaurants, Villa Lili was an ideal place to stay for some solid beach time.  Adelina and her cute son were very welcoming and accommodating."
50,"My family and I stayed at Villa Lili for 10 nights in December 2017 and we didn’t want to leave. My boys (7 year old twins and 10 year old) still bring up “puerto Escondido” and our stay at villa lili, as their favourite destination, when we talk about our recent holiday to USA and Mexico.  Every morning Rosie made us the most divine home cooked breakfasts. Our room, the pool and outdoor areas were fabulous and our hosts Adelina and Alex went out of their way to help us settle into life in puerto.  Thank you Adelina and Alex for our most memorable family holiday to date. The boys can’t wait to visit Moritz again! We will definitely be returning! Colleen and family from Melbourne, Australia "
50,"My husband and I had an excellent 5-night stay at Villa Lili at the end of March. We stayed in the top master suite. The room was very comfortable and clean. There was an excellent view of the ocean and of the town of Puerto from the room. Without knowing it ahead of time, our 5 nights fell during Semana Santa when the normally sleepy Carrizalillo area gets a little wild with Mexican tourists. Our sweet little room got a little noisy at night because the music from the main strip wafted right into our windows. We were able to sleep, but it did require ear plugs. This seems to be just an issue with the top room, and specifically for the busy week were were there. We spoke to other guests staying in other rooms who did not hear a peep of sound. So, just a word of warning if you"
50,"This February I was staying for two weeks at Villa Lili with my wife. We had the Exotica master suite that is a gorgeous space with a jacuzzi tub and with a pretty good ocean view at the horizon from the balcony. The room and the rest of Villa Lili was kept very clean and the overall hotel environment felt homelike and friendly.  Usually we started our day with couple hours walking along the Bacocho Beach, swimming and coming back to Villa Lili for the breakfast that was always delicious. Later on there was also a good choice of restaurants for lunch and dinner at the walking distance or just 5-10 minutes of taxi ride to elsewhere in the town.   The hotel’s front yard was also a great space to hang out with the other gests of to have some quiet time if required. It includes"
50,"We stayed 4 nights at Villa Lili in early March.  Location is great, 1 block from restaurants and stores, 10 minute walk to Playa Carilazillo, a protected cove type beach with both swimming/ snorkeling and surfing.  And of course a short inexpensive cab ride from all that PE offers.  The service was great and staff were delightful, the rooms and the property impeccably up-kept and clean.  the owner Adelina was very gracious and accommodating.  The hotel is like a private oasis behind high walls, the common area with honor bar, kitchen/breakfast area, lounge chairs and palapas and the lap pool was wonderful and never crowded or noisy.  It feels like you are guests at a very artsy/funky yet luxurious private home.  As some reviewers noted, this is more like a B&B, do not expect"
50,I stayed two weekends at Casa Kei. Nice hosting and a lot of waves very close to it. Nature and cool lifestyle together. The sunsets are amazing in Puerto and at Casa Kei has a really nice view to the sea. The waves are very close to go walking in the morning when the wind from the mountain creates the offshore wind that makes waves very fun.
50,"I stayed at casa kei for a month and it was by far the nicest place I stayed in out of several others. I wish I could have stayed for longer. I had the most beautiful room with views to the ocean and an incredible breeze...trust me this is a necessity in Puerto, a room with no breeze is like a prison there. I really felt at home there, Pepe is a great guy and a pleasure to live with. The location is great, you can run down to the waves every day at La Punta or easily catch a five peso collectivo from the highway."
50,"This is one of the best places I've stayed in Mexico. Within walking distance to everyrhing, tropical, lush garden with incredible camping spots and spectacular rooms with the best views. Casa Kei is an escape, an oasis, a retreat from the world but you are within walking distance of incredible, pristine coastline and delicious restaurants and great bars with the best cocktails and beers. "
50,"Cozy Tropical Paradise  I had a great time at Casa kei, It is located in La Punta Zicatela area, which is not very touristic.  I stayed  at the top cabaña where I could see awesome sunsets and of course check the waves There is a beautiful garden with some hammocks where you can relax from the heat."
50,"When arriving to Puerto Escondido for my first time, I took a taxi to Casa Kei thinking it was going to be near the main strip. Instead, it lead me to Brisas Zicatela, a much more tropical and communal neighborhood 3 blocks away from Punta Zicatela, the surfer's paradise. Pepe, the owner of Casa Kei, joyfully welcomed me into what was more than just a Casa. The land included a very traditional setting perfect for lounging or simply hearing the flora and fauna that surrounds you. I was situated in the room three floors above the rustic handmade house. The room was perfect. The palm tree-leaved roof, centered maca, and spectacular view of Punta Zicatela made my stay much more than what I asked for. Thumbs up to Pepe and Casa Kei! Will definitely return!"
50,"Casa Kei was a beautiful surprise. Tucked just above La Punta, I found myself in an oasis filled with fruit trees and colourful flowers. I pitched my tent on a sandy patch next to a hammock and just across a stoned path the outdoor common area was located. Living simply, Casa Kei seemed to have everything I needed including an outdoor shower (another shower is available if you prefer). Life seemed dreamy there and it was if time didn't exist.  A perfect place - I would highly  suggest this place to anyone who wants an authentic Oaxaca experience."
50,"I wanted to be on the beach and I was.  From the balcony, I could see the ocean.  It was a three minute walk to the beach.  At night I could hear the ocean waves.  The room was clean and quite.  The room cost around $25.  It came with hot water, drinking water, fan, a small frig and cable t.v."
50,"For us, this place was economically priced even by Mexican standards so we were a little wary.  However, the room was very clean and came with its own bathroom, fan, refrigerator and cable TV.  We had asked for a room with a sea view, which we had, together with a small balcony.  The accommodation area generally was well-kept and extremely good value. Just across a very quiet road and you are on Zicatela Beach watching the surfers.  10 minutes walk along the beach and you are around a small headland and onto Playa Principal where you can swim and bodyboard.  And there are numerous restaurants both on the beach and along the road. They are very strict on the checkout time of 11 o’clock which meant we paid for an extra day as our flight back home to Mexico City wasn’t until 4pm,"
40,"just fantistic!  The hotel is very clean and tastfull decorated. The waves are amazing for a great surf. And within a minute u are by the sea. We had a lot of fun. and the service was good!  For sure i will come back,and my friends think the same way. Also the area around had some beautifull places to go and see. And a lot of places around to eat for a small price some great mexican food."
40,"This is a great litte hotel right on the Zicatela Beach in Puerto Escondido.  The price was great also. $30 dollars a night for two persons for the room not the bungalows.  The room was very very clean with hot and cold running water, refrigerator, tv with cable, ceiling fan and air conditioner( the air conditoner did not work).  Some of the rooms have a kitchenette. We wil be staying there again in the future."
50,"great place ,loved my stay there for sure will go back,very cool people had the best time ever.the room whas super clean and nice taken care of.thanks to the owners to make my stay so comfortible "
50,i had a very good stay  it has been the cleanest place have have been in mexico nice people and took a nice surf lesson  lots of fun and a very pleasent stay 
50,"We were booked for Villa Lili, but there were problems with the water before we arrives, so thank goodness, Luis booked us into Quinta for our 4 night stay.  We had the too room with amazing views, lots of space and the ladies do amazing work at cleaning!  Rosie was so kind, and I really appreciated when her and Magda would try to help me speak Spanish.  Adelina, Moritz, and Luis, you made us feel very welcome and I thoroughly enjoyed your company, and hospitality.  The food that these ladies cook is absolutely delicious!  We would go to the gym before, come home starving and they were there to prepare our huge breakfast for us.    We spent some time in the pool, but mostly we were out and about visiting beaches and restaurants in the area.  And the Mercado... make sure that"
50,"Our stay at Quinta Lili was just perfect. Adelina and Magda are fantastic hosts. Breakfast was delicious and the rooms were very comfortable. This is just the sweetest hotel, near the best beach in Puerto Escondido. Adelina gives great recommendations of where to eat and what to do as well. I will be coming back again for sure, and I don't say that very often. Great value, great people, amazing place. Thank you <3"
50,"From the moment we stepped into the courtyard we felt at home.  Adelina, and Magda treated us like family.  We stayed on the top floor and had almost a 360 degree view.  We could see the ocean from our room and the loft with two lounge chairs was heavenly. We immediately connected with the other guests and feel as though we have made life-long friends.  The Mexican breakfast each morning was delicious.  Adelina was so helpful in arranging tours and transportation for us."
50,"Quinta Lili is small- only 5 rooms, I think- which makes it personable and really special. The location is good- a block from good restaurants, and a block from the nicest beach. The design is lovely- blue tile work, abalone shell, and Lillies carved into furniture. But what it makes it most special is the owner Ade and her staff. They’ve also started brewing a good beer, supplied to local restaurants, so be sure and try it out!"
50,"We stayed in this lovely home away from home for 20 days.  Each and every day was just a treat.  Breakfast, served by the smiling Magdalena every morning was delicious, and every day was something different.  The room was delightful.  We didn't need air-conditioning as every evening there was a lovely breeze and we had a blanket on every night. Adelina is a wonderful hostess and landlady.  She appears everyday to check in with the guests and to help plan their days and nights. Very helpful in every way.  We highly recommend this hotel for its location and for its ambiance.  Lovely!"
50,"A HOME at paradise. A Great family - Adelina & Lois - welcomes you and make your holiday unic. Best location, Home made breakfast, Clean room and lots of activities near around. Me and my wife spend 7 nights at the best place of Mexico Oaxaca. Puerto Escondido by the pacific ocean. DON'T forget to try ""BIERCITO"" Cerveza Artesanal . Thank you so much! We will return soon ..."
50,We loved staying at Quinta Lili! The staff is the sweetest! They treat you like family. The breakfast they make for you everyday is delicious. This beautiful and cozy hotel is walking distance (5 mins) from playa Carrizalillo. Staff offered great activity recommendations. My husband and I had so much fun during our visit to PE. We will definitely stay here again when we come back.
50,"Our third visit to this wonderful place. And definitely not our last.  We came this time with our 9 year old son and it was a blast.  Perfect hospitality. We’re treated like family there. Magda’s breakfasts are superb. She absolutely spoiled us.  Adelina as always knows everything about PE so there was no shortage of things to do.  Hospitality, friendship and warmth. I can’t say enough good about this place.  It’s 4 minutes away from playa Carrizalillo. Our favorite beach.  "
50,"You will have to visit yourself to understand why everyone loves it here! I had the best few nights at Quinta Lili and at the second property Villa Lili. I cannot recommend the Villas enough. Adeiva and her family were so welcoming from the second I arrived. I was travelling alone so it was lovely to feel part of the family. All the guests were so lovely too! It was the people that made my holiday!  I was very lucky as had the downstairs room which opened up to the pool, I felt like I was dreaming. Fantastic value for money, it was my little haven for a few days - the only downside is that I didn't to leave the hotel !  There are only a few rooms so you know you will be well taken care of here.  The breakfast was amazing, unfortunately I was out most mornings so only managed to"
50,"Quinta Lili is a charming 5 bedroom guesthouse just a short walk from Carazzalillo Beach. There is a lovely quiet patio with a small pool to cool off. Rooms are spotlessly cleaned by Magdalena, who also prepares a delicious breakfast every morning to enjoy poolside. She and owner Adelina are incredibly helpful- full of good ideas and will assist with bookings and taxis if needed- Adelina went so far as to drive us to the airport herself our last morning. The guesthouse is in the Rinconada- just a short walk from a bunch of delicious restaurants and away from the noisy, crowded Zicatela Beach (which is only a very short $2 taxi ride away should you wish to partake). Also only a $2.50 ride from the lovely, wide and uncrowded white sand beach  of Punta Zicatela.  I would highly"
50,"Extremely clean and cozy, super value for the money; great location, friendly staff. Unfortunately the onsite bar/restaurant is not working anymore...which adds to the relatively quiet surroundings. Ceiling fans more than sufficient for cooling. Some rooms with refrigerator!"
50,"We spend there 3 nights for new years eve, after hard searching for bookings weeks before we decided to give lptit a shot, we werent disappointed, and had a really nice stay there, good prices, great service and great spot for families."
40,"Nice hotel located downtown Puerto Escondido, close to the beach and night life places (this makes it noisy at night).  It has a small pool and no ocean view but is across the street from the beach and a 10 minute walk to Zicatla beach.  If you go here don't use a car since there are few parking places and is on a busy street so parking is not easy but getting a taxi or walking is easy and can get you almost everywhere.  You can rent rooms with or without air conditioning both are spacious enough and there is not a standard room, because of the way it was built all rooms are different so it would be advisable to take a look at the room prior to renting. Anyway all rooms are nice and well kept."
30,"Was at the Mayflower for a few days then moved to L'P'tit.  Location was excellent and the price was very good, less than I was quoted at check-in.  My room was large and very clean.  It was on the top floor and tended to be hot.  Opening the windows for a cross-draft helped as did the ceiling fan.  The pool was small but nice. Service was good.  I asked for a cab for an early morning departure but ended up with a ride on the back of the night staff's motorcycle.  Another story entirely.  I would recommend this hotel."
40,"This little hotel is truly a gem.  Its rooms are spacious, the hosts gracious, and the location excellent.  Its one fault is there is a disco across the street that blasts salsa until the wee hours of the morning Thursday-Sunday"
50,"My wife and I are very close to this place. We have been there 8 times in as many years and have always felt that it was our own. Michel and Tere have had this place built from the ground up (when they bought it it had four rooms) and it has been their lives' work. It now has 18 beautiful rooms, a pool and an excellent restaurant.The two of them are super simpatico and are comfortable in English French and Spanish. Every time we go we meet the same people who keep coming back for the same reason. The town itself is lovely and exquisite and has not changed much in 20 years. There are so many places to get to easily by local bus - Mazunte, with its spectacular beach, Zipolite for its nude beaches, Barra de Colotepec,Puerto de Angel, San Agustin. And we haven't even seen it all"
50,"This was our second stay at the P'tit Hotel.This time was around new year's eve with other friends. The place was full.  We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is very well located, clean, nicely decorated, and very friendly. Just a walking distance from everything. This time we could enjoy good the breakfast at the bistrot.The only problem is the limited parking space during the peak season. But the owner was extremely kind an managed to accommodate parking spaces for our 3 big SUV's right in front of the hotel."
50,"I was awesome ! we really love this place ! Michel is an handsome man, you feel like home... The swimming pool is cool, the rooms are perfect, you are in the great part of Puerto Escondido, when you want to party, you can go by walk to Zicatela,  when you want to feel local, you just go outside and you are in a lovely typical village.  We hardly recommand the restaurant "" Pascale"" Excellent location and great food.  Le P'tit Hotel is a rare place where you can be alone in love when you need and when you need tips,"" just ask Michel"" He's the man!  We come back there in 2 monthes !!!  Love this place and this town"
50,"i stayed here and loved it  close to adoquin without the noise. owners were great! free wi-fi too. decent pool. relaxed atmosphere. beaches right there or short walk. nice bar. right across from ""gina"" the info queen. great restaurants nearby (pascals/los crotos) fun!"
20,"I stayed at this hotel during the low season in September. Since I was sharing a double room and the discounts were in place, we had our first night in the ""two-room suite."" However, this was no suite. There was no a/c or screens on the windows, so you couldn't even open the window to let in a breeze without being bitten by many mosquitoes. Also, that night we heard these super-rats running across the roof and in the walls all damn night! They turned out to be a family of iguanas who were stealing chicken eggs from the next door neighbors. They owners even knew about the iguana problems and still let us stay there (when the hotel was only about 15% full). And yes, the neighbors have many chickens and roosters which make it their duty to wake you up bright and early every"
50,"Center,  but high enough not to hear anything. the best view. Equiped and clean rooms. The sound of the waves all night long.   The price is fair and good. Some rooms have air conditiin,  and you dont find it here in every place"
50,"We arrived at Playa Zicatela late one afternoon without any hotel reservations. After checking our guidebook we wandered the strip a bit weighing our options. We found the entryway to the Hotel Buena Vista to be clean and inviting. It appears to have been redone since some of the earlier photos on here. We decided to give it a try since it appeared that the numerous stairs would lead us to a room with a good view. We were not disappointed. We took an air conditioned room with kitchenette with a double bed. The owner offered us the room at the top of the hotel, which probably has the best views of Playa Zicatela, if not Puerto Escondido. The room itself was plain, but comfortable. The kitchenette was a separate room, and it was clean and well stocked. The owner and staff were"
40,"Hotel is clean and the people who work there are very friendly. I stayed in a basic room for 200 pesos a night which was pretty big and spacious. It had two double beds, balcony overlooking the ocean, fan, little fridge, wifi, cupboards and drawers and a private bathroom with hot water. The bathroom doesnt really have a proper door though (it's kind of a short saloon-style swing door), which was fine for me as I was staying by myself, but lacks privacy if you are sharing the room with another person.   A few nights into my stay, I discovered that it was possible to open the locked window to my room from the outside, so I was a little concerned about security. When I addressed the issue, the owner kindly arranged for me to move rooms without any issue at all and said they would"
50,Stayed here for 4 nights and the price is great for what you get. A big double ensuite room with fan and a balcony that overlooks the playa! Aide is a great hostess and will help you with any queries. Would definitely stay here again.
50,"Air con, wifi, hot water and nice views from the balcony over the pacific, all for less than 30 bucks a night? You cant really go wrong can you? We stayed for a few days, initially in a different hotel which i forget the name of and thought we would check this place out because its name seemed to claim it had a nice view. It did and it was cheaper than our other hotel and came with AC too! Really good option for people who travel on a budget but still demand comfort."
50,"I loved this place!  I was planning to stay in Zicatela for 8 nights, so I took a cheap room in a hostel for my first night, and spent some time walking down the Zicatela strip, looking at rooms in quite a few places and comparing value-for-money.  Buena Vista seemed like a nice place and the best value, so I took it for a week.  I was certainly not disappointed, and everything was great. ---> Simple no-uneccesary-frills room with a great location and views! And that flight of steps is really not as bad as it sounds :-)  Additionally, I can't understand that a previous reviewer* can state that the woman who runs the hotel is rude. The rules are clear (and in English) about (left-)luggage. And I can't imagine she would've been strict about the rules, if things were not done"
40,"I've stayed here several times and have mastered the 73-step stairway leading from Zicatela Beach to this simple, clean and affordable hotel's mid-level rooms. Hot showers, mini fridge, wide patios, and cold Pacificos at Merlin's right next door. Sometimes my room costs $35, other times it's  $55. What matters most are the Buena Vista's cool vibe, fantastic location and super-fast ceiling fans."
10,"I have never met a women so rude as the lady who runs this hotel. She was extremely unfriendly when we arrived, basically throwing our keys at us and pointing us in the direction of our rooms.  After spending three relative quiet nights at the hotel, we needed to leave our bags there until 7pm so we could go on a trip before getting the bus. The lady who runs the place refused to let us leave our bags any later than 5pm. A bit unreasonable I thought but not a problem as I had a friend staying in a different room who was stay an extra night. We could just leave our bags in the friend’s room for a couple of hours til we got back. Well it turns out you can not even leave one bag in a friends room for 2 hours. Said friend got thrown out of the hotel too. The owner went completely"
50,"This place is awesome - super cheap and absolutely no frills but great location and views!  This would definitely be the best budget place on Zicatela.  Just a flight of steps away from a shop for groceries, plenty of restaurants (Los Tios is the best!), bars and taxis come by all the time to take you to other areas of the town.  Definitely get a room with air conditioning - while loud, it's so hot there that you'd struggle to sleep without it + it's so nice after hiking up those stairs.  We almost didn't stay here because we couldn't book online and we don't speak Spanish but after some searching I found a website for them and they got back to me really quickly.  http://www.hotel-buenavista.com.mx"
40,"Good rooms opposite the Zicatela beach. The rooms were very clean and well equipped with a basic kithenette, and the hot water showers in the en suite bathrooms had good water pressure.  All the rooms are facing the beach and have balconies with outside seating which was nice. There was free wifi but only available closer to the main office- not in the rooms.   Overall, good value and a great budget place to stay and chill out."
50,"Stayed in October 2014.  Excellent spot, Clive and his team could not have done more to make our stay easy even went out of his way to drive us a couple of hours to the crocodile park when the surf was small. Deck upstairs looking over the ocean is amazing!  Good food and good times would highly recommend ^^"
50,"Spotlessly clean rooms, epic roof terrace with ocean views, perfect location just minutes from the beach, pool, hammocks, pool table, excellent value food, laundry service, the list goes on... Clive and his staff will bend over backwards to make sure you have a good time here, literally everything is taken care of!"
50,"I came here alone after leaving a group of mates in Mexico City with a primary goal of surfing and chilling. This place was by far the best place to stay in all of Puerto! The vibe from the moment you walked in was second to none, the staff and more importantly the guests were all great people! We would chill by the pool/bar/pool table during the day and then have a few brews in the evening. The food at the restaurant is freshly prepared and absolutely stunning, the fish and breakfast burritos are a must with a side of a fresh cold coconut. Will recommend this to anyone and everyone. And will definitely stay here again. Cheers Clive! "
50,"The best place we stayed at in our 3 month trip. Amazing chefs, the owner is a legend, great swimming pool, pool table, walking distance to shops and surf. Rooftop spa with epic view. Best fish tacos in the world. Wish we stayed longer. We will be back one day. Definitely recommended."
50,"Great place to stay, clean affordable rooms. Lovely pool area, great cheap food and drinks! Hotel staff and the owners are very helpful and welcoming. Friendly vibe, the best hotel we stayed at on our trip around Mexico! Highly recommend Aqua Luna!"
50,"We had an amazing stay at Aqua Luna we had 13 nights we stayed in the spacious & clean air conditioned room that included a bar fridge and kitchen with microwave - not that we cooked as the food downstairs was delicious especially the egg and bacon roll & fish tacos.  Pool was always clean as was the rest of the hotel. Rooftop has a stunning view   Staff are so friendly and accommodating  The beach is so close, as is a stretch of bars and restaurants & Great yoga studio down the street also   We are coming back for sure!! "
30,We had 2 nights. They have a nice pool area with bar and pool table. A roof top spa with a nice view. The room was clean and spacious with a kitchen and small fridge. We were the oldies in a youngies hotel. Mostly surfers as is my husband. It a decent walk to the beach about 1km and its uphill on the way back. Plenty of restaurants within a few hundred metres. It is modern and well maintained.
50,"My boyfriend & I had stayed 5 days previously at one of the other hotels in Puerto, but wishing we stayed at Aqua Luna. We checked in to Aqua Luna for a week and was so sad to leave. I now have such high expectations of every other hostel we've stayed in since because of how amazing it was, beautiful decor, super clean, the rooftop has the most amazing views and a jacuzzi! Rooms are cleaned everyday, pool area is incredible, the food from the bar is AWESOME always so fresh. The 2 ladies who work in the laundry, kitchen & bar are so lovely and so helpful. Food is super cheap along with the drinks, definitely try the chicken tacos, nachos and if your feeling a little hungover the cheese and tomato toast sandwich hits the spot. Clive the owner is awesome, makes you feel like you"
50,"By far best hotel in puerto, we tried 3 other places before we found aqua luna, booked 3 nights and ended up staying 3 weeks! Great location in Zicatela area, 2 minute walk down to the beach and good restaurants. The owners and staff are extremely friendly, helpful and professional (including the resident dog Bali!). Rooms are modern, large, cleaned every day and overall very very good value for money. The restaurant is amazing too, menu has a great range, all fresh and super cheap, we barely ate anywhere else. The pool is large and modern, always spotlessly clean with perfect sun beds to lay on. Hotel has the best rooftop for ocean views, also with lounges and spa! I could go on and on...."
50,"Where do I start with Aqua Luna!? Probably the best 2 weeks I've stayed anywhere around the world. Such good value for money, great location, awesome food, comfortable bedrooms, friendly atmosphere the list goes on... Special mentions must be made to Clive (owner) who went above and beyond for us and the other guests giving great advice on everything around Puerto and even took us to an animal sanctuary 2hrs out of Puerto, sacrificing his own time! We are so appreciative and will tell everyone about Aqua Luna. Was sad to leave Rosie's cooking too, best burgers and fish tacos in Mexico! See u next yr Cliff! Josh & Laura"
50,"We stayed at Gecko Rock in mid June for our honeymoon and were blown away by this amazing place! It was such a relaxing week. We spent a few days just enjoying the resort and nearby beach, but also went on day trips to explore local towns. Mike and Aileen were so helpful in providing advice and options to make the most of our trip. Mike is incredibly responsive to emails and so willing to help with any questions you may have while planning your trip.  The room was extremely comfortable and the bathroom had a beautiful tiled shower. Every room also has its own private rooftop with hammock overlooking the beach. It was a wonderful place to read and nap! The rest of the resort is cozy and beautifully landscaped with a ring for playing Kubb (your newest yard game addiction). The"
50,"If you come here you will never want to go to a crowded tourist trap again. Gecko Rock is secluded, beautiful, and relaxing. The food was even better than I expected after reading the other reviews, and they even cooked up some fish that we caught on a charter fishing trip. If you're into birding or wildlife viewing, Gecko Rock is excellent for that too. Overall, this is one of the best vacations I've ever been on and I didn't think this level of relaxation was possible. "
50,"Our trip here was fantastic! Some of our favorite things about our stay: Food-The food was customized to our liking and always fresh. While being fusion style, some dishes were still rooted from Mexican inspiration. We didn't have a single plate we didn't enjoy! Their daiquiris were amazing, some recipes we definitely want to try to replicate at home. Suite-Our bedroom was so luxurious and the bed was so big with very comfortable, light sheets The attached bathroom looked amazing with beautiful tiling inside. The shower was very roomy, as well. Pool-The pool was warm and large enough for several couples to be in at the same time and still have plenty of room to swim around. Bar/Palapa-the area is unique with environmental atmosphere; you'll eat here, relax here, talk here, drink"
50,"We spent six days at Gecko Rock Resort in late March,2016.  It was a wonderful experience, so relaxing after a lot of travel, with Mike and Aileen as great hosts.  The roomy bungalow had everything we needed for a really trouble-free visit.  The beach is a two-minute walk away and what a beach -- an awesome sand, rock, and ocean vista with nobody in sight, as far as you can see.  The little village of Agua Blanca is a twenty minute beach walk to the south.  Aileen prepared terrific food, every meal was a flavour experience. Mike gave us several rides to nearby towns and villages at nominal cost -- basically just the cost of fuel.  We especially enjoyed the bird watching in the Manialtepec Lagoon.  The resort has a swimming pool, a lovely sitting area, and well-tended gardens.  "
50,"My wife and I were looking for a restful place to spend our vacation and found Gecko Rock and it immediately captured our attention. The main thing that we loved was how remote it is and the food quality. Both came to fruition but the thing that I didn't realize was how awesome it was not having to think about where to eat, what to make, or what to choose. At the appropriate time, you sit at the table and food is brought to you. No choosing restaurants, no thinking about what dish to make, nothing. You sit and eat delicious food. And that is a level of relaxation that I never thought possible.   Oh, and ditto to what others have said so far. The place is awesome.  Thanks Mike and Aileen!"
50,"My wife and I found Gecko rock resort while looking for affordable, all inclusive resorts for our honeymoon. What a find!   You can certainly read all about the nearby sights and atmosphere in the other reviews, so let me stick to our experience specifically, and maybe leave a few tips on the way:  Prepare for an ""exciting"" trip out there before you arrive! The only way in is to fly into either Puerto Escondido or Huatulco, which is what we did. What a ride it was! But, after you think you can't possibly be more out in the middle of nowhere, Oaxaca, you arrive at the most serene contrast, greeted by the wonderful hosts Mike and Eileen.   Highlights:  - Eileen cooks like a 5 star chef, and every meal was utterly fantastic with incredible variety.  - Mike makes great drinks, and"
50,"I can say, conclusively, that my wife and I both had an absolutely amazing time at Gecko Rock.  After reading all the reviews here, and through our pre-trip interactions with Mike, our expectations were high, and they were easily exceeded.  Mike and Aileen have expended an extraordinary amount of effort to ensure they provide a wonderful experience for each guest.  My wife and I have different travel styles, and when planning our honeymoon, I was searching for adventure and exploration, while she was more interested in relaxation (can you tell who may have done more wedding planning?).  We were considering the typical all-inclusive resorts, but I was concerned I’d be underwhelmed by the options, and that we’d have to pay extra to actually get everything we wanted out of the"
50,"Gecko Rock's owners prepare custom menus to fit each guest's needs and preferences, so If you have dietary restrictions and like to eat, this is the place for you. I ate a wide variety of food (19 different dishes in one week by my count), as well as decadent desserts and refreshing juices. Usually, being vegan/vegetarian at a tropical resort means either surviving on salad and fruits, or being at a yoga retreat or detox program. At Gecko Rock you can eat to your heart's content.  Other than that, this is an ideal resort if you are looking to relax and do as much nothing as possible. It looks difficult to get to, but arranging a taxi from either Huatulco or Puerto Escondido through the owners is very easy and reliable. If you have any questions at all, just send them an email."
50,"Hmmm ... let's see, where to start? At Gecko Rock there are no palapas, no beach loungers, no drink service at the beach, no towel cards, no buffets, no aquafit classes, no volleyball in the pool, no nightly entertainment (well, not exactly), no blow dryers, no flat screen TVs, no a la carte reservations, no gift shop ...  IT WAS FABULOUS!!! I booked our stay at Gecko Rock in celebration of my wife's **th birthday. Right from the start, dealing (visiting) with Mike and Aileen was ""wunderbar.""  It did not take more than an email or two, to realize that these folks are good people and they would be outstanding hosts. The resort is very quiet and somewhat secluded. The beaches go on forever with beautiful rock formations every so often. You can see sea birds, local fishermen,"
50,"My husband and I spent 6 nights here in February, 2016. I was curious to see how much we would enjoy an all inclusive type accommodations, for we always stay in places where we can eat dinner at different establishments each night. I was also interested in experiencing a vacation where we stay put more than a few nights in one place. We normally run ourselves ragged trying to see and experience as much as possible. We are not sitting-by-the-pool type people. As one can see by our rating, our experiment was a success. All of the previous exultations, in other reviews, are right on. The grounds and rooms are immaculate, the food is superior and the service cannot be better. The best part of our trip though, was the turtle hatching excursion 6 of us took with Mike and guides to a"
50,"Puerto Surf is a lovely guesthouse located literally one minute away from La Punta Zicatela beach, where most of the surfing lessons for beginners are taught by the instructors of Puerto Surf. The main Zicatela beach was 15 minutes away by taxi 30-40 MXN) or 50 minutes walk along the beach. The house is clean, quiet and full of flowers, plants and hammocks. The chilled atmosphere helps you relax and forget about any worries. The rooms are simple and cosy and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. There are a few chilling areas with hammocks and a common kitchen with drinkable water, a fridge and some basic equipment/tools. We did not use the kitchen because instead we opted for the breakfast at Monchistation for 130 MXN (amazing deal!) after the surf lessons. As for"
50,"Puerto Surf is a nice, clean guesthouse located very close to the beach in the La Punta area. La Punta has a great vibe, it is a little bohemian and hippie-ish area in the Brisas de Zicatela zone. Puerto Surf offer very reasonably priced rooms in a safe place one block off the main street and a very short walk to the beach. While it is nothing fancy, the best part of Puerto Surf is the staff, the surfing instructors and the great people you meet while staying there. There is a great camaraderie amongst guests who are often surfing together and then hanging out at the house as well. Perfect for the solo traveller. I really enjoyed my stay and were happy they were able to juggle a few things to help with my last minute reservation."
50,Took 2 surfing classes with Julio and everything was great. Had a lot of experience and helped me get up quickly. Highly recommended to anyone who is in puerto and wants to learn how to surf with a good coach with a great attitude .
50,"I couldn't ask for a better place to stay. Friendly people, good location and clean facilities. Also, they have surfing equipment and classes. Totally recommended. The owners made me feel at home and the staff is very friendly"
50,"This place is so nice, the rooms and facilities are REALLY clean, the surf school is extremely well-organized, the ambiance is perfect and Davide and his family are very generous and kind. It is a very calm and chill place, it is also literally 5 steps away from the beach where you have the best beginner waves. I had a great time, improved my surfing a lot and want to return for sure! The location is great, everything is so convenient, you can buy fresh fruits, veggies, amazing food, juices and surf, get drinks, enjoy the beach all within a 200m radius, definitely recommend it to people hoping to find a calm and clean place to spend some time in!"
50,"We stayed for 3 Nights and took 10 lessons.  The Housing is Beautiful and the most Quiet Part of la Punta. In February There should be new Rooms. There was construction but only during the day when we were at the beach.  Rooms are Clean, the hosts (David and Swantje) are very helpful and the Surf lessons are good. La punta is a little Crowded but you will Catch some waves. The teaching style is a little different to europe because they push you Into the wave but it helps.  Really enjoyed the Time in la punta."
50,"We stayed at Puerto Surf for 4 nights in room 3. The grounds are well manicured and clean. The room was more than adequate and had a private bath. The room does not have AC and it was a bit warm but there was a ceiling fan that helped.   The place is a few steps from the beach and a handful of restaurants and bars. The beach is great and the point (Punta) is a popular place for surfers and for surf lessons. Based on my observations, this is perhaps the best place to stay in Punta Zicatela. There are places with more amenities in Play Zicetela, but this is a great place if you are planing to or want to stay in Punta."
50,"This is such a great place to stay and to learn surfing. During my trip in Mexico this was definitely one of the best stops!   The instructors are really cool and good trained to help you on the board and get a feeling for the ocean. They take they time, so that you definitely enjoy your lesson.   I absolutely recommend this place! Thank you for a great time David and Swantje. I would love to come back :)   Best   Sabrina "
50,"Went for a week with 3 friends. We had a great week of surfing with awesome guides who took us to quiet surf spots, gave great instruction and were very fun to hang out with. They also had a great selection of boards that we were able to switch up any given day.  The location is perfect in La Punta, meters away from the beach with a nice left point break. We stayed in room 6, which was spacious and has a great balcony on the roof where you can see the point break.   We also opted for the breakfast at their nearby restaurant which was a good add-on; healthy and hearty for a packed days full of surfing and exploring.   No complaints on the week and would recommend this relaxing house to anyone looking for a relaxing week of surfing & sun."
50,"Located at La Punta de Zicatela, apart from moving to go surf Zicatela some minutes away, you don´t need to move around with such a chill house kind of immersed in nature with lots of vegetation and the ocean right in front ... great rooms and hosts, attention is great and they will take you to surf around, surf instruction was also great, taking care of your safety and making sure you´re on the best waves! If you´re lucky you´ll also meet a bunch of other nice guests ... I hope to be back soon!"
50,"When we arrived at Hotel Tabachin, Paul Cleaver greeted us with two of his friends who were there for breakfast. Paul immediately struck me as a Hemingway-figure, especially sitting at the clothed, outdoor long-table, set with mismatched exquisite china under a thin marquee, with fans blowing and mosquito-repellent swirls burning. Paul was an impeccable host, full of stories, eager for yours and always keen for debates and conversation. If you are conservative and private by nature, I suggest announcing that immediately. Pauls' tales, intense curiosity, knowledge, and book-loans are part of the character of the place.  My other-half and I arrived during the off-season. Tabachin is behind the Hotel Santa Fe, but the taxi driver knew exactly where to go, and access to the beach"
50,"Vacations means Peace of Mind, and we found that here. Me and my fiance love to travel (I also love to surf). Paul (the owner) set us up with one of his beautifully decorated studio apartments. ""Bargain"" is an understatement, we were very fortunate to find this place while searching the web. Breakfast comes with your room, so it is so nice to share breakfast with the good company of other travelers that want to enjoy not only the waves, but the rich history of Oaxaca. Paul is an incredible host that has decades of knowledge of Mexico.    You can spot the big sign from the 200, and the balcony that gives you a view of the entire beach. Perfectly located behind Hotel Santa Fe, the Tabachin keeps it's cozy, low profile, tranquil vibe without all the ""surfer dude"" traffic you find"
50,"What a pleasure to stay at Tabachin and have such a knowledgeable and gracious host as  Paul Cleaver. I arrived early, was  shown  warm, generous hospitality and then to my spacious room on the third floor.  What a view! Endless ocean,  the sound of surf and a kitchenette. I could have stayed there forever.  As it was I extended my five day stay by another five days.  Great breakfast and because of the connection with the Hotel Santa Fe, we could use the pool.  Paul, the owner,  a native English speaker knows the area well, is more than accommodating and shares his books!  Sigh....can't wait to go back."
50,"We just spent a fabulous week at this charming and most comfortable B&B. Must say our stay was greatly enhanced by having our gracious owner/host Paul Clever there every morning at breakfast time to stimulate the conversation and give friendly advice to one and all. The other guests were equally nice and friendly which was another added advantage.We had the top floor unit with a large balcony over looking the bay and along a most beautiful beach - this too added to our stay. There was always a nice breeze which meant we did not have to use the airconditioning - ceiling fans were more than sufficient. Now the breakfasts - unlike any you will find almost anywhere. A wide variety of chioces - fresh fruit and juices, omelets and eggs any style, etc.etc.. The locals come here to"
50,"Great, quiet location just behind the Hotel Santa Fe, approximately 1 block from the beach.  The tile work in the courtyard and rooms, done by local artisans is gorgeous.  We love the large studio on the 3rd floor.  It has a small kitchen, wrap around balcony, great view, and a fantastic breeze all day. We never had to use the air conditioner.  The Hotel Santa Fe has a pool that is available to guests of the Tabachin and they have a wonderful restaurant for lunch or dinner.  Paul, the owner and host is this great guy!  Sweet, funny, witty and knowledgeable with lots of great stories and recommendations.    Amazing breakfasts are included and Paul keeps you company at breakfast at the communal table.  The food is incredibly good.  Paul has an organic farm, in another location"
50,Fantastic accommodation! the setting could not have been any better a minutes walk to beaches and bars.  Paul was an exceptional host and very knowledgable and hospitable.  All of the staff working for Paul were extremely friendly and I could not have been made to feel more welcome.  100/100!
20,"Before arrival, we were guaranteed a spacious room in a charmy hotel with ocean view. On arrival - on the dark and quiet damaged alley, - there was construction work in progress in the neighbour building, - we were met by a women, who didn't know about our arrival, even if we were the only ones checking-in, and - after a while, the very sleepy owner showed us the room. - It was spacious, but with worn out furnishings, - not charmy, but ... well, old ... and - the ocean view could be enjoyed from (the roof and) some few rooms, located on the highest floors in neighbour building, but by far not from all. Go rather to Bungalows Zicatela, which is a very safe choice!"
50,Tabachin Studios is the best option in Puerto Escondido. Is located on a little street that takes you to the main avenue (calle del morro) but the fact that the hotel is not located exactly in Calle del Morro makes everything more confortable because the hotel doesn't have noise. Mr Paul (the owner) is the nicest person you'll ever meet. He'll treat everybody as a king. The rooms are big and comfortable. The price is very affordable.Breakfasts are included and DELICIOUS! Pets are welcome too! =)
50,"Advertised as ""The Bed and Breakfast with the best food in town"" is quite modest.  This unique oasis at the end of a back alley just off the main street was a true find.  The real treasure is proprietor Don Pablo (Paul) who delights you from his personal welcome to the introductions to the international group of travelers forever coming by to the way he treats you as his long time friend.  Within a day you become part of his group of close friends, engaging in worldly conversations that continually fascinated all at the morning breakfast gathering.  Each day brought another surprise guest to the table, further enhancing the stay.    There were plenty of places to safely walk and enjoy to say nothing of the three close beaches that begged to have their pictures taken to be shared"
50,"If you are a tourist with an interest in stepping beyond the status quo of posh resorts and sterile hotel experiences, then plan to visit the Tabachín bed and breakfast in Puerto Escondido. If you are a wayward traveler looking for peerless accommodations, delicious organic food, convenient location, and reasonable price in a single fell swoop, then plan to visit the Tabachín. The spacious, colonial-style rooms overlook scenic vistas of the Pacific coast of southern Mexico. Famous organic food companies have emulated the breakfasts, which stand above the fare of other restaurants in the city. The hospitality includes enlightening conversation with ""Don Pablo,"" the proprietor, and his ever-growing band of engaged and intellectual international acquaintances. The coffee alone is"
50,"Just back from a reunion with my favourite hoteliers and their little paradise in Puerto Escondido. Joanne and Paul never disappoint. The hotel is a gem:  beautiful, quiet, clean, with an excellent restaurant, just steps from the beach. The staff are like family and the many guests who come back every year are now an eclectic circle of new friends. If you go to Mexico, visit Puerto. If you visit Puerto, stay at the Flor de Maria."
40,"This is the second time my sister and I have travelled to this small hotel.  It feels like home.  Joanne and Paul, expats themselves, treat you like family. You meet people there who come back year after year, some stay for the winter.  It is a place you want to come back to.  The rooms are basic but immaculately clean.  The price of the rooms is very reasonable.  The staff is wonderful.  The restaurant serves absolutely delicious cuisine with an Italian flair and is well known throughout Puerto Escondido. The restaurant is filled every night with expats.  The location of the hotel is great, about a two-minute walk down the lane to the beautiful Playa Zicatela, a popular beach area with stores and restaurants that you can stroll safely along in the evening, or you can sit on the"
50,"This is the friendliest place to stay in! Since coming home I've told friends it's the type of place you can wear your pyjamas to breakfast! It's small, intimate and attracts Canadians in particular. The clientele is very loyal and many of the people we met had been there year after year, meeting up with each other. Despite that it was very easy to join in with everyone. Sundowners on the roof at sunset, or alternately at Lisa's, next door; such an easy place to be. Everyone was welcoming.The restaurant is excellent, headed up by Joanne and managed by Pedro. Paul and Joanne, the owners are easily accessible and are a wealth of info. We hope to return!"
40,"We loved this little hotel like a home away from home. The owners, Joanne and Paul were welcoming and warm and eager to make us comfortable and look after our every need. The meals were very good and they also booked tours for us. It was handy to the beach and had a wonderful terrace and swimming pool with a view over the beach where we could relax away from the heat."
50,"Been coming to  Puerto Escondido for many years and have always thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this little gem of a hotel. The innkeepers Paul and Joanne are amazing. The food in the restaurant never disappoints. It is not a resort so if that is your thing look elsewhere. It is a clean, quiet family run hotel about 60 yards from the beach. Hammocks are always inviting you on the rooftop terrace/bar. No hesitation to recommend this hotel."
50,"Hotel Flor de Maria was highly recommended on Tripadvisor so we decide to check it out.  It is a real find!  First, for many people, it is quiet at night.  At Mexican beach resorts, the bars and discos play music at full volume till the wee hours.  Flor de Maria is on a very quiet side street.  The hotel is beautifully designed around a patio filled with plants.  The rooms are large with super overhead fans.  You'll appreciate the sink/dressing area outside the bath room with a large mirror and good lighting.  The best beach is steps away (Playa Marinero; Zicatela is also nearby but usually has red flags posted) and restaurants are a short walk away. The rooftop pool is great for cooling off when you are sunbathing but the hammocks under a thatch roof were our favorite.  We had"
50,"Perfect spot, within walking distance to pretty much anything you'd want to do in Puerto. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, with comfy beds and functional bathrooms. The rooftop has a glorious view and offer a great view to cool down with delicious margaritas, and/or refreshing dips in the pool. Paul and Joanne are kind and helpful, as are their staff. We hope to be back!"
50,"Joanne and Paul hardly need another endorsement, but here's one anyway.  A  relaxed, comfortable, friendly, well-situated,unpretentious place to stay in Puerto Escondido. Even the housekeeping staff has a good time."
40,"Really beautiful property with gorgeous decor and a great patio with a pool and bar. Location is okay, but you're a little bit stranded from the main strips (hotel is centered between Playa Principle and Zicatela). Lots of amenities and would be good for rooms with 3-4+ people. Too big for solo travel. Nice staff, everything was very clean. I came in the off season so I only stayed one night as I was the ONLY guest in the entire hotel. Kinda reminiscent of The Shining! Pretty sure this place would be a lot of fun (that patio tho!) with the place full. I personally prefer a bit less, but if you're looking for a nice place to take the family this is probably a good choice.   "
50,"We traveled with another couple - this hotel was so accomodating. We rented a car, easy parking. Great restaurant everyone in town eats there too. wonderful rooftop bar, laid back living. Clean as can be - nice big rooms. I would say a great off the beaten path place. If you want a lively nighttime life - this is not it. But its so easy to hop a cab to the next street over. I wouldn't suggest nighttime walking as there is no real sidewalk along the highway to gain access to nearby streets. This hotel is far enough from the highway- you don't hear it at all."
50,"Everything was absolutely great.  Morning walks on the beach...heaven.  The pool is fantastic.  The rooms were spacious, clean and the staff was attentive and friendly.  It was so great having access to a car and so many ammenities at our disposal.  Thanks Randy and Cristina for a great time. We love Puerto!"
50,"This place is a winner if you want a quiet location with a view of the ocean.    We stayed at Casanuna in February and had a fantastic time.  The villa is a very large house with multiple units, all self-contained.  The units share use of the pool and the cabana area.  These common areas are very pleasant and very relaxed.  In general, the ambiance is such that you feel as if you are staying at the very large house of a friend rather than a hotel.    By far the best aspect of this ""hotel"" is the host.  Cristina is fantastic.  She is warm and friendly and will do everything she can do to help you.  At the same time she does not breathe down your neck or get into your business, she just hangs around the house with her friends and makes you feel at home.  She's very easy going and"
50,"We stayed at Casanuna at the beginning of January with about 14 friends and girlfriends. The property and owner surpassed virtually every one of our expectations. It looks fantastic on the website, and is even better than you can imagine!  Amazing pool and outdoor lounge/BBQ/Bar area, well kept modern apartments and great location near the surf at La Punta. We also hired Cristina's private cook, who made better meals than we get at most high end restaurants in Montreal!  The place is well suited for either a large group or a quiet couples getaway. If the owner wasn't so kind to us I would've kept the secret to ourselves as opposed to promoting it on TripAdvisor :)   Thanks Cristina!"
50,Casanuna is the perfect spot for a group of friends (about 15) to have a great time! Less than 10 minutes walk from the beach and a wicked view of the city! The house is beautiful and very luxurious! Staff is great and the owner is always there to help! Perfect place!
50,"Casanuna is simply an outstanding place in Peurto Escondido - Zicatella Beach. It is not a hotel, not a B&B, not a resort. But it has the best of all of these built into this amazing property. If you want to a peaceful place to enjoy a great vacation - this is it.   A short / cheap cap ride to the local bars and restaurant that are full of wonderful latinos from all over mexico having a wonderful time. Mixed in with a lot of Europeans and American's - visiting for amazing surf or just beautiful beaches. This region of Mexico if progressive, safe and just happy / friendly.   Casanuna has this amazing outside BBQ/outside bar area - you will be writing down the specs for your own home - you will want to take it home with you. So wether you want peace - or you want to bring back a"
50,"We loved the 10 days we spent in Casa Nuna!  The appartment we stayed in (the biggest one) was unbelievable; very well decorated, comfortable bed, ample walk-in closet, great shower, nice view from the terrace... The downstairts with the kitchen and dinning-living room was very big and bright.  Cristina and Randy were more than great hosts. They prepare us coffee in the mornings, that we enjoyed under the Palapa, the best spot in the whole house. The fresh orange and carrot juices we had there in the mornings were as tasty and refreshing as the Margaritas we had in the evenings.... We would definetly return to this ideal hideaway in Mexico.  Thank you Cristina nad Randy for your hospitality!!  Victoria & Jason"
50,"Janet and I have travelled extensively throughout Mexico for many years and our 2 week stay at Casanuna Puerto Escondido was so for our finest accommodations.  We stayed on the 3rd floor penthouse, fully contained and a view of the pacific ocean, the surf and the sunset this is on of the most breathtaking you will ever find on that side of Mexico. Our suite had everthing to offer including effecient maid service and great outdoor kitchen.  You have the option of totaly privacy or a beautiful common area on the ground floor under the palapa just behind the georgous pool.  A wonderful social setting, but really, the best of our experience were the hosts, Christa and Randy. If you want to be well taken care of and a reasonable price this is the place in Puerto.  Their hospitality,"
50,"I have traveled to a lot of places in Mexico, and rarely do I get to see all the genuine folklore intertwined with interesting foreigners. Every person I spoke to in this place has a great, laid back attitude. The owners know the town very well, and their efforts to make my experience a pleasant one made the stunning house even more beautiful. The walk to the beach is very short and once there, you can go through a cave that leads to 10 miles of open, clean sand with no one but you and a few other wonderers. I highly recommend  casa nuna."
50,"The minute I got out of the plane, I was amazed at the place I was at. Puerto Escondido is such an amazing and beautiful place. It brings peace and happiness. My stay at casanuna was more than what I could've asked for. The house is beautiful, I loved the palapa/ bar area and the pool. So many beautiful sunsets and sunrises by the pool. The life there is something to experience and the view was phenomenal. Casanuna is located in the perfect spot, surrended by beautiful flowers and plants, is also great because Casanuna is located were you can see the whole coastline and the mexican pipeline. We were close to anything, the walks by the beach was amazing. I recommend everyone to go to Casanuna. The place and Cristina and Randy were amazing. They showed us all the spots to go, the"
50,"Our stay at Casanuna was the perfect combination of luxury and relaxation. The hillside location provides breathtaking views of the beach and the ocean. From our balcony we could see whales,  fishing boats and the magnificent waves, which have made Zicatela beach world famous.  Sunset watching from our private terrace was magical. The beach is only a 10 minute walk, down a colorful trail. A slightly longer trail in the opposite direction leads to the Southern shore, which is virtually undeveloped. You can walk for miles on the white sandy beach without encountering anyone else.   There were four of us in our group and we stayed for a week.  We had a beautifully furnished, spacious two-bedroom apartment, Flor de Canela.  It was a terrific value. The owners, Cristina and Randy,"
40,"This was a beautiful place to stay, very close to the beach with a great restaurant. The door to our room had about 1-1/2 inch space at the bottom so we had creatures crawling in during rainstorms. We had several huge roaches and a scorpion at 4 in the morning. However, it was a beautiful hotel and it is the jungle!! "
50,"This is one of the nicest places I have ever stayed.  The hotel is designed in such a way that the rooms are all different and have beautiful ceramic staircases leading to their doors.  Rooms are spacious, very clean, nicely decorated and equipped with excellent A/c and fans.  The walkways and pool areas are lush with tropical plants and an iguana or two!  The grounds are very clean and quiet, very restful, especialy with the sound of waves coming from across the street.  The hotel personnel are a little aloof but friendly and professional.  The food is excellent and the dining patio offers pretty views of the beach.  Lively cafes and bars are just a short walk away along Zicatela Beach. "
50,We have stayed at Hotel Ines many times over the past years. It is one of my favourites. The staff are friendly and helpful. The restaurant is excellent and the servers are awesome. The hotel is clean and tasteful. Great views and access to the Beach. Beautiful pool.
50,"Excellent organization, clean rooms and clean everywhere. The restaurant is without any doubt the best along the Zicatela stretch. The staff is warm and welcoming, the fish and seafood in the restaurant invariably fresh, and it is well worth a visit. "
50,"We loved this place so much last year that we came back again this year. Spotless, tastefully decorated, efficiently run, great views of the beach from the breezy balconies, and reasonably priced. The friendly, professional staff goes out of their way to make sure you're comfortable. What's not to love?"
40,"Stayed here with my two sisters, the staff was kind, the facilities were mostly clean ( quite a bit of poo by the pool), air conditioning and a very central location to Playa Zicatela. The vibe down here is very chill, the weather is not. It is very warm during the day, plan on being active in the morning and at night. Mid day heat for those of us that are not used to warm weather is a scorcher. Such a great atmosphere. This hotel really offers a central location to everything in this part of the down right on the beach. There are rooms that face the ocean, in my opinion, it's worth the upgrade and the trade off that the wifi doesn't work in them."
50,"Close to the beach, hot water and cool pool. Very friendly staff that will in to help anytime and with a smile. There's a nice cheap restaurant at the hotel that serves good food. Decent price for nice rooms. Would definitely come back again. "
50,"We went for a few days and stayed 18 days.  Nice clean tidy relaxing mid range hotel for this area. The hotel is not over the top but just right.  Good internet, clean spacious rooms with awesome views. Nice pool area. 30 second walk to the beach. Restaurant is great.  Best part the staff. Locals are all so nice that work there.  Will and would stay there again."
40," The service here is fantastic.   We charged everything to our room, including the best steaks of our lives.  Ordered drinks from the pool cause them sea is to rough here.  Only complaints are that the wifi didn't work well, and the shower water leaked all over the bathroom.  Wifi Signal is strong , but bandwidth made it not usable.  Shower needs ledge/lip on floor to retain runoff."
40,"Great location right across from the main beach (Zicatela). Not a beach for swimming far too rough, it is for surfing and boogie boarding.   Good service no problems we were only here one night Alot of great restaurants to choose from all within a couple of blocks"
40,"got lucky as we had no reservation, really liked this place. endless beach across the street, hotel has a good restaurant and also many nearby, enjoyed our walks on the beach and into town. great atmosphere!"
50,"I called directly to make my reservation with Miriam, and it was handled with ease.  I am pleased with the gourmet Mexican food in their beautiful restaurant, and the rooms are decorated very locally and cleaned every day.  I requested a room facing the Pacific Ocean, and it is just beautiful.  I recommend it to anyone coming to Puerto.  I have traveled all over México, visited all 31 States of the Mexican Union and DF, and I found Puerto Escondido to be one of my favorite spots.  I have experienced no violence nor derogatory behavior by anyone local here.  I will be returning to Hotel Ines again and again, it is comfortable and beautiful."
30,"The brand new Quinta Carrizalillo (not to be confused with Quinta Lili in the same area) is small with only 11 rooms, but is still one of the larger hotels in this part of Puerto Escondido.  In appearance it is generic U.S. style motel with nothing especially Mexican about it except for the sensational palapa, the thatch-covered terrace on the roof with hammocks and a great view of the Pacific.  Our room was huge by Mexican standards, ordinary decor. There is a full spacious kitchen, large bathroom and a small balcony useful for drying bathing suits.  Cable TV with 60 or so channels, a small pool mostly for kiddies, not swimmers, but in a nice shaded area with lounging chairs.  No restaurant but there are several just across the street, along with internet services, surf shop,"
50,"My husband and I stayed here two weeks. Adelina made sure It was perfect. The room was spacious. The courtyard was like an oasis with the pool and sitting areas. The highlight was the authentic meals in the morning that Rosie made. Never the same meal twice and every dish was delicious , not your typical American breakfast but prefect for vacation. We only needed alight lunch like guacamole on the near by beach. The craft beer made right here was also a highlight.  The location was great, a couple of blocks from a fantastic assortment of restaurants on the Rinconada Boulevard or take an inexpensive cab to others. We could walk to at least four beaches.  Can’t recommend this place enough"
10,I made a reservation for 7 nights/8 days and paid almost $500 as a deposit. Got the flu and had to cancel the reservation 60 days before the check-in day. Their website doesn’t mention a cancellation policy so I asked for a full refund. The hotel refused and kept the money.
50,"We had a fantastic week at Villa Lili. Adelina took excellent care of us- giving us lots of advice on where to go/eat. Rosie cooked the most delicious mexican breakfasts every morning and extra pancakes for our kids. Our family room was large, with comfortable beds and the whole villa was looked after beautifully. Our kids loved swimming in the two pools and walking down to Carrizalillo beach everyday. We can't wait to return."
50,"Villa Lili is a boutique Hotel centrally located. The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms are spacious. Breakfast served every morning is excellent - wide variety; the fruit is the best! Adelina, Alex and the staff are very accommodating. Breakfast served every morning is excellent - wide variety; the fruit is the best! Adelina, Alex and the staff are very accommodating. Alex, has a small micro brewery on site that has 4 excellent craft beers. These are also sold throughout to restaurants in PE. Villa Lili is for relaxing and is excellent to be based out of. There are numerous restaurants located close by and the large market is about 20 minute walk. Fresh veggies, meat and fish daily. Beaches are close. Bonus is the kitchen is free to use as you wish. It has everything"
50,"This is the third time I have been here and it is such as beautiful place I'd rather be here than any of the best beaches in Australia (my home country). The thing that keeps me coming back is not just the peaceful, tranquil hotel but the kindness and generosity of the the people who run it. This is not a hotel, it is a home. I come here after busy years of work and I always return completely rejuvenated, both spiritually and physically. This was a fantastic ten days. Rosie cooked amazing food for us every morning, Alex and Moritz made us laugh and Francisco looked after us (as always). This time Adelina showed us the ropes of the local market so we could cook fresh fish for ourselves in the kitchen. It is always a pleasure to return to a place that feels like a home away from"
50,"This was our second visit to Villa Lili and it really felt like we were coming home. Villa Lili is a small, family-owned hotel.  Adelina, who runs the hotel, makes you feel part of the family from the moment you arrive.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The breakfasts, with their ever-changing menus, are a gastronomic delight.  The pools are refreshing and our children spent many happy hours playing there, often with children from other families.  The hotel is located beside a couple of breathtakingly beautiful beaches - Manzanillo and Carizalillo.  It is also within 5 minutes walk of a number of top quality restaurants, including Almoranduz, Cafecito and Turtle Bay.  All in all, Villa Lili is the perfect place to go to kick back, enjoy the best of Mexico and enjoy"
50,"A group of 4 of us stayed for 8 nights across the new year period and thoroughly enjoyed our stay!  In terms of the villa itself; we grew to really appreciate its location as we got to know Puerto Escondido - it’s extremely well located by most of the towns best restaurants and just a short walk to the beach.  We found the rooms to be lovely and beautifully cleaned every morning. Small touches like having beach and separate bathroom towels was appreciated.  The pools are well designed and we never faced any issues with getting sun lounges as the villa only has a few rooms that means you never feel facilities, or the service for that matter, are stretched amongst guests. The real win with the villa however is the lovely Adelina and the staff - everyone is so thorough, thoughtful"
50,"We just stayed here for six nights and already want to come back.  It is family-run with a friendly and welcoming atmosphere.  We stayed in the family suite, which is upstairs overlooking the pool and is clean and comfortable.  It has a full bathroom with an additional sink next to the mini-fridge, which comes in handy.  The patio has a lovely view and there is a nice sea breeze. The breakfast is delicious (local specialties for the grownups and pancakes or cereal for the kids, and fresh fruit). It’s an easy walk down to Benito Juarez Avenue with lots of restaurants and some shops, and a little farther to the Playa Carrizalillo, a beautiful beach for swimming.   All in all, it was the perfect home base for our winter getaway.  Highly recommend."
50,"Our trip to Puerto Escondido and Villa Lili was wonderful. Villa Lili is a small, boutique hotel, each room uniquely designed, family-owned, and with a personal touch throughout. The owners also have Quinta Lili boutique hotel, a smaller hotel very close to Villa Lili. As we were one of the few guests there (we beat the rush by arriving in early December), we were treated to exceptional service throughout our stay, although I feel confident the service would've been great even with a full house. Adelina, the owner, and her staff made us feel welcome and comfortable at every moment. Adelina made any sightseeing/attractions arrangements we needed. Her cook made us a delicious homemade breakfast each morning. Our room was outstanding- we had a bigger room upstairs with a jacuzzi,"
50,"I visited the first time in 2010 and since then I cannot count how many times I've returned! Staying at Villa Lili is a unique experience that cannot simply be explained by the spacious architecture, the great location, the cleanliness of the place or the daily changing breakfast menu that will easily beat any restaurant food. It's the atmosphere and soul of this place created by the wonderful staff that will make you feel at peace and at home from the minute you arrive. And if you haven't tried Biercito, the craft beer made at a small craft brewery located in this very same hotel, you've missed the best beer in the entire state of Oaxaca!"
40,"a nice room, spacious, well equipped , great staff, super value, perfect location. It would be 5 stars with a TV and an onsite restaurant, but a great place for food is less than 50m away. it can be noisy at night if you're a light sleeper"
20,"We took this only as a cheap stopover on our half-way to Acapulco but next time I much rather pay a little bit more for a stay in a hotel with AC, they have a fan but it's not very powerful or it's very noisy. The bathroom is very small and when you go for shower, literally everything is wet. Photos of property look way better than reality."
30,"This place is in the center of Puerto Escondido, which is not such a beautiful neighborhood but at a 10 minutes walking distance to the bus station and a walkable distance to some of the beaches.  I paid M$ 195 each night for a private room. No breakfast included. You can get one in the area for around 80 pesos (careful because lots of restaurants only open at 9 AM). There are also 2 lavanderias very close (15 pesos/kilo).  The owner of the hotel, Wilberth, is very nice.   The room is very small but OK for one person. It was hot and humid when I arrived. There was just a fan and no air conditioning. It was OK for sleeping on a November night but I would have suffered a lot in July. There is no windows in the room, beside one giving access to the hotel interior. You can get"
50,"I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel! Excellent price. Welcoming and such friendly staff, helpful with local info. Great location! I walked everywhere. You can walk to 3 different beaches. 4 minute walk to ADO/OCCO bus station. 5 minute walk to supermarket. The rooms are HUGE, very clean and comfortable. Big ceiling fan that keeps it airy and cool. TV, if you need that kind of thing. Secure and cozy. I stayed longer than I intended! Highly recommend."
50,"I got a basic room here for $164 pesos and at that price it is similar to a hostel dorm bed, but this is a real hotel room! Nice, clean, very comfortable bed, good internet, private bathroom, tv, etc... I have no complaints for the price! I wanted to stay at Hotel 55 with a nice view (and traffic noise from highway) but they were more expensive and full anyways. I would definitely come back to Arena Surf if I needed a solid room at a super budget price. P.s. the entire hotel is very clean and well kept up. The neighborhood is nothing fancy but fine - 3 blocks to the Super Che mega store."
30,"Hotel Arena Surf wouldn't have been my first choice for my two nights in Puerto Escondido, but it was Semana Santa; accommodation was scarce and everything was overpriced.  They gave me the room for 600 pesos a night, cash, which was still overpriced for what was a very basic room, but it was actually okay. No frills, and well worn, but it was just about clean enough and there was a big ceiling fan to keep you cool at night (needed). Wifi was better than expected. The TV was a 1980s portable suspended from the ceiling at a weird angle, but it worked and there were lots of channels.   The family owners were friendly and helpful when required (bag storage, taxis). It is located more in a neighbourhood than a tourist area, but it's quite central and convenient. It's uphill all the"
50,We were lucky to get rooms during the busy holiday season at this marvelous B&B. This immaculate place is located an easy walking distance from the best swimming beach in Puerto. The rooms are very comfortable and very clean.  The breakfasts are sumptuous and excellent.  The staff — Andelina and Magda — are helpful and friendly.  Book early!
50,"Our time as two old friends reconnecting sans partners/kids away from it all far exceeded our expectations! Peaceful and beautiful spot, great location, wonderful hosts and treated like Queens! We stayed in the top floor suite - AMAZING - and were so well taken care of while given our private space to relax and rejuvenate. Highly recommend. What we wished for was what we graciously received. NOTE: Credit cards not accepted - PayPal or cash only, so plan ahead."
50,"From the moment we set foot at Quinta Lili, we knew it was going to be awesome. Literally, our second honeymoon had just started! The place is beautiful, clean and the food is to die for! The staff was superb, they treated us like family and we felt right at home. Management is very knowledgeable as to what to do, bookings, etc. In the end, my wife and I did not want to leave! We will return!"
50,"it was our second stay in Quinta Lili, while I would call the first one a lucky strike (most places were fully booked at that time), for the second trip to Pto Escondido it was clear we wanted to come back and we were more than happy to hear that a room was available for us! the property is beautiful as are the nearby beaches, a taxi to the centro was no more than 30-40mxn and most things one might need are available in the neighbourhood anyways. What made our stay unique is how the owner and staff would be always available, care about the guests, making it a truly personal & friendly experience! that alone is more than enough of a reason to recommend the place to others and come back many times!  besides we got to know like minded visitors, to share our travel stories, day"
50,"I stayed for a short period, but really loved it! Quinta Lili, is a perfect place to relax. It's clean and the rooms are spacious. Wifi is good. It's a 5min walk to the beach and lots of restaurants close by. But the most important aspect is the Staff! They are so caring. Everything van be arranged! Oh, and did I already mention the breakfast? It's great! I would definitely recommend this beautiful boutique hotel!"
50,"Quinta Lili is a perfect home away from home. The rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet.  The location is ideal - a very short walk to the beach, restaurants and shops. But Magda and Adelina make this place really special. They are so warm and helpful and Magda’s breakfasts are simply amazing..."
30,"We spent 2 weeks at the Lili, a first for us in this part of Mexico.  Adele and Madgo (as in other posts) were exceptional hosts.  They couldn't do enough for you. A diverse group of guests, 3 young women travelling solo from France,Canada,,Australian, Brits U.S.  rooms were cleaned each day. Toilitries were provided, plenty of hot water and pressure. A fridge in the room,overhead fans so supprisinly didn't mind the lack of a.c., cool breezes through the window. Wi fi good. Stayed in the Sunrise room, with rounded balcony which was nice. Adele kindly brought us to the not so touristy turtle release and a bird watching adventure. On the not so positive side the pool was desparate for maintenence after 5 days into our visit, never saw any one clean or filter until the day we"
50,"This is a fantastic villa in a great location. Playa Carizalillo is about 5 min walk and Benito Juarez Blvd is a block away. The room is nicely decorated, very clean and comfortable. The shower water pressure and temperature are great. Adele and Magdalena went out of there way to make sure we had everything that we needed. I would absolutely recommend staying at Quinta Lili."
50,"My stay at Quinta Lili could not have been better. Hosts Adelina and Magda are excellent, and make you feel welcome instantly. The accommodation itself is so comfortable, clean, spacious and secure and perfect for solo or couple travellers who love a quieter beach and some delicious local-style breakfasts. Adelina also goes above and beyond to assist with requests, including last minute travel bookings and correcting my Spanish!"
50,"Beautiful place, very nice people and a great breakfast! Easy booking process and the owner helped us with the booking of Boattours, turtle release and many more. Very uncomplicated and easy ways of understanding, the owners are speaking Spanish, English and German."
10,"We stayed at the P'tit hotel for one week in July. Our experience was not good at all.   The hotel is very small, so you would expect at least the same  hospitality than in a large hotel. We found the service rather unprofessional and sloppy, though.  Upon arrival (at 4pm) our room was not ready, although we had sent our arrival time in advance. We thought this would give us some flexibility with check-out time (wrong!).  During our stay the owners through a birthday party for their daughter in the main (very small) courtyard, where most of the rooms are located. The guests were NOT notified about the noise in advance.  One evening we came home the reception was not occupied, so everyone would have been able to get access to the rooms. This concerned me in terms of security. "
50,"We stayed for 15 days.  At first we considered moving to a beachside property away from the boats (this hotel is across the street from the beach and near the boat harbour, where the smell of boat fuel is noticeable).  But the walk to Playa Marinero for sunning and swimming is just five minutes away, and the adoquin with all the restaurants and shops is just steps away.  We decided the hotel was too nice to leave. Very private - just 16 rooms. Friendly staff and guests, exceptionally clean and in excellent condition.  We had a view room overlooking the street and the water, with a cute little deck. Great breeze through the room, although sometimes noisy from the street in the evenings. Close enough to Playa Carazalillo that we often walked home from there too. (20 peso taxi ride"
50,"We stayed only 3 nights there because we couldn't stay more, but it was absolutely fantastic! Definitely the BEST place to stay in Puerto Escondido. Thank you for that, and hope to see you soon! "
50,"Loved that nice new hotel. Michel, the host, is friendly (speaks french-english-spanish). Rooms with or without air cond. "
50,"What a great little place! Friendly owner, very pleasant rooms, squeaky clean, conveniently located and the price was fair. If you like quiet, ask for a room away from the pool. We will definitely stay here again should we return to Puerto Escondido. "
50,"We were in Puerto Escondido for five days the first week of July.  We stayed our first night at Hotel Flor de Maria (which by the way was a sweet little place in it's own right--we just absolutely required air conditioning and so we moved).  Le P'tit Hotel is tucked away at the west end of the Adoquin, the central hub of the town, loaded with restaurants, bars, and vendors.  While we never asked, it appears that this hotel is in it's early stages, perhaps recently takenover by new owners.  The couple who owns the place, a French man and a Mexican woman, were very friendly and accomodating.  We were shown one of the few double occupancy rooms with A/C, very charming with walls painted yellow and red tile floors.  She then showed us a larger room, much like the first with a king"
50,a very nice 200 peso / night motel.  it was much nicer than the 770 peso / night motel I was at in mexico city.  the owners speak english very well and made my stay very comfortable.  it appears to be no more than a couple years old.  its across the street from the beach very near the tourist information booth. i loved my stay in puerto.
50,"We stayed in a private room with hot water for a week. The entire place is modern, fresh and clean! The rooftop jacuzzi overlooking the ocean is incredible! Clive (the owner)  is a really welcoming, friendly guy with lots of tips on the area. We didn't want to leave! "
50,"2014 was our second year to stay one month in this beautiful Mexican beach town. We have been going to Puerto Escondido for 15 years so you know we love it. Hotel Aqua Luna makes our holiday complete with the excellent relaxed friendly atmosphere. The price is very reasonable and we loved our bachelor-apartment.The owners and staff couldn't be more accommodating.I especially enjoy the adults only policy,not to forget the lovable resident dog who greets you like a long lost friend every time you enter the premises. Bali ( the dog takes her responsibilities quite seriously). Miss you all at ""Aqua Luna"" but will see you again next year."
50,"This was the second time we stayed here after first coming to puerto 2 years ago.  Loved every part of Aqua Luna from Burritos Rosie whips up, playing pool with fellow travellers or getting the best surf and travel tips from Clive.  Recommend it to anyone!"
40,"We haven't seen any other hotel in Puerto so can't really judge the others but Aqualuna is a pretty good option. We stayed in both cheap and expensive rooms, and would recommend to stay in the more expensive as the cheap ones above reception get unbearably hot and the fan doesn't cut it, plus there's more noise from the main road. The location is good, not too far from the main strip of Zicatela, but quiet enough at night. Surf right at Zicatela if you're good enough, or it's 5min taxi ride to Punta Zicatela. If you are a surf beginner there are some places in Zicatela that offer lessons and will take you to Carrizalillo, otherwise you can get there on your own with the colectivo for 5 pesos and then walking 10 minutes, you can rent the board there (ask for Julio). I'd say"
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Aqua Luna for a month in April/may and definitely could have stayed longer. Not a single complaint. The rooms are basic but have everything you need and are kept spotlessly clean like the rest of the hotel by the fantastic staff. The owner Clive is an absolute legend always around to give you tips and local knowledge about puerto Escondido. The pool, rooftop jacuzzi, pool table and location are all awesome and the food is delicious and cheap! Also can't forget the hotel Dalmatian, Bali - friendliest dog ever.   Can't wait to go back, Thanks Clive and Adriana!"
30,"First of let me say the owner Cliff is a really nice and easy going guy. However I have to agree with previous comments regarding trust. Don't bother with a kitchenette room as you won't use it. The checklist is a joke. I mean who would want to steal a rusty peeler, a knife that wouldn't cut butter and a chopping block smaller than a wood chip. Go for the basic room as you will save money and don't really need an air con when the afternoon breeze kicks in. Also had some toiletries thrown out, which wasn't too much bother and can happen, but then for the receptionist two minutes later claim I owed money for a tab I never had in the first place. Seriously!!! Yes it is a surfer town full of Aussies(the only nationality at Aqua Luna when I was there) and the pool and deck are nice."
50,"I spent 10 days here in may 2013 and loved every minute of it.. It's walking distance from zicatella beach and is one of the best places to actually check the surf from (upstairs from the jacuzzi deck). The owners are such a great people and are willing to drop anything to help you out with absolutely anything, which was so handy considering I'd never been to Mexico. The service is great and the food here is simple, but awesome.. The pool is great and there is always a good vibe happening around all common areas.. It's an awesome sight upsairs on the roof top deck to see the sunset over the waves...yes, puerto Escondido is a surfing town but its also  the best place to just sit back and relax in the sun"
50,There is a reason this hotel is rated highly: 1. The price is right. 2. They have a pool. 3. They serve the best fish tacos in town. 4. The owners (Clive and Adriana) are friendly and helpful. 5. You can check the surf and watch the sunset from the rooftop deck. 6.  It's a short walk from the main surf break (I liked that it was not on the main street which is a lot busier).  We are planning on heading back there in the summer for the surf season.  Some people come ever year and book a year in advance.  We stayed for a month and were lucky they had an opening. They were fully booked for a few days (even during the low season) so we took a side trip to another beach until they had another opening.
50,"My boyfriend and I spent a month here in January and could have easily spent another. Hotel grounds were immaculate best pool and roof top area, great food and clean rooms with all you need. Met so many great people including the owners whom are around all the time and more than happy to help you with anything you need. So much fun would recommend this place to everyone!"
50,"Located walking distance from surf and commerce of Zicatela. Clean rooms, great pool and hot tub on roof. Sometimes hard to get a room, book in advance."
50,"Buena Vista was a great place for me and my fiance to stay on our honeymoon (luna de Miel).  It had a beautiful view as the name suggests, and the staff and owners were very pleasant.  I loved seeing the iguana's in the trees off our deck everyday.  They were fun to watch.  We had a room that was $40/ night, with a/c and a kitchenette.  This helped us to save money and experience cooking with the local foods.  We stayed pretty close to the beach most of the time, since it was hard to want to go traveling knowing that a heavenly place was right out your door.  It wasn't a far walk to go to a great restaurant.  Every day we ate at Mango's at least once, either for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The staff was very nice and the food was always delicious and reasonably priced.  TWO 4 1"
40,Great place to stay.  Just a walk across the street to Zicatela.  Friendly staff and great view.  The only thing that sucks is walking up the stairs when you have to go to the bathroom real bad.
50,Parked my moto in the lobby. Right on the Adoquin. Close to everything. Great city view ( I’d bustling street life below ) - wonderful staff. Both ac and not ac rooms. Shout out to Brando for fixing my tv and saving my mail for me and general helpfulness
10,"Good day, I have checked into the Casa Vieja Hotel in Puerto Escondido July 4th.  Upon arrival in Puerto Escondido I was taken to the Casa Vieja Hotel where Rennie LaRana worked last year and WITH whom I made this years reservation of 5 months, in 2012 I stayed at this hotel 4 months ending September. Last summer I spent $25,000 MXN installing  Led TV 40"" DVD player, CD Player, frig, stand, rugs, vases, ornamental things, pictures, a hot plate, electric coffee maker, a tea kettle, etc. All locked away in the vanity I paid to have a lock installed $350 MXN which I have a receipt for. I arrived today all of it was gone, stolen, no one admitting to the theft. The lock was compermised. I understand this hotel changed ownership. Even the PIN Number of a debit card I have of an"
40,"We spent 4 nights here and found the staff friendly and helpful even though very little English was spoken. Rates are from $150-400 / night. A little noisy at night but since you are right in the middle of the central market area, this is to be expected."
50,"huge room, clean, David is super friendly and helpful, surf classes are great, surf instructors are really good (I have tried many different surf school around the world and I think they are one of the best). I will go back for sure!"
50,We stayed for one week at the surf house and had a fantastic time. David and Swantje are friendly hosts and the surf instructors make you feel safe and are very encouraging. Intermediate and above surfers can opt to go with a guide and David and Carlos both took my boyfriend to some awesome surf and breakfast spots while I was taking lessons. The area is so chill and there are many great places to eat nearby. We also made some good friends at the hostel from various corners of the world. Highly recommend. Come for the right reasons and you will not be disappointed.
50,Couldn't recommend this place more highly. Very friendly and accommodating owners and great surf instructors. Had never surfed before and decided to extend my stay because I had clearly found a gem of a place and the lessons were so much fun. Thanks everyone!
50,"Not a resort and not a hostel, the surf house really feels homey, yet exciting. Great to have big comfortable private rooms, but also meet lots of like-minded people. I went down on my own for a week and made some great friends, while learning to surf for the first time and go on a day surf trip with David (the owner) as well. La Punta is really a lovely little escape and close enough for a cheap cab ride to Zicatela or downtown Puerto Escondido. Hope to go back some day!"
50,"I went solo & was there to learn to surf in August 2017. I had an awesome time, couldn't speak more highly of Puerto Surf House. The surf instructors are great, really knowledgeable, practice safety & know your limits. Other surf instructors in the area just throw you on any big wave coming in, so go with the pro's!  David & Swantje are super nice & have created a fantastic atmosphere. The house is beautiful, so quiet, in a perfect spot.  If you get the chance, definitely go on the day trip with the crew to Chacahua. It was an amazing experience!  I will be back!"
50,This was not her first visit to to Puerto escondido. Puerto escondido is on the Pacific Coast and has huge waves from time to time. The beach is stunning. It is clean but it's also extremely dangerous. Be very careful The Riptide is very strong. I suggest sitting back get a beer and watch the surface do the stuff. From time to time big storms coming and the Waves Get enormous. Only the bravest and the best go surfing. Puerto escondido is one of my favourite places in the whole world. The people are fantastic and I still remember travelling here five times during the 90s. the people are fantastic and there is a great atmosphere. If you enjoy photography you will love this place morning noon and night it is a very special place. Enjoy! Be safe exclamation mark
50,"Guest House located just minutes from the beach, its quiet with good number of hammocks and shade for downtime.  Surf instructors are experienced and keep you informed of times and are flexiable with lessons if your off doing other stuff.  The house is quiet, there's cleaner and gardener generally around most days; room was cleaned every other day if you needed including new towels.  The town is small with a good number of restaurants but was really quiet whilst I visited (May 2017).  There always seemed somewhere to surf no-matter what the forecast was  although I did find the breaks somewhat busy."
50,"We had a great time in Puerto Surf House. The surf peak was just a few meters away and we could even see the peak from the balcony of our room. The instructors made sure we got a good amount of waves, which allowed us to progress fast. It was a great time and I wish I can come back one day."
10,The only good thing is that Surf teachers have a good level. However the state of the house is a rip-off. It seems that you are going to a paradise but the reality is very different. The house is sloppy and dirty. It looks like it was abandoned. Plus you can only pay in cash and the deal to customers does not convey confidence. There are better places in Puerto Escondido to spend a good vacation. Greetings.
50,David is a wonderful host that makes you feel home. We stayed for a week and had a wonderful time. The house is only 2 minutes walk away from La Punta so we were able to go surf whenever we wanted. Would definitely recommend it!
50,"Gecko Rock is now where I go in my head when I need to visit my happy place.  I can't say enough about how perfect this trip was. I've always dreamed of being able to rent out a place with friends and family where you don't have to worry about other guests and that is exactly what's possible with Gecko Rock.  7 of us filled the place and made ourselves at home in moments.  Not only are you right by the beach, but there is a pool in between all the huts, where you can enjoy all day yummy drinks or help yourself to beer in the fridge.  We played games and listened to music without the worry of bothering anyone else.  The other perk was that usually on vacation you spend a lot of time thinking about where and what you are going eat, but here they have all the meals planned out for"
50,"My wife and I stayed at Gecko Rock Resort in January 2016 for our 10th year of marriage happiness.  We couldn't have picked a better spot to stay for a week!  Disclaimer: If you're looking for a big multi-room corporate mansion of a resort where your day is scheduled down to the minute, then stop reading.  This is not that place.    Still interested?  Good... you should be!  Gecko Rock is located about 20 minutes from Puerto Escondito & about 80 minutes from Huatulco.  We flew into Huatulco and had our taxi driver (Mario) already setup and ready to go.  He's easy to find & even easier to setup.  Before arriving in Huatulco, Mike & Aileen (the owners/cooks/do everything else-ers)  emailed a questionnaire asking about food preferences, excursions we'd like to see and setting up"
50,"At Gecko Rock Resort you can arrive and make your world revolve around the roof terrace, your room, the palapa and the pool. You will probably have walked 200 steps altogether in a day if this is your choice.   But entering the beach you will find an endless stretch for walks or runs. With a very good selection of beach restaurants down to the left. Here you can watch the staff fetch nets with fresh oysters straight from the ocean. If the restaurant you chose to sit at doesn't have lobster, you can keep your seat and order those from the neighbor. Chill and uncomplicated. And very good. Speaking of good ...  All the meals at Gecko Rock Resort are wonderful! And you should consider very carefully if you really want to miss out on the house lunch - as you probably will if you go"
50,"Luckily, our vision of paradise and what Mike and Aileen have created in their boutique hotel is a perfect match. They covered every possibility: - outrageous and healthy prepared food for our personal taste and needs - unbelievable stretch of beach that you can walk forever and never see a soul - relaxation by the pool or on our own rooftop or on the beach is undisturbed - well maintained grounds - rooms with very comfortable king size beds - did I mention the food - nearby towns with activities if desired (surfing, fishing, snorkelling, etc)  Need I say more? This will quickly become the secret that everyone is talking about."
50,"Why make the extra effort to travel here? Because you will find a little piece of paradise!  If your goal is complete relaxation, with time marked only by when the next delicious, personally-catered meal will be, then Gecko Rock Resort is for you.  In between superb repasts and beach time (with nary a soul in sight), you can dip in the pool or stroll the beautifully designed gardens. Bring a book, your camera, an appetite and commitment to relax. You will not be disappointed.    Mike and Aileen are great hosts, welcoming and available at any time.  We have traveled quite a bit and Aileen's culinary skills were as good as we've had anywhere.  Plus, Team Gecko is more than willing to accommodate individual tastes and preferences. A wonderful stay for families, couples or friends! "
50,"The best way to summarize the week we spent at Gecko Rock is: extraordinary. Forget the pricey all-inclusive resorts, Gecko Rock is the only way to spend a week on a beach vacation. There is something for everyone! Whether you want to spend all your time reading in a hammock, relaxing by the pool, exploring the nearby cities, walking on the beach or going on new adventures, you will find all and more here.   My fiance and I came to Gecko Rock for our honeymoon at the beginning of October in 2015. We were a bit worried at first, going to a foreign country and not staying in a large resort, however we were instantly put at ease when we met Mike and Aileen. They gave us such a warm welcome, and the resort itself was beautiful. The first thing you notice is the pool and open air"
50,"A beautiful small resort on a remote beach on the Oaxacan coast of Mexico.  The proprietors (Mike and Aileen)  provide you with 3 delicious meals each day and also can arrange excursions in the surrounding area.  Are you a picky eater or someone with food allergies? No problem, because they tailor the meals around your wants and needs.  All you have to do is relax. The biggest decisions you face most days is whether to cool off in the ocean or the pool, and what cold beverage to drink.  The most relaxing trip you will ever take."
50,"First things first - do yourself a favour and go and stay at Gecko Rock Resort!  On a short trip to Mexico recently, I was lucky enough to stay a few nights at Gecko Rock Resort (I say lucky, as I guess January's high season and they were fully booked either side of my visit). Now, I don't usually stay at places with 'resort' in the title, marketing 'peace and quiet' or offering 'all inclusive' food options. Normally I'm backpacking around at a frantic pace, seeing and doing as much as I can along the way. However, who knew 'relaxation' could be this enjoyable!  My room was nicely appointed, and I can't begin to describe how comfortable my bed was! (best I've slept in…decades!). A few steps away from my room was the attractively designed pool - and next to the pool was the"
50,"There is nowhere else that I would have rather spent my last vacation!  My partner and I spent a blissful 6 days at Gecko Rock Resort, including 5 days as their sole guests (where else could this even happen?)  The resort is beautifully centered around a pool (with floaties!) and only a short walk to the beach where we were often the only people in sight.  It was like vacationing at the edge of civilization (but in a good, relaxing way).  Mike and Aileen have a fantastic gig going.  The food was superb and they were easily able to cater to my vegetarianism and my partner's preferences for meat.  Also their homemade juices are delectable.  (And don't forget to order desert for your stay).  Mike and Aileen were caring hosts that both catered to our needs and allowed us time to"
50,"My husband and I stayed at Gecko Rock for our honeymoon in the middle of March. The best way for me to sum up our stay is by saying that we wish we never had to leave!  Where do I begin? I guess with our favorite part. If only it were easy to figure out which part WAS our favorite: the people, or the food! The owners, Mike and Aileen, are some of the best and most interesting people we’ve ever met. They remind us a lot of ourselves, only much better traveled and much tanner! They surprised us with a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon, which we saved for our last evening and shared with them over wonderful conversation. Aileen also does the cooking, and she made some of the best food either of us has ever eaten. I’m usually not a huge fan of pork, but the chipotle pork dish"
40,"normalmente nos hopedamos en otro hotel cuando vamos a puerto escondido, sin embargo por casualidad no respetaron mi reservacion y fue suerte, por que encontramos este buen hotelito virginia, donde por solo un tercio del precio nos atendieron excelente, habitacion sencilla pero muy limpia y buen ventilador, al final con lo que me ahorre pude quedarme un par de noches mas de lo planeado, lo recomiendo ampliamente :D es mi nuevo hotel consentido."
50,"yo acabo de ir apenas en octubre de 2012 y cuando me dijeron el precio de la habitación no lo podía creer... (150 pesos la noche por dos personas) claro que también hay que decir que cuando yo fui era temporada baja, para ser un hotel tan económico no es malo, la limpieza de las habitaciones es impecable, el costo del hotel radica en que no tiene aire acondicionado, solo tiene un ventilador, pero con el ventilador es suficiente para el calor, tampoco tiene alberca, pero creo que es muy recomendable porque esta cerca de la playa, y no tiene agua caliente pero con el calor que hace te aseguro que no la necesitaras, a dos calles puedes encontrar el puerto principal. ademas el trato es muy amable, lo lo recomiendo, bueno es mejor gastar el dinero en otras cosas como la comida o las"
50,"I've seen my fair share of hotels, both in Mexico and elsewhere, and Hotel Virginia is quite possibly my favorite. My partner and I loved it so much during our trip to Puerto Escondido that we stayed here three months, and yet found it painful to leave. The Virginia is a budget hotel with heart, with great staff, unbeatable location and a fair price.  The rooms themselves are immaculately clean, spacious and comfortable. Single and double rooms are available, complete with en-suite bathroom and hot water shower (the shower is directly on the floor, no bathtub.) The rooms don't have AC, but all feature a ceiling fan. Rooms on the second floor have a shared balcony with a great view on Playa Principal/Playa Marinero, all the way to Zicatela.  There are also mattresses available on"
40,"We were told of the restaurant at Hotel Ines. Great little spot, nice ambiance and good food/service. Shared the fish platter for two which came with tortillas, rice, veggies and salad contained a whole fish, two fish fillets, and six prawns. We stuffed ourselves and had left overs. Washrooms were clean and stocked with paper and soap. If you're looking for a relaxing place for dinner, give it a try."
40,"We stayed here for four nights in February and enjoyed our stay. We had a front room with balcony overlooking the pool area---it was a great place to relax, enjoy a cocktail and enjoy the warm ocean breezes before crossing the street for sunset. Noise around the pool wasn't excessive and never went on past 11. The staff at Ines are helpful, friendly and focused on letting guests enjoy their time. The rooms are nice, not brand new but nice enough and clean."
40,"Hotel Ines is located in the centre of Zicatela like most hotels looking directly across to the beach.  Slightly better positioned than others as there is no beach bar/restaurant located in front of it.   The hotel was secure, clean and all the staff were friendly and helpful.  Our room (303) was at the front so had a large balcony overlooking the beach and very light with windows at the side.  The decor and fittings are a little tired, the aircon and fridge are noisy, but nothing that spoils your stay.  If you're looking for a relaxed and laid back stay in Puerto Escondido, with good facilities and good security this will fit the bill.  There is also a PADI dive shop on site which also gave great service."
20,The hotel is located midway along the beachfront shopping strip and is consequently convenient. It is old and tired appearing and our room is poorly appointed and maintained. The environment is noisy and sparse window coverings make sleeping difficult. The bed is better than most we have found in Mexico as is the hot water supply a nd shower fittings but they are the only positives I can find.
30,We decided to go to PE on a very short notice so Ines was the only option we found.  The room was big and looked fairly new. The king size bed was very hard and uncomfortable but the smaller bed was ok. We had a lot of ants in our room even when we were very careful not to leave any food out. Since it was too hot (obviously not the hotels fault) we had to keep all the windows open all the time so One night we received the visit of a giant cockroach and an even bigger moth. 
40,"Very convenient right in the center Zicatela beach area. The pool was great. My one complaint was that they  charged me 3% on my credit card for charging the first night when I made my reservation. Many hotels in Mexico ask for a credit card, to hold the reservation, but NEVER have I been charged a fee! "
40,"Clean rooms. Stayed in room 11, no AC, but the fan was enough ( the controller was upside down so 5 was actually 1 and we melted for two whole nights until we figured it out). The pool is clean and really really cold and offers bar service. The hotel is close to everything in zicatela. Fairly priced, friendly staff. Noisy in the AM"
50,"The pool is too close to the restaurant. It's annoying because sometimes drunk people are in the pool; getting loud at 10:30pm and the hotel kept serving them. It seamed irresponsible of the hotel towards the guests who might be sleeping.   Anyway, we had filet mignon & it was delicious....setting was nice.   But I would not want to be a guest at the hotel. Too much action around the pool when you might want quiet.   I would eat there again. Especially because they take credit cards. "
40,"Despite our stay being a mixed experience, I've gone for a four-star rating overall - based on a room within the main hotel complex of apartments and in context of other accommodation options in Puerto Escondido.    With this in mind, the hotel does the basics of hospitality very well; pleasant staff and service, nice rooms, feeling of security, reliable Wifi, good food at the cafe/restaurant, excellent location at the heart of Zicatela and opposite the beach (a playground directly in front is also a small perk for the kids).    However, we started our break at the separate Casa Diva apartment block situated atop a small hill behind the main hotel complex.  Travelling with a family (and pushchair), this was a strain to get to - especially considering the daytime temperatures in"
40,"A friend and I arrived to Hotel Ines around midnight after an absolutely insane van ride from Oaxaca City. We were greeted by Peter, the owner of the hotel, who promptly offered us two refreshing beers. We gladly accepted the beverages and began to have a very interesting conversation with Peter.   Peter is an eccentric man, and probably one of the most intriguing aspects of the whole hotel. For sure, he is the Hemingway of Mexico. Like Hemingway, he is an expat. He is originally from Germany, but has lived in Mexico for several decades. He also smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish. I think ""Dos cervezas mas"" is his favorite Mexican expression. Peter is about 70 years old, and in remarkable health given we never saw him without a cigarette in his mouth and a beer in his"
50,"Since this is the very hot, off season, I had the entire hotel to myself. Things were pretty quiet in all of Puerto Escondido. Many of the beach restaurants were closed due to the huge, once in every 10 year, wave that destroyed much of the beach front restaurant and bars.  Since I am at the end of 3.5 months of backpacking through Central America and Mexico, I am grateful for the peace and alone time.  Since Joann is away, I missed sampling her wonderful cooking, but Paul is a sweet and gracious host and all of the staff are wonderful. Thanks to Delfina for making me oatmeal every morning! And, to Paul for taking me to the airport today!!  Hotel Flor de Maria is small and well cared for; very clean, in a nice location, an easy walk to the Playa Principal and all the shops and"
40,"Super cute, modest hotel near Playa Principal with friendly staff and owners. I stayed here with my grandma and my mother in law. We loved the rooftop pool, bar, and hammocks that had a great view of the beach. We will definitely return in the near future!"
50,"I went to this hotel maybe 8-9 years ago and just returned with my partner to spend a week. We had the best time. We wanted to rest and relax and it was the perfect place for it. Joanne and Paul, the owners, could not be nicer. The rooms are very clean. The staff is also very friendly and we felt right at home. We had dinner a few times in the restaurant and it was always delicious.  The location of the hotel is perfect,  just half a block from Marinero beach where you can swim (beware of the waves which cam be pretty strong even if much less than on Zicatela  beach). The pool and hamacs on the roof deck were a real treat when it got too hot at the beach. We are hoping to go back soon!     "
40,"The only thing preventing an excellent review of this hotel is its location. Flor de Maria is a lovely small colonial style hotel, a half block off the town beach at Puerto Escondido. Unfortunately the hotel's location, and the centre of P.E. itself, has deteriorated in the years since the hotel was built.  THE GOOD: The hotel is lovely, spotless, with a center courtyard, lush plants, hand painted doors, and a great roof top deck with a bar and small dipping pool, and a great view of the ocean. Rates are reasonable. The restaurant is one of the best in P.E., under the culinary genius of chef Joanne. Joanne and her partner Paul are the best hosts, making sure their guests are happy with everything. Our good-size room on the second floor had a peek-a-boo view to the beach and a"
50,"Hotel Flor de Maria is a small two storey hacienda (internal courtyard) style hotel located 1/2 block from the beach on a small side street (no roads to cross to get to the beach).    It is a short walk along the beach to the centre of town.   Joanne and Paul and the rest of the staff are amazing.   They are friendly and helpful and quickly make you feel very welcome.    We met several people that stay there for weeks at a time.    At times it, almost seemed like the P.E. equivalent of the 'Exotic Marigold Hotel'.  There is an on-site restaurant where breakfasts and dinner are available.  The menu is varied and delicious.   Joanne and her staff are wonderful cooks, so we ate several meals there.   The beach closest to the hotel is a nice swimmers beach, the very long beach a few"
40,"My favorite thing about this hotel was the roof, where we could order a drink, watch the sunset, chill in a hammock, etc. It was breezy and has a great view of the harbor. It's centrally located so you can walk to either of the shopping/eating areas in PE, and you can easily walk to the beach. The rooms were pretty basic - don't expect luxury mattresses or fancy bathrooms - but functional. And you don't come to a beach town to sit in your room! The owners are friendly and speak several languages. They were very helpful in pointing us in the direction of good surfing, swimming, eating, etc. Wifi was good, as was breakfast!"
50,"Lovely spot! 50 yards from Playa Principal. Roof top Terraza with pool is spectacular.  Rooms are spacious and clean. Paul and Joanne are very warm and welcoming,  remembering your name. Paninis on the rooftop are delicious! "
50,"We stayed here for 8 nights in January and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Puerto Escondido. The owners are cheerful, friendly and eager to help you make the most of your stay. The hotel is centrally located near Marinero Beach - walking distance from both the Zicatela strip and Perez Gasga, but far enough from the late-night noisemakers. Rooms are large, clean and charming. The rooftop pool/bar offers a peaceful retreat from the beach to watch the sunset. Make sure to take advantage of the owners' knowledge and recommendations of local attractions, restaurants and activities."
50,"We stayed here for two nights (wish we could have stayed longer) based on the recommendation from a friend. The hotel is very close to the beach, rooms were very clean and really cute and the owners were so helpful with everything. They even let us order breakfast after the restaurant had been closed for 1/2 an hour. We will be back and plan on staying here again."
50,"Flor de Maríais a great place to stay.  The owners Joanne and Paul make you feel really welcome.  The staff is very helpful and accommodating.  It is about a block from the marinero beach, so it is handy to the bahía principal and Zicatela beach.  The rooms are large and clean.  It has a lovely roof top bar with a small swimming pool.  This is a great place to watch the sunset from."
50,"The Tabachin is a very cute Hotel with appartment rooms with kitchens. The rooms are spacious, clean and with a wonderful view on the beach. Of you want even more space than the alteady big balcony provides you can always head up to the rooftop terrace.  The breakfast that is included in the price of the room, is simply delicious and next to the 13 choices that are already on the menue the kitchen will actually make you anything you desire.  The staff is more than friendly and the animated discussions you will have with the owner and the other guest over breakfast only add to the experience. All in all the Tabachin is three tumbs up (if only I had three)!"
50,"This was our first time staying at Hotel Tabachin, although we have enjoyed several visits to this wonderful coastal town. After wandering down a dusty alley behind another hotel, you enter a beautiful tiled courtyard with wooden doorways, caste iron gateways and pastel walls In the courtyard there are two long tables where delicious breakfasts are served and comes with the reasonable room costs. The owner, Paul Nunn Cleaver, a well travelled American who settled in Puerto Escondido many years ago is a man of many interests and experiences. He sits at the head of the table engaging the guests in conversation. The staff is small, cheerful and hard working. There is a family atmosphere here. The rooms are spacious with Mexican tiles, kitchens, screaned windows, ceiling fans and"
50,"We have stayed twice now at the Tabachin run by a charming host who presides over  breakfast/lunch which stretches for three hours.  The feast is well known in Escondido and people drop in all morning.  The rooms are large and extremely comfortable, with sitting and eating areas, kitchens and bathrooms, and balconies to watch the sunset.  It is beautifully decorated with tile work and murals and each suite has a character of its own. Staff are so friendly and the premises are spotless. Book well ahead as the regulars are well ensconced."
50,"The Studios Tabachin has the reputation in ""Puerto"" as being the breakfast place.  The people here are wonderful and warm.  The staff takes huge pride in ""their ""hotel.  Over the years I have probably eaten everywhere in this unique beach town tucked way, way down the Mexican coast.  The Tabachin is at the absolute top of the pole.    Today in Mexico few hotels are built with the care of the old fashioned traditional buildings created in the last few decades.   Once these hotels are gone, you will never see their like again.  In ""Puerto"" only perhaps two of the older traditional hotels measure up to the traditional Mexican architectural vision of Paul Cleaver who built the Studios de Tabachin.  He has worked very hard for thirty years to create this unique set piece of Mexico's"
50,"i have returned to tabachin many times and thoroughly enjoy it each visit.  i especially enjoy the tile work in the entry way, the new tile floor in the patio.  the rooms are tastefully done with many amenities and works of art, antique furniture and comfortable clean beds.  it is always a pleasure to sit down with the friendly people that stay there and those that just seem to drop in for breakfast.  the waiter, felix, is always charming and courteous and offers friendly, efficient service and lets not forget the delicious selection of food offered.  last but certainly not least is paul cleaver the charming host who makes everyone feel special and welcome.  i am planning my next trip to tabachin!"
50,"We have returned to the Tabachin for many years. Our travels have revealed no other place like it. Steps from the swimming bay and the surfing beach, The food is excellent, the rooms are uniquely artistic the ocean views are breathtaking. But to us, that is not the good part. The good part is the garden of people that gather for breakfast  and conversation. But that to us is not the great part. The great part is Paul. Paul, the ubiquitous host keeps the conversations going and the information coming."
50,"I stumbled across this place whilst deseperately searching for a better hotel to stay (I had landed the day before and spent a miserable night at a dump in El Adoquin). The charismatic owner of Tabachin, Paul Cleaver, informed me his hotel was fully booked - but encouraged me to take a seat, offered me a fresh cup of coffee and then went out of his way to help me find somewhere more suitable to stay. A member of his staff made phone calls on my behalf and I ended up at the lovely Flor de Maria just around the corner. But I came back for breakfast a few days later and can highly reccommend the menu and this hotel itself - Paul gave me a glimpse of one of the rooms and it was unbelievably beautiful. Im sure anyone lucky enough to score a room here would be very happy."
50,Paul is the best host. People come from all over the world and sit down to eat breakfast together. Breakfast is unbelievable. They really and we have returned many times. Phil Rosebrook
50,"Thanks for having us to stay Paul, was really wonderful. The rooms are big clean and very comfortable with a kitchen and a terrace what more could you want. Breakfast was so much fun everyday a few new people to meet and a couple of friends from the day before. Felix was a joy and was great being able to speak in English and the staff all understood us.   Ps Beautiful tiles and don't worry about it being off the lane way it makes it so much quieter and easy to sleep in!!!"
50,"I am in the second week of a three week trip to Mexico.  The breakfast at the Hotel Tabachin was the best by far of any I have had thus far.  Perfectly prepared, excellent tangerine juice, flavorful coffee, friendly service.  Everything is home made including the bread, yogurt, even the coffee is grown on the owner's property.  Two long tables enable conversation with other guests.  Charming patio, cloth napkins, fresh flowers on the table all add to the ambiance of this wonderful restaurant. The owner is present to provide fascinating information of the surrounding area.  Lloyd B"
20,"Although our apt on the ground floor was very poor (no window screens,kitchenette badly equipped, poor lighting, bad view etc), I did see other places in the same hotel that were better.    But still, all in in all, this is a very very basic (below par) accommodation but also at  low price. Comfortable beds  and hot shower were the only positives, which for some is the only important thing. "
50,"Myself and my friend have both just returned from a 5 night stay at Hotel Ananda. The hotel is small and quiet which was perfect for us.  The people running it were extremely friendly and helpful.  The accommodation is basic, but very clean, with a cleaner coming each morning.  The location was fantastic, just a short walk from Zicatela beach and the main bars, restaurants, shops etc.  We didn't use the kitchen facilities, but they are they are available to use and very clean."
20,"I spent 5 nights in this place with my family, the qouted price was 930 pesos a night, the online reviews were very good, however it seems the owner was away and the lady in Charge Monica was kind of rude, refusing to change towels or bed sheets, claiming that the price was too low and she was doing us a favour by respecting the low fare they quoted, she also said that she was loosing loads of money because she could have booked the same room at a higher rate so I was not entitled enough to request clean sheets, but for other guests they change sheets and towels every three days. Also the cleanliness of the room is not the best the drain was blocked and the lady didn't make an effort to solve the issue, I did instead, the kitchenware was dirty so was the bathroom. Its a good"

50,"My husband and I stayed there a few days and it was perfect for us. Super simple accommodations at a great value. A shared lounging terrace with hammocks facing the ocean outside our room and a shared kitchenette with table & chairs outside our room out back. (Shared w/ one other room) Amazing view & great location.  Naleem was really sweet & helpful. She speaks a little English, which was great for us. She organized a dolphin watching boat trip for us, her & her daughter and another couple staying at the hotel. A big highlight of our trip.  Will definitely return."
50,"La coral ist eine Perle, einfache Unterkunft  aber wahnsinnig schön! Traumhafter Strand, schöne Zimmer, tolle Leitung, mit Dachterrasse, abseits vom Trubel und perfekt um die Seele baumeln zu lassen und Energie zu ranken. Ich würde jederzeit wiederkommen."
50,"This is our third time back to Villa Lili and we will keep coming! It's a great hotel, nice laid back location, very clean, wonderful home-cooked breakfasts, delicious house artisan beer and, most importantly, excellent personalised attention. Thank you Adelina for your hospitality, we are sure we will see you again soon!"
50,"I could not recommend this more highly! We had an amazing stay over the New Year period. We were invited and attend dinner party with other guests and it was one of the most memorable with great food, drinks and company. The villa was incredible and extremely clean located close to a main beach area to watch the sun set. The owners went out of their way to help us out and even when my partner was unwell took us to the hospital to help.  The breakfast was included and a traditional mexican food that was unbelievable. We will definitely be returning and staying here."
50,"Staying at Villa Lili for a yoga retreat was a wonderful experience.  Everything from the room (top master) to the staff to the food was great.  Fresh fruit and breakfast prepared every morning poolside was such a treat.  The villa is steps away from shops and restaurants, and a short walk from a glorious beach.  The staff was kind and accommodating.  I would highly recommend Villa Lili!"
50,"Let me start by saying that I only rarely do reviews.  I believe that if the sample size is small, it is very easy to have bad experiences at very nice places and great experiences at less than great places.  Having spent  11 nights and 12 days at the Villa Lili in late January, I believe that my experience there was real and not a fluke.  To me, it felt more like a B&B than a boutique hotel.  I have traveled a lot over the last thirty years, both professionally and recreationally, and cannot say that I have experienced a more enjoyable and relaxing stay than the one at the Villa Lili.  My companion and I were in the upper level suite with the palapa roof and a world class view of sunsets.  The place was spotlessly clean and neat.  We lacked for nothing.  The steps leading up to"
50,"We stayed at villa lili for three nights over new years. A lovely small hotel close to some wonderful beaches. We enjoyed our stay very much, nice rooms, cool view, awesome home-brewed beers at the small bar and lovely breakfast freshly made each morning. But the best was the exceptional hospitality of our hosts Luis and Adelina. They cooked a wonderful meal over new years where we joined them for the whole dinner, they gave great and customized tips for things to do in the surroundings and even went beyond great hospitality on how they arranged to transport our luggage to the mountains when our itinerary suddenly changed. I can't recommend Villa Lili more if you want a lovely stay in Puerto."
50,"Such a relaxed, comfortable, clean and affordable choice! Adelina and staff made us feel exceptionally special, and assisted us with everything from activity suggestions to Spanish homework help.  The hotel is well designed, with a unique pool and common area. We felt instantly safe, relaxed and calm. Come here for a different vibe; fantastic Mexican breakfasts, glorious sunsets with a glass of wine or mezcal from your room patio watching the sunset.... Ok, on a more practical note, no air conditioning, but it didn't matter even on the hottest days the ocean breeze took care of it. Comfortable bed, lots of space, great views,spotlessly clean, lovely people. Don't go here because then there will be space when we book for a month next year! Missing Villa Lili!"
50,"Villa Lili is the sister hotel to Qunita Lili.  We have stayed at both and they are both wonderful.  Villa lili is bigger with a bigger pool and different layout of rooms.  We enjoyed our stay thoroughly and the service and the breakfast is fantastic.  Adelina and Alex and their staff go out of their way to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. The proximity to the beaches is fabulous and walking distance to restaurants as well or the city centre. We will absolutely stay here again with our dear friends Adelina, Alex and sweet Moritz."
50,"This is our second trip to Puerto Escondido, staying at Villa Lilli again.  We are here for 11 nights, and it couldn't be better.  The location is absolutely perfect - a short walk to either the beach or the Riconada restaurant district, and an easy taxi ride everywhere else."
50,"Wonderful staff, food, and accommodations were very clean, comfortable and safe.  Location is central to town, food and beaches.  Can walk or 5 minute drive to all.  Ocean view is lovely.  We plan to return on our next trip!"
50,"Villa lilly is an amazing place. Well located close to two most beautiful beaches in Puerto, all in walking distance. The main surf beaches are a little further, also within walking distance (30 min) or by taxi ($2.-). The hotel is really nice, the rooms are amazing, spacious and clean. We had one with a Jacuzzi. The pool at the hotel is also excellent. Wifi works verry good all around the place. The best of the hotel though are the people, you get the best breakfast ever served by Marie, fresh fruits traditional mexican breakfast, basically anything you want. Francisco keeps up the place with an every day smile. Adelina (who owns the hotel )and her baby Mauritz are also very friendly and helpful on anything you might need. Villa lilly is a must visit place, one of the best"
50,"Me encantó el lugar, super tranquilo y cómodo.  Muy limpio, todos los días limpiaban la piscina, los espacios comunes y los cuartos. Lucio y Berenice super atentos. Mejoraría un poco los utensillos de cocina, y pondría una heladera más grande. El resto prefecto, precio accesible."
30,"The hotel itself was nice and the service was friendly. However, I wouldn't recommend the place for solo travelers as the rooms are big and there is enough space for four persons so alone you are paying a lot extra for the space you probably don't need. The room was equipped with fridge, gas stove and dishes, which is good to know in case you want to store/cook something. There is no restaurant in the building and the nearest one is at least a half kilometer away. There is a swimming pool in the garden.  The hotel is about 1 kilometer away from the beach and it takes at least 30 minutes to walk to Zicatela ""center"" (some 2 kms). However, the place is very quiet.  If you need a quiet place for a group of 3-4 and it doesn't matter that you aren't exactly by the beach, I would"
50,"Muy confortable el hotel , excelente vista a su alrededor muy tranquilo , el hotel está ubicado en una zona muy tranquila donde a sus alrededores hay muchas casas de extranjeros ,ideal para descansar amplias habitaciones y muy bonitas , se los recomiendo "
50,We can highly recommend that hotel! We spend spontaneously two nights there and had the big apartment with kitchen. The rooms but also all common areas as the pool and roof terrace were super clean and very calm.  The view from the roof terrace is super nice and the location close to the beach.  They offer to store your luggage until check-in or after check-out in a separate room which is key-locked. Even when we had problems with our next hotel reservation they stored the luggage until late in the evening until we found a new hotel and even tried to help us find a new hotel as they were fully booked themselves the next days.  The couple leading the hotel is super friendly and there all the time I case you have a problem.  I would always come back and highly recommend to
50,"Zeer comfortabel hotel. Groot en fijn bed, airco, ventilator, kluisje. Alles wat je nodig hebt voor een fijne vakantie. Niet super luxe, wel erg comfortabel, zeer schoon en vriendelijke mensen tegen een eerlijke prijs. Alles op loopafstand. Hele fijne vakantie gehad in dit hotel."
40,"es un bue hotel que se encuentra  en muy buena ubicación  a un par de cuadras de la bahía principal, me hospede en la habitcion diamante es la mas grande con balcon con vista al mar, cuenta con cafetera, tostador, hornito, servibar y utencilios de cocina, pequeña sala tv (que no cuenta con cable) solo habia canales de antena aérea, buen wifi, te dan un juego de llaves par que tu abras la puerta principal y el de tu cuarto definitivamente regresaria. ademas de que te pueden llevar al aeropuerto sin costo"
40,"Very recomendable hotel.   Zicatela is a small town, without big hotels so please dont spect to stay in a four seasons.   This one is a 3 floor hotel with moreless 20 rooms. The rooms are small but cleen, take with you your own shampoo and towel.  The pool also is small with like 1.5m depth. but enough for you and your friends. It is located at 2 mins walking from the beach and 8 mins from the principal road.   Very recomendable, just try to get an hab with AC and on the 2nd or 3rd floor. Cuz the weather you can find any insect on the first floor.    The parking spaces are on the street, it is very secure.  There is no food service on the hotel, but yoy can find neer a los of things."
40,"I booked this hotel because I saw that Cesar replies to all reviews. This turned out to be a wise decision, because he replied to me right away. He gave me a room with air conditioning; I got a quadruple room with a sea view; and he provided me with a fan, which I use to create white noise to block out other noise. He gave me everything I asked for.  The pillows should be replaced with ones more comfortable. The property has a kitchen, which would be an asset, if it was cleaned better and if better curtlery was provided. The kitchen really could be a boon to the property if it was better maintained. The other staff don't speak English, sadly, but Cesar who lives at the property, is easily reachable. The internet wasn't great, but Cesar would have fixed this for me if I had asked"
40,"We enjoyed our stay in this family-run hotel, which is located a half-block from Puerto Escondido’s “Times Square”. We stayed in an air-conditioned room with a tiny balcony on the third floor. The room offered a very nice view of Playa Principal and Zicatela. In this hotel (which features a community kitchen and refrigerator) you’ll be 30 meters from the entrance to the Chedraui (a large, well-stocked national grocery store), 30 meters from “Main Street” (Avenida Oaxaca), 20 meters from the pedestrian bridge over Carretera Nacional 200 (it connects the business/residential district from the restaurants and hotels along Playa Principal), and 75 meters from the main (ADO) bus station. This hotel is simple, safe, and clean, and the family that owns/runs the place is very friendly"
50,"I adore this place & the people in it. I arrived in late July & will stay til mid Sept. I am in bungalow #3 which is the top studio apartment which is very private & has incredible views & a private balcony. Above me is a shared terrace with the best sunset views you could ever imagine. There is a palapa up there for shade, hammocks, table, chairs, board games & another washroom. My beautifully self contained suite is perfect. A king bed with awesome, cool cotton sheets. 2 big amazing fans to keep you cool at night. A nice kitchen area with fridge and a 2 burner stovetop. Everything you need to cook & eat, a blender, juicer, coffee maker, toaster etc.  Inti & his wife are wonderful (first baby due anyday) & live in the original 3 story behind this brand new complex which I so"
50,"I actually stayed in the ground floor bungalow at Pargo's.This part of the property has a 4 floor building behind the actual hotel;in any event,on the 2nd floor there was a couple,on the 3rd a solo traveler and the top floor is a shared palapa with lovely views.That's it,4 people in the building so wonderfully calm and tranquil.There is a small pool,more than adequate directly outside of the ""suite.""The suite or bungalow is really one large room or studio to be more precise,kitchen included.Here's the other interesting thing:there is no ac so it's ceiling fan and breezes,but after some adjustment I got used to it.The place is immaculate and the location superb,value for money incredible!"
50,My boyfriend and I arranged our stay at Aqua Luna after hearing rave reviews of the place from friends at home. We couldn't have enjoyed our stay more.  There's a beautiful pool area surrounded by wooden decking and a covered chill out area which is perfect for lazing around all day. The rooftop jacuzzi area is AMAZING and we spent a few hours up there every evening watching the beautiful sunsets with everyone. Special towels are supplied for use in the jacuzzi and pool areas as well as additional towels provided within your own rooms - this was a lovely touch after travelling for months in places where often we would have to hire towels.  The place is kept spotlessly clean and it honestly felt like we had splashed out and were staying at a boutique hotel. I know the rooms
10,Really didn't enjoy my stay here. The rooms had a kind of hospital clean about them which was good but it really lacks character. The only other ppl staying there are young Aussie males who talk about surfing all day. Don't stay if u r a female unless u like getting ogled while using the pool. The location is a bit off the main drag and up a dirt road and hill so it's not good to walk home alone at night. I'm not so scared of ppl but the stray dogs are enough to make me get a taxi. Lastly but most importantly there are way too many rules at this place it feels more like a youth hostel than a hotel.
50,"I really don't think you could ask for more. This brilliant hotel has everything you need - a beautiful pool, roof-top terrace (with Jacuzzi), amazing views, cheap beer, great food, book exchange, excellent, friendly staff & owners, lovely, clean rooms (with fans and safes & with or without kitchenettes) and great location (Zicatela beach, about 10 mins drive from La Punta). We could not have stayed anywhere better in Puerto Escondido to be honest. Everyone you speak to staying here says they were meant to say 3/4 nights and they are still there 2 weeks later.   I would not hesitate to stay here again or to recommend it. Easily one of the best places we have stayed during our 8 month trip around Latin America."
50,"My girlfriend and i stayed at aqua luna for 11 nights. We were greeted by very friendly staff who were very helpful in many ways; giving us local knowledge where to eat and shop.  The rooms were simple and tidy due to the daily cleaning service provided. The cooking gear and cutlery were due for replacement and it would have been good if there was washing up liquid and sponge provided, however these are our only complaints..  The surf was always pumping from 6.30-9.30 every morning until the winds came in. after that its chilling by the pool, playing a game of pool, watching the sunset on the balcony or having a night out with all the other awesome people staying there.  Would recommend aqua luna to anyone!"
50,"I stayed at the Aqua Luna for a month in September/ October.  The Aqua Luna was perfect. Rooms are cleaned daily. The pool table, pool, rooftop Jacuzzi , and restuarant are great. The hosts/ owners are terrific. I have stayed there in the past and each time I find a nice improvement to the Hotel. Everything is very consistent and safe.   Adriana and Clive, the owners, and everyone that works there really try to make everything just right for everybody....all that at a very good room rate...I would look no further!!!  Steve,  San Diego"
50,"I traveled across the State of Oaxaca by car and we stayed at Hotel Aqua Luna for a few days. The hotel was really clean and well maintain, it has a good swimming pool, and a play room with video games, movies, music and a pool table. The staff is friendly and helpful on everything we asked them help for. I stayed on a rooms that it looks like more than a small apartment, it has a fully equip kitchen and a sofa. If I travel back to this beautiful place, I will definitely stay at this hotel. The Location of the hotel is 5 min walking from one of the most popular beaches of the city so it was great and all of the restaurants and bars. The only negative part of the trip, it was that at night, half of the city lost the electricity and we lost the fan so it was a hot night."
50,"Stylish, safe, clean and wallet-friendly. I've been staying at Aqua Luna off and on over the years and each year it gets better. I always get a room with a kitchenette and enjoy that it's an easy walk to the beach, yoga classes and restaurants. Service is consistently helpful - if you need a taxi, a jug of water, advice, just ask. This year they've redone the pool and its got new tile and is sparkling clean. I love lounging on the rooftop deck where you get a great wifi signal and a killer view of the Pacific from La Punta to the lighthouse. If there's a better deal in Puerto I can't imagine where it would be."
20,"Hotel Aqua Luna at face value looks like a winner - it's website and exterior gives it the image of a brand new hotel / hostel with a pool, jacuzzi, restaurant / bar, clean rooms with / without kitchen, a/c, private bathrooms, etc. It does have all this but it doesn't quite come together in the way one would expect.  My boyfriend and I decided to stay here for 3 nights and if we liked it we were going to extend our stay out to 3 weeks. We were very happy that we didn't pay 3 weeks up front due to our experience here.   After paying for our room, Adriana spent the next ten minutes telling us the ""rules"" of the ""hotel"", which were very patronising. Such rules included not being able to have two people use the same computer at once, and if we did we would both be charged for its"
50,"for 300 pesos a night (2 people) we had the best value out of it. Clean rooms with private bathroom. Fresh clean towels every day, they clean your room every day, super fast wi-fi. Great roof garden with Jacuzzi. Beautiful swimming pool (again, with towels). They have a cool bar with a pool table and cheap beers and a friendly dalmatian.  Personnel were friendly and helpful.  Affordable Surfboard rentals and good food."
40,"I went with my friends for a wedding. The hotel is clean, neat, kinda posh and very clean. We loved the design and facilities. The environment is really friendly and we loved the manager. We would definitely go back next time we are around Puerto Escondido. The beach is a short time walk from the hotel and besides, taxis are really cheap and u can go everywhere for a few pesos. We loved that place!"
50,I had a really wonderful time at Quinta Lili and I highly recommend it. The locatian is perfect. Good restaurants and a wonderful beach in walking distance. Adelina was always helpful with our tour operations and restaurants. Thanks to Magda for the nice breakfast every morning. I`m looking forward to come back soon.
50,We booked Quinta Lili based on trip advisors reviews. Our stay could not have been better. Adelina was extremely helpful and always around for a chat and to recommend tour operators and restaurants. I wish i had listened to her advise about going to Carrizalillo every morning before breakfast. I only did that on our last morning and it was a great way to end our stay. What I liked the most about our stay is the friendliness and warm hearts of everyone running Quinta Lili. A big thank you to Magda she is the true  star of Quinta Lili . Always with warmest smile and anricipated our every need. The location of Quinta Lili is just perfect. We were able to walk to the nicest beaches (carrizalillo and bacocho) and to the boulevard for some great restaurants all  recommended by
50,"We don't just stay at the Lili because its a nice Bed & Breakfast in a central yet secluded location. We stay here because we are treated like family.    This time we brought our infant daughter, which I thought would be stressful, but the staff gave to us so much assistance and to our baby so much love. In fact, the property manager babysat for us one evening so we could enjoy a nice dinner.  When the baby came down with a cold, the owner brought us medicine and put us in contact with a great pediatrician.   Our baby became attached to the wonderful women at the Lili, and was just as upset as us to ultimately return back home.   The Lili occupies a special place in our family's heart."
50,"I highly recommend Quinta Lili as a place to stay in Puerto Escondido. The villa is in a very quiet part of town, but still just a few minutes walk from one of the main restaurant strips. It's also very close to the best beach in town! Given its quiet location, it's the sort of place you should stay if you are really looking to relax and have some down time. A great place for couples.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the breakfasts really are exceptional. Magda, who prepares the breakfasts, is very personable and friendly. The same goes for Adelina, who dropped by every morning to check how we were enjoying ourselves.  I would also recommend the lagoon tour that Adelina arranged for us. It was a very unique experience and we saw bio-luminescent plankton and kayaked the lagoon."
50,"Perfect place! Perfect location! I am so glad we stayed here. I always use Trip Advisor when looking for places to stay and activities to do. I chose this location because it had the highest rated reviews for a boutique hotel; that is second to their other boutique hotel 😂 which was sold out. That said, I'm glad it worked out that way, because we essentially had the place to ourselves 👍🏻 Quinta Lili is so super cute, well decorated, and extremely clean. Magdalena, their chef/groundskeeper/maid/etc is THE BEST. We could not have asked for better service. Her breakfasts are amazing. I wanted to take her home with me 😂 Kidding not kidding. The location of the property is with a 5 minute walk from one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen in my life, Carrizalillo! It is"
40,"Great hotel with lovely staff. Quite out of the way but close to the nicest beach (and the only one that we found where we could safely swim). Breakfast was lovely, really nice to get to try different authentic Mexican dishes. We had a 1st floor room with a terrace over-looking the pool which was nice. Room cleaning was really un-intrusive and it was always clean and tidy. Loved trying their beer from the honor bar - especially because it was actually different and tasty! The only thing that could have been improved was the contact before arrival - we hadn't realised that we needed to be specific about the arrival time because staff are not present all the time, and equally that can feel a bit odd at times (especially when you are the only guests and it is quite remote, although"
30,"About a 15 minute Taxi ride from the main town of Puerto Escondido. We rented the top floor in Quinta Lili in October. Arrived and were warmly greeted by a couple of wonderful ladies. It was a hot day, and our room was quite warm. There is no air conditioning, although there are plenty of fans; the staff helped us set them up. It is a beautifully decorated and lovely place with colorful tile. The water pressure was fine- and it was sparkling clean: there was a nice shower and a private spa pool (that was empty- but had water avail) outside our room on the deck- we never tried to fill it up. After the staff that met us left an hour later- we were alone which was a bit weird- there were no staff or other people in the place at all. The pool was not clear- a tad murky and not"
10,"We booked a place for 3 nights and we confirmed our arrival time. When we got there no one was there! We were standing outside with our suitcases in the rain and couldn't get in.. it looked like an abandoned place. very disrespectful, don't book it."
50,"A hidden gem. Simply perfect. Close enough, but far away from the noise. Its the perfect place for a quiet retreat but feeling like home. Cant recommend it enough. It feel likes home. Service is much more than you might expect from a Bed & Breakfast!"
50,A great place where you feel confortable immediately Very friendly staff in a quite area right by the beach and at a walking distance from good  restaurants. Few rooms but all'of them are nice  The perfect place to feel at home.... while you are in vacations in sunny mexico and in lazy puerto escondido
50,"The service and atmosphere here are just unbeatable! I have to give the caveat, though, that my boyfriend and I stayed in July (COVID-19 still closing down a lot of things) and we were the only ones at the entire place. Talk about value! Although, we both agreed we would have liked it even if we weren't the only ones. Everything was kept impeccably cleaned and well maintained. Beautiful art, plants, etc. everywhere; our room even had fresh flower arrangements! We stayed in a private room with bathroom, and it was spacious, spotless, with great AC. They left thoughtful touches like little chocolates and face masks. The only thing I think we would have changed is the water pressure/shower situation--works but I think it just needs a new shower head, kinda sprays everywhere. We"
50,"El hostel esta ubicado muy cerca de las playas. El lugar es hermoso con muy bueno estilo de decoración muy original y muy tranquilo para relajarse en la alberca.  El lugar ofrece varios espacios comunes para cocinar, jugar billar, ver tv... Les recomiendo a 1000%!!"
50,"El lugar es super tranquilo, muy pintoresc, cero ruido, el diseño de todo el lugar me parecio muy original, la alberca muy agradable y el personal super amable, tiene una zona recreativa muy agradable con mesa de billar, television y con servicio de bebidas. super recomendado para tomar unas vacaciones relajantes.  El mejor lugar de Puerto Escondido para unas vacaciones y olvidarte del estress de la ciudad.  The place is very quiet. Nothing noisy something i liked it a lot. The design of the place is very original. The pool very nice and the staff very friendly. It has a very nice recreational area with a pool table with tv and drinks service. Good location too. Super recommended."
50,"Casa Conicarit tiene un concepto totalmente diferente, es un lugar hermoso y a simple vista se ve que fue diseñado con mucho amor y pensando en la comodidad de los huéspedes. Las areas comunes son increíbles, hay una cocina super equipada y abierta que te permite convivir con otros huéspedes si quisieras, un area de pintura para ponerte creativo, muchísimos libros que puedes leer y la alberca acompañada de una corona bien fría fueron el top."
50,"Fui a festejar mi cumpleaños con varios amigos y nos sorprendió lo bonito y diferente del hostal. Tuvimos agua caliente, baúl con candado para guardar nuestras pertenencias y hasta bata para cuando salieras de bañar, además de que las instalaciones comunes estaban increíbles (air hockey, cocina todo equipada, y sala de tele para ver una pelicula en esas noches que no se te antojaba salir.) Las chicas que nos atendieron fueron extra amables y nos dieron un tour más instrucciones y recomendaciones de qué podemos hacer en Puerto Escondido. Todas las mañanas nos levantabamos a poder tomar un té o café y las galletas más deliciosas (receta de la dueña). La locación del lugar es ideal pues te quedan varios lugares increibles para comer, además de Carrizalillo (playa) caminando. No"
50,Me encantó este lugar! El servicio es muy bueno y el espacio está increíble para pasarla bien con tus amigos en puerto. Lo recomiendo ampliamente. Muy original y con los amenities suficientes para pasarla bien
20,"La dirección que tiene la casa en AirBnb es errónea, entonces costó trabajo llegar; sin conocer la localidad y la ciudad. La casa de encuentra entre la calle Delfines y Tortugas y no tiene número.  Al llegar nos explicaron que los precios andaban mal y al final terminamos pagando 6 mil pesos de más! porque la señora cobra la comisión de Airbnb por fuera de la plataforma y siempre dice que es un error del sistema de la aplicación.  La casa está muy bella y diferente, hay diferentes actividades y está muy tranquila.  El trato por parte de la señora es pésimo, de igual manera hubo más casos en el que le cobró de más a los huéspedes que iban llegando diciéndoles que podrían cancelar la reservación e irse a otro lugar si no cobraban el dinero faltante."
10,"Fuimos a pasar Año Nuevo en familia (mis padres y yo con mi esposo) al llegar nos explicaron las reglas: no hay agua caliente, no están permitidas las fiestas y la comida se guarda en el la cocina que es espacio común. A pesar de lo del agua fría (por 75 Euros por noche se nos hizo un robo), para nosotros estaba bien pues veníamos a descansar y pasar una buena semana en familia. La siguiente noche empezaron las fiestas por la noche hasta las 3 de la mañana, nos tratamos de comunicar con la encargada y literal nos contestó que nos quejáramos por internet pues ella no iba a hacer nada y que nosotros debíamos ser más “tolerantes” pues cada quien festeja cómo quiere y no que si no nos parecía nos fuéramos a un centro de retiro! de las cosas robadas en los espacios comunes nos dijo"
40,"The price is perfect for backpackers ( 150MXN ish for 1 bed in a shared room).   Despite the location is not the best, as you need to walk around 3 blocks to the beach going through irregular streets with slope, shouldn't be a big deal if you are just getting there at night to sleep.   The place and the rooms are nice, it has a pool and a cool rooftop, the only thing I think it's missing, is a bar inside, you need to but your beer outside if you want some drinks."
30,"Nice hostel with a nice pool, however when we were there they had around 5/6 people living there, also in the dorms. Started smoking marihuana at 9AM and did not really connect with the people. The staff was also weird. Checked in, I asked myself if I needed to fill something in, guy was looking at me weird as if I should know where the bathroom was, check out time etc. Just said: here's your dorm, bye! Staff came in late and made many noise and light at 3AM when they got back home.  Not recommendable, although I've experienced more hostels in Escondido to be like this."
30,"I found this hostel to be OK. There were not a lot of people here, which of course could be because of low season, but still found it to be a bit boring, especially if you're traveling solo. It's close to zicatela but you have to walk a little bit and it's not that easy to find. The door to my dorm didn't lock which was frustrating. Other than that it was clean and had a nice pool. The dorms were big and spacy, and the beds were comfortable. You have to pay a little extra for air condition, which is a must when in Mexico. There is also a kitchen if you like to cook. "
50,"I have spent nearly 3 months at Casa Daikiri over three different trips to Puerto  Escondido and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else! Julio is a great host and knows where to send you in town. The dorms are some of the roomiest you will find anywhere, with high ceilings, fans and AC, and plenty of huge windows that let air and light in. You can watch the sunset from the roof or walk 2 minutes down to the beach. Restaurants, waves, bars, yoga studios are all a short walk.  There are always other international travelers here too so you can make new friends at the pool."
40,"We stayed a couple of nights in a dorm (4 person dorm).   ++ The place is great: new, really clean, with a lot of pace for your stuff and dorm with air con. The pool is well maintained as well. You have hammocks in front of the dorms. I have really nothing to complain about. Top quality for the price you are paying (150 pesos per night/7,50 euros)  - When we stayed, the hostel was almost empty so it lacked a bit of atmosphere. And in a lot of occasions, the reception was closed so it was hard to get information, to check in, to check out, etc  I guess that when the place is a bit more full, the atmosphere can be great"
50,"Me and my bf had an amazing stay at hostel Daikiri. We rented the private suite and it was absolutely incredible, prob the nicest hostel room we've stayed in. The pool was awesome to jump into and relax after a long day of surfing. Julio (not sure if he's the owner or manager) was super helpful and friendly!! Def would stay here again!! Oh and the location is perfect!! Saludos- Lauren & Javi"
50,"Actually this was the best place we stayed in during months of travelling through Mexico. The rooms are so nice decorated, the beds are really good and the rooms get cleaned every morning. The swimming pool gets cleaned as well. The staff is really nice, the wifi is good and the beach is around the corner. This place just had everything to relax."
50,"After staying at a few hostels around Puerto Escondido Hostel Daikiri felt like a home away from home. I spent close to a month here and could have easily stayed longer. The rooms are cleaned each day, they are secure and overall very comfortable. There is a pool, hammocks, beers in the fridge and within 5 minutes you can walk to the beach, bars and a number of restaurants. Every night you watch the sunset from the rooftop and each morning you can check the waves at Mex pipe. The managers are legends and very helpful. When I return this is where I am staying!"
50,"Such a great hostel experience. The hostel is so beautiful, I could live there all my life. It is new, clean, bright and shiny. The pool is drenched in sunlight during the day and the dorm was very large and spacious, with a drawer safe to keep your your valuables locked up. Sheets were clean and your bed gets made every day, which is a bit of a bonus! The manager who runs the place, Roxanna, is so lovely and accommodating and extremely easy to get along with. The hostel is located right next to a great breakfast cafe, called Dans Duluxe Cafe and only 5 minutes from the Zicatela beach front and a variety of great restaurants and shops. The hostel is very secure and full of hammocks and a great roof top that you can watch the sunset over Playa Zicatela. The shower has great"
50,"Außergewöhnliches Hotel . Virginine und Ihr ganzes Team sind familiär und hilfsbereit , aber null aufdringlich . Vom Frühstück bis zum Snack wird man hier verwöhnt . Das Hotel oder die Anlage ist bis ins kleinste Detail liebevoll und mit Einflüssen von Modern , Tradition kreiert. Vom Design für mich das schönste Hotel in Puerto Escondido"
50,Un spot diferente con una vista increíble. El restaurante delicioso! Todo está riquísimo. El staff (incluyendo a la dueña) de lo más atento y amable que nos tocó en el viaje. La alberca el mejor lugar para estar en el relax y la playa a unos metros del hotel.  Seguro regresaremos  Super recomendado!! 
50,"Uns hat dieses kleine Hotel mit Restaurant ausgesprochen gut gefallen. Das Essen ist spitze; das Zimmer sehr sauber; die Architektur ausgefallen; die Besitzer sehr freundlich (und spanisch-, französisch-, englischsprachig). Fernglas mitbringen: vom Frühstückstisch haben wir mit bloßem Auge einen Wal gesehen aber das war Glück - mit Fernglas hätte man sicher gute Chancen zumindest Delphine zu sehen. Schöne Buchten zum Surfen/Schnorcheln sind mit Taxi nicht weit - der Strand in circa 200 Meter Entfernung hat zu hohe Wellen dafür. 100% Solarstrom und sehr schickes wenngleich kleines Schwimmbad."
50,"Tout était parfait, reposant, l’hôtel est magnifique face à la mer on y mange vraiment très bien ce qui devient difficile à trouver ici les cocktails sont tellement bons les propriétaires sont juste au top un endroit qui vaut vraiment le coup je le recommande "
50,"Beautiful modern place with a sea view, good service and delicious food very different of all we can find in Puerto escondido. I ve been 10 times in Puerto Escondido and Cabane Container is a must see, eat and stay !  Thanks to the team we had a delightful time with family and friends. "
50,Amazing trip! A totally unique experience with all of our needs catered to while we enjoyed the complete beauty of the Oaxaca coast. Mike and Aileen were interesting and some of the most hospitable people we've known. All the benefits of a personal stay with the amenities of a resort. We can't wait to go back!
50,"Gecko Rock is amazing! Mike and Aileen were superb hosts, the entire resort is thoughtfully designed and incredibly relaxing. Each meal is a completely customized menu that is based on your specific preferences. The food is local, fresh and extremely tasty. Come to relax by the beach and pool, stay for the amazing food!"
50,"We saw this resort on reddit and decided to book a week. It was a great decision! Mike and Aileen are great hosts. It is truly a personalized vacation. Before we got there, we filled out a questionnaire about food preferences. And Aileen delivered! Every meal was awesome. This stay is definitely better than staying at a big chain hotel. It is nice and secluded and activities around the area are affordable. Our stay was a perfect combination of doing nothing and engaging in activities. The resort is amazing!"
50,"All to often, the room photos and facility photos tend to be more flattering than the reality, Gecko Rock is truly an exception that rule. Wow! What a great experience. Wonderful facilities, great service, terrific food, a fantastic secluded beach. One of the best experiences at a small resort that I have ever enjoyed. Beautiful rooms, large, well appointed, with great views. The staff at Gecko Rock provide outstanding service with a friendly approach. Everything about this hotel was first class.  Beautifully designed and decorated with plenty of natural foliage throughout the hotel. The pool and roof top areas were fantastic. The hotel staff couldn't have been more pleasant and attentive."
50,We went with another couple for a week to celebrate two birthdays. It was a perfect getaway. The rooms are tucked away from the beach. Close enough that you can hear waves crash all night long and enjoy the endless water from a rooftop hammock.  The meals were some of the most delicious foods I've ever eaten. The proprietors have traveled extensively. Their food is a reflection of time spent in Asia and the fresh foods sourced at local markets.  We choose a fairly active vacation and went into Puerto Escondido twice. Once to watch the Seahawks at an American bar filled with lots of people from Seattle. Another time to shop. And surf. The guys went flying on an ultralight. They fished; we had another amazing dinner that night. My only suggestion for improving the vacation:
50,"Wanted to keep it a secret….But have to share it ! It is a little gem in the middle of nowhere ! It is not a classical hotel but an in-between a hotel and a B&B on a full board basis. Your away from any kind of crowd, 40mn form Puerto Escondido, 1h from Huatulco. Don't expect any loud music, 100% of your time with activities (well you can plan them if you want), but the sound of the Pacific nearby, the quietness, the wellness, the happiness ! Sadly we were there for a time definitely too short ! But we felt so well ! We really needed this time out off the city and enjoyed it very, very much ! Mike and Eileen are wonderful hosts, Eileen is a wonderful - great cook and both are making your stay unforgettable ! The rooms are big and very comfortable, the food - as mentioned - is"
50,"Mouthwatering food Very Affordable activities and drinks Friendly, English-speaking, fun hosts RELAXING!  To reiterate all of the other reviews- this vacation was the most relaxing trip I'd ever been on. Mike and Aileen were incredible hosts and created the most delicious meals! We wrote down everything we had and are trying to recreate them because they were so. delicious.   The beach is a less than 5 minute walk to the resort and you have it all to yourself!! There will be occasional fisherman coming by and you can walk 15-30 minutes each way to restaurants and small towns.   We stayed 4 days, 3 of which were spent absolutely relaxing by the pool, walking along the beach, playing Kubb (very addicting) and drinking beer and cocktails with friends. On the last day we went into"
50,"Far off the beaten path. Great place to get away from it all, get some sun, water, and hang out. We stayed here for 4 days and had a great time. Inexpensive, great food, we'll be looking to come back again!"
50,"Having booked the trip on a whim after reading about the resort on Reddit, it was the absolute best decision. Mike, Aileen & Prime Time were perfect hosts and made our stay so very comfortable. We decided to spend our days relaxing on the beach, at the pool and reading on the roof of our cabin, but there are some great activities in the area as well. I'd recommend going power paragliding :) If you're looking for a quiet place to stay, with access to an isolated beach with THE BEST food, Gecko Rock is for you!  Thanks for the wonderful memories guys!"
40,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a laid back, eco-friendly hotel to enjoy over New Years.  We happened upon Gecko Rock and reached out to the owners who responded in lighting fast time.  They were accommodating and welcoming upon arrival.  The property is charming and intimate (only 4 rooms) and our room had everything we needed.  The beach is a short walk from the rooms & very secluded.  The meals, served by the owners as well, were tasty & healthy.  Overall a really great experience for those who enjoy a laid back environment that you'll also be sharing with other guests."
50,"We stayed in the hotel and daily went surfing with the instructors. There are other surf schools or private lessons but once David guys take care about you there isno reason to compare anymore. They are profesionals and know how to consider individual levels and measure risks.  Arround the hotel you have everything you need within walking distance and for farer (half to one day) trips David helped us organizing. Definitely will be back, see you soon!"
50,"I didn't stay at the hotel (which looked in a very good shape), but I definitely will stay there in my next visit (planned by september-october).  I looked up for the best places in Puerto Escondido to start with some surfing lessons, so I got to Puerto Escondido Surf House...  I stayed at Zicatela for 5 days ( 4 surfing lessons included ). All the classes I took were private, what I recommend the most if you want rapid progress. Now, the most important matter, THE CLASS (which I'll divide in some bullet points):  1. The approach before getting to Puerto Escondido with the personal was very easy and quick. We just share some emails and my first class was booked in a couple of hours. 2. The class was at Punta Zicatela, just 15 min away from Zicatela, but the personal was in my"
50,"We didn't stay in the hotel but selected them for the surf lessons twice in the weekend.  I was a great experience end to end, teachers are individual and stayed in the water for over two hours until we were able to surf a few waves.   They were very careful with the safety of the persons as it was a bit crowded, loooot of patience, and a lot of humor so it was great fun.  I would recommend doing a 4 days getaway with one surf lesson each day, if possible very early in the morning so less people in the sea. On the other side if you do a 3 or 4 pm lesson you'll end up with sunset on your back while surfing, simply great.  Look for ""El pulpo"" to get great pictures specially in the morning to avoid back sun light.  Thanks to David, Niser, and the whole team!"
50,"We were at the surf house at the beginning of December for one week. It was awesome! The house is really directly next to the beach, restaurants and bars are also close to the house. It takes a few minutes to drive to the city center, Taxis are always available! You can also walk along the beach to go to the city. The atmosphere in La Punta is really relaxed and calm.  We also had some surf lessons, it was also really good! They bring you to good surf spots, every instructor has one or two surf students. You get your board and all stuff you need for surfing, even UV Shirts! Nevertheless, I don't if the classes are also an option for intermediate or advanced surfer. I just saw beginner taking classes. But you can also just rent a board and have fun.   I recommend everyone to"
50,"We stayed for 5 nights and surfed every day, the room was cool, clean and spacious and the outside living areas had plenty of lush tropical gardens and hammocks to relax in.   The surf instructors were patient, skilled and I felt safe and well looked after. They made the lessons fun and I'd recommend purchasing the photo packages which are a great reminder of the experience of learning to surf at such an iconic beach and also help to show you how to improve your technique!  The team were fantastic and I would love to return one day. You won't be disappointed! :) "
50,"We visited for 5 days at the start of November.  We arrived at 8am and there was no-one there to greet us (it turns out they were all out surfing) but someone had let an instructor know as he came to meet us 10 minutes later. The rooms are not ready until 12 (our fault for arriving so early) but the property is in a great location to get food/sit on the beach while you wait.  Room 6 is beautiful with a roof terrace and lovely large floor space.  The bathroom is a bit basic but is all you need for a beach location.  I'd advise to take earplugs as the stray dogs have a dawn chorus each morning which can be hard to sleep through. Surf lessons were excellent, more than enough instructors and good equipment.   Fully recommended as it's excellent value."
50,"The place itself was spacious, social and filled with a great vibe.   The surf school is exceptional in my opinion. I've seen a lot of schools over the years (although I had never done lessons myself until now) and these guys are great at teaching at the right level depending on where you are in your surf skills. I will definitely be back one day!"
50,"I visited puerto escondido with my girlfriend and we stayed in room 6 in Puerto surf house for five days, from the beggining of our stay we felt really good with our room, the house and the staff.  My brother stayed there with some friends a year back and they had only good comments about the house. It was our first time surfing and the instructors were so friendly and patient, we thought 5 days was a short time to learn how to surf properly but we got the hang of it thanks to our awesome instructors.   We really reccomend the house if you want to learn how to surf or if you want to chill near a relaxed and quiet area of the town."
10,"Pros - The location in Punta is great, Punta is very chilled area which is why so many people have such a great time  Cons  1) No hot water, no bathroom door 2) Kitchen was dirty  3) room 4 private room (we stayed here) has mosquito nets but also has open holes in the roof, with no mosquito nets on them therefore the room has lots of mosquitos in it day and night. We were eaten alive.  4) mosquito net over bed has holes and lets mosquitos up the bottom 5) their dog barks all night and no one stops it. Don't expect to get much sleep 6) no one was there to check us in (we had to find our room ourselves) then when they did arrive, we didn't receive any information about the area, check out times, wifi password, kitchen usage... Nada! Hospitality is therefore not their strong point "
50,"This is the 2nd time I stay at Puerto Surf House and I have to say I am in love with this place 😊. The hosts are super nice people, will help you with whatever you need and make sure you are comfortable at all times. The hammocks and the garden are a great place to relax after surfing. The instructors are amazing, very patient and encouraging so you can improve and take advantage of your stay in Puerto Escondido, we also got awesome gopro sessions on the surf board and the videos and pictures came out pretty cool. The surf house is right across from the beach where you can find great waves and many restaurants and shops near by. I loved every aspect of our trip and look forward to visiting again very soon! Thank you Neiser, Julio, Coco, Oscar for the most awesome waves!! 😃"
30,"We had an unfortunate covid experience within our group. This review is simply to say that Osmany at the front desk was exceptionally patient and helpful. Thank you Osmany!  As for the resort, it was not as upscale as we are used to and we would choose a more luxurious/modern resort next time."
10,If you are looking for a relaxing place to stay this is not the spot. I feel like I am in a concrete jungle. All day long construction goes on. Whether you are relaxing the pool or trying to enjoy your sunset balcony the noise is happening. I feel sorry for the owners but as a renter I paid too. Until the condos next door are done stay away. Or hopefully they lower their rate because it’s expensive. Don’t get me wrong the suites are beautiful millionaire style. But I like to be outside 
40,"Good hotel overall. Very quiet locale. Easy access to the city. Just a few blocks from the Adoquin. Wi-Fi signal was weak, or non-existent at times. Hotel was always clean, and restaurant had good food. Front desk will call for taxis, when you leave the room, which was handy"
30,"With my gigantic room overlooking the beaches of Puerto Escondido, why is my rating not higher? It is hard to say. I walked everywhere and loved the hilltop perch and the quiet. I speak Spanish and am generally low maintenance yet it felt as though simple pleasures such as a quiet coffee in the morning were a challenge. Since I appeared each morning with the same small need, coffee, I am not sure why it always seemed as though this was a puzzling and somewhat inconvenient request. Having said that, it is a good location from which to explore all the areas as you can walk virtually everywhere.  I would not recommend the food, but there are many restaurants nearby. Definitely good value and very peaceful."
40,"The hotel is on a hill overlooking the main bay.  The view from the room was delightful, and the room itself was more than spacious.  The room was clean, and well maintained.  The hotel grounds and pool are also up to a high standard.  The staff is friendly.  The margarita at the bar was tasty, and the beer was ice-cold.  Price for the drinks was very reasonable. A five minute walk and some stairs lead to a nice bay and swimming beach.  We enjoyed our time there, and will come back. I have two suggestions for improvement.  With these, my rating could easily rise to a five. 1.  Heavier curtains (The full moon illuminated the room).  2.  A small fridge."
50,"The hotel exceeded my expectations in every way.  Excellent a/c, friendly and helpful staff in the hotel, a tasty breakfast, and a very comfortable bed, a large shower with plenty of hot water, all surrounded by nicely landscaped grounds.  Highly recommended.  Although not right on the beach, we had a view of the water from the hotel room and it is a short walk to the swimming beach, a longer walk to the surfing beach.  El hotel excedió mis esperanzas en todas maneras; el aire acondicionado funcionó perfectamente, personal del hotel muy amable; un desayuno sabroso; una cama muy cómodo; una regadera amplia con agua caliente, y un jardin hermosa. Lo recomiendo ampliamente!"
40,If you want to swim in the warm Pacific this is the place to be. Ten minute walk to Manzanillo Beach. The hotel restaurant is on a breezy second floor terrace. Food and prices are good. The pool area offers some shade in the afternoon and has an outdoor shower. Staff are helpful and friendly.
40,"as was said in other reviews, not on the beach, but maybe a 2 to . 3 minute walk. your right in a neighborhood with a school next door, bus comes right out front to take you uptown for 5 paesos. great views great pool, and the restaurant, was as good and as affordable as anyplace else in town. very friendly staff. we just loved the location, right access for everything you need to do. manzanillo beach is just a 5 min walk away"
40,This a nice hotel that is beginning to get tired. It offers great value for money but the rooms could do with a little modernisation - the shower room and toilet being a bit scruffy. The pool was virtually empty most of the time. the staff were really friendly.
50,"We ended up staying  5 days and found it to be a  welcoming sanctuary.  On our arrival in P.E. we were searching for accomodation down the strip when someone recommended it to us.  Finding it  the first time wasn't the easiest, but on arrival and checkin we were made to feel at home with friendly staff, super accomodation, great ocean view.  Staff always went the extra mile to make things just right.  The restaurant was priced very reasonably with good food. A short walk took us to church, great beaches, other restaurants and shopping.  Our room had air conditioning which we never use, a celing fan would have been great.   Can't say anything but good things and found that many of their guests were repeat lodgers, we have recommended it to our friends, ken and francine in winnipeg"
50,"My girlfriend and I spent 11 days at the Hotel Ines. We could not possibly have been more pleased with our stay. Security was never a concern, and every member of the staff was ultra attentive to us the entire stay; and we are rather high maintenance. During our time in Puerto, we checked out all the other places and options and I am quite sure Ines was the best call. It is located in the center of Zicatela and everything in the area is walking distance or a $3 cab ride away. We also quickly found that Ines consistantly has the best food in the area."
50,"In the last 5 years we stayed a number of times at hotel Ines  Puerto Escondido. I thought it's time I write a review. Walking pass the gate into hotel Ines courtyard you will see the pool surrounded by lush vegetation with colourful flowers. Most rooms are with an ocean view, spacious and super clean, the decor is in harmony with the local environment . It feels open and fresh.. The restaurant under the palapa overlooks the pool and lush blooming garden. The tables are covered with Oaxacan woven tablecloth and a small vase with fresh flowers . The amber onyx lighting at night has a warm and relaxed atmosphere . The food  is delicious and always consistent.  The service is friendly and good.  I see the same staff since we started going there 5 years ago, so I always feel"
50,Great hotel in a convenient location across the street from the beach with dozens of restaurants and shops in easy walking distance. There is also a great restaurant offering international food on premises. I would highly recommend Beach Hotel Ines if you are traveling to Puerto Escondido!
20,"We arrived tired & without a reservation. Informed the only room available would cost $1,000 Pesos with a Sea View & Air Con. Too tired to shop around we accepted. When we saw the state of the room, the poor ocean view, the broken air con (broke 3 times in 1 night & blowing hot air) we realised we had been ripped off - During low season also! Next day checked out & booked into a far better room in hotel literally next door, traditional type but was far cleaner with sea view for $450 pesos & a wonderful pool area!  Pros: Directly opposite the beach Some rooms with a Sea view but rest with limited view.  Comfortable bed Pleasant outdoor dining area with a small plunge pool.  Hot shower Breakfast OK  Cons; Noisy at night as directly opposite bars & main road.  Shared balconies with"
30,"Stayed at the Ines for 2 nights but were turned off by the owners whining, crying children around the pool area. Our room (#1) was small but clean. Shame of the noise of people talking loudly outside our room early in the morning. Good restaurant with friendly service."
40,"I spent four nights here and enjoyed my stay. The cheapest rooms are small, dark and loud but I got one of the rooms at the back and have a spacious room which was nice and quiet. Very good value for money  - I stayed during the low season but still. The fan in my room only worked when out on the maximum speed, which made it very noisy and cool at night but I was happy to have a proper fan. Great location with an amazing beach and good bars and restaurants very near by."
50,I have stayed there 3 times  Ines runs a great show . With  beach rooms staff pool and location all add up to a truly 5 star experience . Thankyou to Ines and all her staff . Its a shame others dont follow in your foot steps  Thanks john 
40,"You get a great room, good food, a nice pool, well kept grounds, a place to park your Jeep, if you happen to be overlanding as we are! Quiet at night, right on the beach and easy to walk around town... Oh, and the price is right! What more could you ask for??? Hope this review was helpful!!!"
40,"The hotel is right in front playa zicatela (very nice beach but a little bit dangerous for those who aren't surfers or experts). It is surrounded  by restaurants, small stores and surfers. The rooms are nice and clean. The pool was always crowded so we never used it.  The restaurant always smelled  delicious and it had good prices (they serve good coffee).  The only bad thing was that our bathroom had a bad smell. We had to keep the bathroom door closed at all times. We couldn't change the room because the hotel was full.  Anyways we had a good time. It is affordable, clean and nice."
50,"Hotel Ines is in the middle of life of the Zicatella beach. its near to Cafecito or Mango for delicoeus breakfast, near to shops, near to beach bars. But as in front there is only a children playground you have great views to the beach and waves where you can watch the surfers in the morning. Rooms are practical and nicely decorated and you feel the german perfection in the organization - everything clean and the room was always made when we came back from breakfast. Meals are delicous in the small restaurant and as the hotel is not that big, you quickly can get contact. The swimming pool and area is rather small and they do not have a beachclub. If you would like to have a sun roof and chairs, you pay extra on the beach. But if I would come once more to Zicatella, I surely"
50,"Super comfy and beautiful hotel. We were a party of six: four adults and two children of 5 and 3. My husband and I enjoyed our romantic, isolated room on the top floor. A DELICIOUS breakfast is offered every day, includes local food, which is always fresh and the fruit perfectly ripe. We got flawless recommendations of local attractions by Adeline, our wonderful host. She also made the necessary arrangements with the local suppliers and got us better deals. We got to do and see amazing activities with a very reasonable price. Do not miss the bioluminescence lagoon, is one of a kind. Do not recommend going there during Mexico´s holy week: the beach gets impossibly crowded."
50,"We spent at month at Villa Lili and really found it to be a second home.  The owners are lovely people who always go out of their way to ensure you have everything you need.  The staff are all friendly and lovely.  The hotel is clean and pretty too.  We have a 2 year old who could be quite a handful at times and everyone was very nice and understanding when he had some off moments.  They have a chef who makes a lovely big breakfast, mainly typical mexican, but they will make pancakes or eggs if you prefer.  They even made chocolate banana shakes for my son!  We loved the chef, Katia, and ending up making good friends with her, but sadly I think now she has returned to Mexico City to cook at her restaurant, I have no doubt her replacement will do the same fantastic job.  My only"
50,"We had an extraordinary 8 days at Villa Lili. The staff treats you like family and is in ""the know"" with all the things to enjoy and explore. The rooms are spacious and clean and offer a nice view on the upper levels. The breakfast each morning is delicious and fresh which also include fresh squeezed juice. I was able to even take a cooking class which was a lot of fun, the Shrimp Ceviche with Chia seeds is a recipe I use at home and will always remind me of Puerto. We can't wait to go back and visit our friends."
50,"This hotel is a real gem - Adelina (who runs the hotel) was wonderful and also helped to organise some amazing trips (she knows all of the local suppliers and can organise things very easily and cheaply, including a trip to the local turtle sanctuary and a fantastic dolphin and whale spotting outing).  The rooms are great and most (if not all) have terrific views of the sunset and the communal areas are incredibly relaxed and peaceful - very much a 'mi casa [es] su casa' kind of feel, which is lovely.  The staff are all very friendly too and Spanish is encouraged (though absolutely not necessary!).  All of the beaches are within walking distance and town is 5 minutes away.  Puerto Escondido is a great beach (and surf) town and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay -"
50,"I have just completed a stay of 2.5 months at Villa Lili.  It is a top-quality boutique hotel, richly deserving of its high ranking on Trip Advisor.  Highlights of the hotel include impeccable cleanliness, outstanding service, comfort and security, delicious breakfasts, and a great location to enjoy the laid-back lifestyle of Puerto Escondido.  The cleaning staff of the hotel do an exceptional job of keeping everything spotless on a daily basis.  The cleanliness of the rooms, balconies, and public areas is truly impressive, and a major advantage of Villa Lili over any other hotel I have seen in Puerto Escondido.  The staff are friendly and keen to help.  The fact that there are only seven rooms at Villa Lili enables the staff to provide a personalized level of service, and"
50,"If you'd like something that's a personal, authentic experience in Puerto Escondido, Villa Lili is for you. Villa Lili is owned by Adelina and her brother Luis, who grew up in Mexico City but started coming to Puerto Escondido before it was a tourist destination. As a result, they have a great knowledge of the activities and experiences that Puerto Escondido has to offer. Adelina helped us arrange a trip to see bioluminescence in the middle of the night, as well as a visit to a nearby beach to help baby sea turtles make their trip to water.  The other unique feature of Villa Lili is that delicious, traditional Mexican food is served for breakfast, including mole chicken and fish tacos, that is cooked with care and great skill by the small, friendly staff. Sauces and salsas are"
50,"The Suite was amazing (huge, great big bed perfect for two tall Europeans like us), the shower and bathroom was something to look forward to and the breakfast was outstanding! I am not usually someone to write perfect reviews but i must say Adelina and her Team of wonderful people made our stay in Mexico unforgettable. Not just was everyone so friendly and smiley but we got so much support, either for recommendations or travel arrangements that it made the holiday so much more relaxing. I would love to only recommend Villa Lili to my closest friends and family to keep it 'our little secret' but the Lili Team has worked so hard and makes such an effort that it is my duty to share our great experience with other travellers like us :)"
50,First time we stayed at Villa Lilla and we could enjoy more our stay in Puerto Escondido.  The host was such a great help. She gave us every information to organise our trip in Puerto Escondido and around. The room was very clean and spatious. A real pleasure to stay there. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay there.
50,"It was a no-brainer to come back to Villa Lili keeping in mind its homelike friendly environment. Yet since my previous visit Villa Lili has been improved even further. A new outdoor Jacuzzi pool appeared along with Chill Lounge area with a bar and ambient music on the background.   The balconies upstairs were pretty good for Yoga practice as well as the front deck that has been leveled and covered by tiles. So to find a spot for a Yoga mat was even easier. Besides, a perfect Yoga Retreat was hosted at the same time providing plenty of shaded space for the group's led class. The yard is still so large that the rest of guests haven't been disturbed or constrained.  There were so many interesting things to explore in Puerto Escondido, but returning to Villa Lili felt always like"
50,"It's the second time we stayed at villa lili and again we enjoyed it very much. The hotel is a very special place with a unique athmosphere. You feel like home, the staff is great, always friendly and ready to help out, whenever you have questions or need anything. The breakfast is just awesome. If we ever come back to Puerto Escondido we will for sure stay here again."
50,"We had a lovely 4 night stay at El Tucan, and the family that runs it is great! I reserved thru booking.com and ended up needing to extend our stay one night which was easy to do by emailing directly with the señora Lolita. She was very responsive to email and since I'm based in the US I ended up sending my deposit easily enough thru Western Union. The hotel itself has beautiful tiling and is very clean with new soaps given daily. Ask for a beach facing room and you even get your own little balcony. No AC but with the ceiling fan and a cold shower before bed we were fine. We loved the location as you could easily walk to the best beaches (15 min stroll from Manzanillo or Carrizalillo) and the adoquin market and restaurants in the evening. I would definitely return!"
50,"We were a group of 5 people staying at the hotel for 3 days and we all loved it! The location is great, half way between la playa principal and la playa manzanillo (5 minutes walking for each beach) and so also very close to the main street where you can find all kind of bars, restaurants and shops. Lolita and her family are very nice people. They helped us multiple times to organize our various excursions around Puerto Escondido. Note that the restaurant is close during the low season."
40,"My wife and I recently stayed in the Puerto Escondido area for a couple of weeks. We stayed at a few different places- Hotel Paraiso Escondido, which we love but a little out of our price range. Villas Mozart and Macondo, which is a great value and a perfect place to stay if you are going to be spending most of your time at playa carrizalillo. The last place we stayed was called ""El Tucan"". This ""bare bones"" basic hotel is a fantastic value at $25.00 USD/ night. It is run by a Mexican family who are extremely friendly. What we like about this place was that it was a brand new building and extremely clean. The location was also great for us. It is a block from Hotel Paraiso, which is centrally located. You can walk or take a 3 minute cab ride to playa carrizalillo or playa"
50,"We spent five amazing nights at Casa Beu, it's a charming property, well laid our, clean and safe.  Furthermore, it's only a short walk to La Punta, the most happening area in Puerto.  Morning breakfast of fruit, toast and coffee was excellent.  Furthermore, we had to change our reservation twice and both times they were very accommodation without any penalties or questions.  This place is highly recommended and I would definitely stay here again!!"
50,"We have stayed in many places in La Punta and by far this has been the best, so much so that we have stayed here over 10 times in the last few years. The rooms are perfect, big and have very comfortable beds with fan and air conditioning. The pool is a great place to chill and relax either during the day or when you come off the beach. And Isa and Diego are fantastic and make you feel very relaxed and welcome. Can’t recommend this place enough!!!! You will not be disappointed."
40,+ Great location at La Punta 5 min from the beach in a quiet street + Large room and very comfortable bed + Nice pool and common area + Great staff + Nice bathroom with good lighting and good shower pressure  - No internet access in the room - Sometimes no hot water (but this seems to be the case at several hotels in the area)
50,"Un Hotel Boutique , lindo, confortable, limpio y seguro, su ubicación es excelente apartado del bullicio pero a 2 calles de restaurantes y a 3 de la playa. La característica principal es la calidad y la disposición para ofrecerte un buen servicio. Alondra y Diego nos complacieron en todo lo que necesitamos y en muchas ocasiones rebasaron nuestras expectativas. Si lo que buscas es garantía éste es el lugar."
40,"Un hotel muy bonito con agradables detalles, ubicado a dos cuadras de la playa de Zicatela. Los encargados del hotel son amables y te apoyan en cualquier duda. El desayuno incluido es fruta, café y pan, pero muy cerca hay muchos lugares para comer a cualquier hora. "
40,"Todo está muy bien, menos la alberca. El agua está amarilla, solo hay 2 sombrillas para el hotel. La gente super amable, el niño que ayuda es super servicial  y muy acomedido. La ubicación es buena, a 3 calles de la playa punta Zicatela. El estado en general del hotel es excelente. "
50,"Muy bien ubicado (walking distance de la playa y restaurantes), excelente servicio, habitaciones amplias e impecables y un ambiente acogedor. Súper recomendando para una estancia inolvidable en Puerto Escondido! "
50,"Excelente estancia , a tan solo 15 minutos del aeropuerto de Puerto Escondido . A tan solo 3 cuadras de la Playa para practicar Surf o caminar y pasar un bien tiempo . Habitaciones excelentes, Instalaciones excelentes , servicio excelente , desayuno americano excelente , café Oaxaqueño excelente . La mejor estancia en Zicatela . 100% recomendado. "
50,"El hotel es una joya increíble en punta Zicatela, el cuidado al detalle es demasiado bonito y es súper cómodo, es un hotel boutique delicioso!. Me encanto mi estadía en este hotel y se lo recomiendo a cualquier persona que quería pasar un tiempo aquí. El personal es genial y te hacen sentir como en casa literalmente! Sobretodo Isa! Para tomar en cuenta que queda a unas 3 calles de la playa y de restaurantes y bares.   Si van a puerto escondido este lugar es un most! "
50,Great hotel and great location. Took only a couple minutes to walk to the beach but was still sheltered from Peurto's nightlife. The workers and guests are also very friendly which makes for a awesome experience. The breakfast is second to none.
50,"I recently spent two weeks in beautiful Puerto Escondido. Hotel Tabachin was fully booked, so we stayed down the hill at the much more expensive (and quite good but less distinctive) Hotel Santa Fe. Most mornings, we would walk up to the Tabachin for breakfast. The convivial atmosphere at the courtyard tables, presided over by the hotel proprietor Paul Cleaver, was a rare delight. The food is exceptional and the people we met there, many of whom had been coming back to the Tabachin for years and for extended stays, were welcoming and generous with helpful information and suggestions. The rooms that we saw had great character and some had breathtaking views. Paul Cleaver has encyclopedic knowledge of Oaxaca, and of Mexico, its history, geography and people. He is a generous and"
50,"The Hotel Tabachin is an excellent establishment. The character, service, location, breakfast and clean rooms are number one. The courtyard breakfast is the best. Meeting, visiting and having breakfast with guest from all over the world is a unique feature of this hotel. Paul the owner is very interesting and knowledgeable of the area. We will definitely be returning to this best kept secret."
40,"Even though we were booked into a different hotel we took a look around ""Tabachin"" on the recommendation of a friend and immediately cancelled our original reservation. Each room at ""Tabachin"" is unique and thoughtfully planned. We ended up in the spacious penthouse suite with balconies on 3 sides from which you can enjoy panoramic views of the beach and sea and appreciate the stunning sunsets. The hotel tariff is very reasonable and includes a comprehensive selection of breakfasts. Vegetarians have plenty of choice too! However, the real reason ""Tabachin"" is unique is due to the fascinating and stimulating conversation of it's owner Paul. A more cultured, gentle man one couldn't hope to meet. We're already looking forward to our next visit."
50,"We took a chance on this place after finding it in the Lonely Planet and it was definitely the right choice. The rooms are spacious and full of character, the breakfasts were the best we had in our two week tour of the Mexico and the location is perfect (right by the beach but set back from the road so noise isn't an issue).  Paul the owner tells great stories and has excellent book chat - he is very generous with his time and care for guests.  Tabachin is perfect for anyone who is looking for an interesting and charming experience in a unique property in Puerto Escondido."
50,"Our stay at Hotel Tabachin was a truly unique experience. Paul and his staff were delightful; friendly, courteous and efficient. We felt like we were staying with friends. Our room was spacious and uniquely furnished, with many books and good art. All in all Tabachin, Puerto Escondido and the vegetarian restaurants provided our best ever Mexican holiday."
40,"We stayed at Tabachin for 3 nights during a beach hopping holiday - having walked up and down the rest of Zictela it is definitely the place with the most character and being slightly back from the main beach walk it is nice and quiet. The room was a delight of Mexican tiles and various artwork Paul has collected - everything with its own story! A swimming pool was the only thing missing for me as a non-surfer, but not a problem as you can pay 30 pesos a day to use the bungalows zicatela pool which has fantastic sunloungers in the water, or alternatively the Santa Fe hotel pool. Highly recommend Tabachin and Paul a very gracious host."
50,"Tabachin is the ONLY place to stay in Puerto Escondido.  Ammenities like air conditioning and hot showers are only the tip of the iceburg.  It is set on a back street so it is quiet and serene but only 1 city block walk to Zicatela beach.  Each studio features a balcony with a perfect view of the city and the ocean.  Homemade made to order breakfast each morning is first rate, just ask the many locals who frequent Tabachin to enjoy the breakfast and Paul's wonderful company.  I have spent a considerable amount of time in Puerto and have visited many other hotels and apartments- Tabachin far exceeds what any other place can offer at a reasonable price.  Paul has an arrangement with the Santa Fe hotel so that if you need a break from the ocean, their pool is available to Tabachin"
50,"To describe Tabachin is one word. Magical. It's amazing views of the sea, soothing waves to put you to sleep. The rooms are very large, extremely comfortable, clean and spacious. I have been staying at this hotel since 1991, and it's truly one of my favorite spots in the world. It only gets better with time. The breakfast served in the morning is absolutely delicious, and the challenge is to try something different each day. It's so easy to slip into a favorite, but I suggest you sample as many as you can.  Paul is both hospitable and generous, but more than that, a very interesting and entertaining host who's goal is to guarantee that your time at his hotel is magical. For the past 20 years he has never let me down."
50,"Tabachin goes far beyond what you'd expect of any hotel. Where to begin? My (precious few) days at Tabachin were some of the most magical in my life.  It's not just the location -- mere minutes from a beautiful beach; or the views -- lush tropical vegetation rising toward a shimmering blue horizon; or the generosity and comfort of the rooms -- airy and clean, with a touch of home about them that defies the usual drive towards facelessness and sterility; or the delicious Mexican breakfasts -- always made to order from the freshest local produce. It's also the heartfelt warmth Paul puts into running his hotel: he is a gracious host full of insightful and wide-ranging conversation, helpful tips and genuine, down-to-earth caring. I came as a customer and left as a friend.  A truly"
40,"Lovely interior courtyard, rooftop terrace with great sunset view and ok bar.  Access to beach a couple of hundred feet.  Suggest avoiding key Mexican holidays -- the beach at that location gets flooded with regional visitors (some in buses just for a day or two)."
50,"Hosts: Paul and Joanne (Canadian) were charming and helpful. I booked direct through their website, which was easy. No deposit was requested, even though I stayed over Christmas, which I though was very trusting.  Room: Large, with juliet balcony looking over quiet street, which is a cul-de-sac ending on the beach, so very quiet. Separate area for storage of clothes and bags. Two large, very comfortable double beds. Cleaned daily. Bathroom with large shower area.  Location: Suited us well. Minute walk to Playa Marinero, a very large beach backing onto a lagoon, then a five minute walk along the beach to Playa Principal and the shops and restaurants of Alphonso Perez. On Christmas Day we walked on to reach Playa Manzanillo, which took about 20 minutes and had a lovely meal on the"
50,"The rooms are big and the beds are comfortable. We enjoyed the rooftop terrace with it's hammocks, pool and afternoon bar. You can get a beer, glass of wine, margarita or monitor and watch the sun set. Great restaurant. Owners Paul and Joanne are the best."
50,"I stayed here for 10 days and had great service and meals.  Paul and Joanne the owners treat you like family.  Clean rooms, and minutes to the beach and shopping. Joanne's kitchen is one of the best in all of Puerto. The roof top bar and pool gives a great view of sunsets every night.  I have now retired and live in Puerto and my week is never complete with out a dinner at the hotel and the best Mojito in town."
50,"I met Joanne and Paul back in 2007 when I was first introduced to Puerto Escondido by my brother in law. Since that first meeting, they made me feel as if I was like family. They truly know how to treat their guests. Clean rooms, Reasonable rates, Fantastic food, Excellent Service! If you need anything, you only have to ask. I have been back several times since, have taken my children and a few friends. My wife Kerry and I are heading to Puerto Escondido again this coming  February, and there is only one place we are going to stay. See you soon Paul & Joanne"
50,"I was introduced to the Hotel Flor de Maria by a Mexican friend I was traveling with. At MXP500 a night I still cannot believe the value!  It is just 3 minutes onto to the beach. They kindly allowed us to lock our motocycles in the basement.  Everything about this hotel was comfortable: beds, the rooftop pool, friendly service.  The rooms are spacious, and the hot water was plentiful. The hotel itself is quaint and so picturesque. Wi-fi was good and fast.  I would have loved to try the restaurant, but sadly my friend was always in a hurry of a morning and we never got to try the breakfast.  One warning.  There is no AC (understandable at the price), so the room may be too hot in the hottest season. For me, the fan was just adequate, but we did not go above 30C."
40,"After asking for recommendations from friends in Oaxaca City as to where to stay in Puerto Escondido, we were directed to Flor de Maria.    We spent five nights as guests of Joanne and Paul and their staff.  Our room was very comfortable and clean.  The hotel itself is 'quaint' in our estimation and the long-time staff treat you as though you are welcome guests in their home.  The rooftop is wonderful...a small, refreshing pool; comfortable chairs and loungers; a bartendress; a small sandwich menu; shade, a constant breeze and a million dollar beach view.  The hotel is on a short street between the main road into town and Marinara Beach.  A great, quiet location.  A two-minute walk takes you to a good swimming beach.  The hotel restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner.  The"
50,"We had only planned on staying at the Flor de Maria for three days.  It didn't take but 24 hours to realize that a move would be a big mistake.  You can read all the other posts and get a good feel for this hotel.  Great  restaurant, quiet back street, near the beach, terrific roof patio with bar and pool, etc.  but what really sets this hotel apart are the owners, Paul and Joanne.  I have never met such helpful, welcoming, gracious hosts.  My wife and I stayed for two weeks.  Most of the guests come back year after year.  That in itself speaks volumes.  Have fun in PE and say hello to Paul and Joanne for us."
50,"We found Hotel Flor de Maria after having fled the worst hotel ever and felt that we had been ""saved"". Once we met Paul and Joanne (the owners) we knew we had arrived ""home"" Everything about this hotel and restaurant was excellent and comfortable- from the beds, the rooftop pool and bar to the excellent food and service in the restaurant. Joanne, in addition to being the owner, is also the head chef, and the offerings each night rotated and had vegetarian entree, all of the dishes we tried were delicious.  The highlight of our stay was watching the sunset from the rooftop bar.  If we go back to Puerto Escondido, we will definitely stay here."
50,"We've stayed twice now (2 years in a row) at the Flor de Maria - it is perfect in every respect!  A beautiful hotel, superb staff and service, and an excellent restaurant.  Paul and Joanne (the owners) are lovely, warm people and really make the hotel what it is.  We will return, again and again, because it is simply the best!"
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed for just over a week at Casa De La Gente Nube during our travels of Mexico and felt extremely welcome there.  We very kindly offered to have our room ungraded by the owner as it was available during our time there. Both the first and the second rooms were very comfortable and had lovely sea views breaking through a canopy of native trees - the sunsets from which were spectacular.   Rooms were clean and maintained well during our stay and a small breakfast buffet was on offer each morning for a very reasonable price.  The hotel is family run and that gives the place its welcoming and friendly vibe. The owner himself was a legend, a super chilled guy who spoke great English and who was more than helpful during our time there - at the end of our stay he"
40,"The hotel is quite basic, but very well located,  with nice staff and a nice atmosphere. You should not book it when you are into luxury hotels,  but if basic is ok for you,  I can totally recommend it. The breakfast is very good and comes at a low price. "
50,"Not only have they hit the mark when it comes to simple yet stylishly decorated rooms, this place will leave you aw struck with the unbelievably high quality of the food. Me and my boyfriend booked for one night, and were planning on eating out. Luckily the owner of this stylish pad intrigued us with their catch of the day menu. MY WORD!! We had eaten well during our Mexican adventure, but nothing came close to what we experienced here!! A young 19  going onto 20 year old sous chef blew us away- first with a grilled dorade topped with the most exquisite self made and roughly chopped nut sauce that was accompanied by finely sliced root vegetables. Secondly he awed is with a divine guava + crumble concoction ( decorated with home grown mint leaves) and lastly ( only because we"
50,"Best new restaurant in Puerto and you won’t be disappointed! Everything is made with love and magic hands! Gorgeous cuisine with a beautiful sunset view. Great breakfasts too! The ceviche, salad, prawns, mussels  , octopus & desserts were exceptional! I want to go back again tomorrow!😍🤗🏆 Tell your friends because they will love it. Just on the highway across from the military base."
50,"Simple room with no air con. Spotlessly clean. All staff is amazing from top to bottom. Great wifi, hot water, super close to Zicatela Beach. The real highlight of Casa de la Gente Nube is the restaurant. Hector provides amazing service. The food here is the best I had in Puerto Escondido. Absolutely fantastic."
50,"Super clean place, very nice bed, very attentive and friendly people, delicious food (CHEF made us taste Oaxaca in every bite), we spent the new year in their restaurant and it was a wonderful experience, VERY recommendable !!"
50,"I stayed at Casa de La Gente Nube for four nights. It is super clean. The rooms are very comfortable with a huge bed. Bathroom is clean with hot water and towels provided. There is a writing desk, deck with chairs and view of the ocean. Five minutes walk to the main strip but far enough away that it is quiet. Very reasonably priced. The owners are very kind and helpful. I highly recommend this place. "
50,"We stayed upstairs for one night and in the brand new rooms downstairs for two nights, beautiful rooms with fans and clean new bathrooms. Location was PERFECT, ocean views and great breeze into the rooms. The owner is lovely and has great information about the area, you can ask him for anything. This place is a work in progress and will only get better, could not recommend more highly"
50,"I have heard good things about the hostel throughout my trip through México and therefore decided to book 3 days. In the end I stayed for 3 weeks. I love this place, the staff and the vibe in general. Especially through the activities with Romy we quickly grew together to a big family and extended our stay again and again. The rooms are really big, it doesn't get too hot at night because of the many fans, the kitchen has everything you need and the pool is unique. The hostel is not quite centrally located but this makes you explore much more and also the tourist areas are within easy reach."
20,"I would AVOID this place until the owner reevaluates the staff he’s hired. A member of the staff tried to actually fight me while having a disagreement about the social events of the night prior. He stated that since I accidentally knocked over and broke a beer bottle that I did not know how to behave while drinking and would not be allowed to stay here anymore. Even though this is Puerto Escondido (a party vacation destination) and I was not the only one drinking, this guy must have some pretty serious personal issues to try and physically assault a guest. I also recall that prior to this he was oddly cold and unwelcoming as if he had a pre existing issue. I’ve worked in several hostels and stayed in 100s I would avoid this place if you want to feel safe and welcome on your"
50,Had a lot of fun at the hostel and it is good value.  The vibe is really cool.  I liked the pool and the staff was cool.  They took me out and I enjoyed myself.  Barney was cool.  Plus breakfast was great value
50,"First night stepped into my room (no hot water, no air conditioning)  than I realized it’s been 5 hours since I left home I’m in Mexico  after one time using shower  decided I’m enjoying the pool  nice and warm only thing is everyone relaxing in hammocks or lounging around want to know where you from “hey we’re going to the lagoon wana come?). Or the owners asking if you want to join the volunteers for BBQ dinner tonight  it does set you back about 4$  And everyone joins together to prepare food for friends they just meet but if not hungry someone still wants to tell you about there day    Word of caution you book this hostel for one night.  Good luck explaining to your boss back home why you need more vacation time."
50,"What an absolutely amazing hostel! We only intended to stay 3 days and ended up spending the whole 2 weeks of our stay. We felt like we were a part of the team by the end and found it so difficult to say goodbye. Whether you are looking for a party or just somewhere to chill out, this hostel offers both. The vibes are beautiful! The breakfast chats are golden! and the pool is amazing! You might even get to meet the hostel turtle while you are in there 😊   By the end of our trip, I think we had almost stayed in all the private rooms all of which have their own pros and cons. Some are brighter than others, some have better beds, some better pillows but overall for how cheap it is you really can’t complain. Yes the showers are cold but you don’t really need hot water considering"
50,"It was a great journey in this hostel. We had a lot of fun thanks to all the staff and a big up to Leanne the manager she is perfect !!  Great location, you can book everything from there, staffs are really helpful and friendly ! The breakfast is really nice!  We wanted to stay forever !  We will recommend this hostel 100% !!! Our love Valentine and Clara"
50,"If you are afraid of heights I wouldn’t recommend this attraction. You go up to the top and walk on a glass walk way. I took my daughters and my grand children two of which were in buggies and it was easy access for us all. There were many very interesting displays and the people on hand were well informed, friendly and very helpful. Although it was very busy, we did not feel pressured to move quickly through it. Very interesting and historical, I highly recommend."
50,"What a wonderful hostel! It has a nice big layout with a very inviting and cozy yard, a nice and clean pool, a lot of cozy hammocks and an overall very nice atmosphere allowing you to chill and hang out and truly enjoy your vacation. Their beach shuttle brings you to the different beaches nearby and the hostel bar offers a nice choice of yummy and really good cocktails at super-cheap prices. The last managers changed a lot of things around the hostel, so reviews from more than half a year ago can be considered outdated, since the place has turned into more of a nice and relaxed hang out place rather than a ranging party hostel. They still drink, party, dance and have fun there, so overall it is the perfect mix of layed back and active fun!"
50,"So This hostel is very good!  But! One from the staff is very mean, her name is Ingrid! Like we couldn’t get a private room because it was booked... very mean :/ AND she didn’t know when the busses leave to chochala... she did give US the wifi password so that was okay, but still!!  And forced US to drink bad Wine and didn’t Want to play flip cup :/   Best regards Nikolaj"
50,"We have been so glad that we ended up booking our stay at Shavanna. There are lots of other accommodation types in Puerto Escondido, but the hotel was the best option for us. It has a very nice feel & design, a great breakfast & dining/lounge area on the top floor and great staff. The location was very good - it's minutes away from the centre which we visited often, 15-20 minutes walk from Rinconada where there are lots of restaurants & cafes and the 2 best beaches: Carrizallilo & Playa Manzanillo. We especially wanted to thank Eddie Diaz for assisting us in navigating around Puerto Escondido & making best arrangements with local service providers. He was extremely patient, courteous & friendly. We look forward to visiting Puerto Escondido and staying at Shavanna again."
50,"We had a great stay at tower bridge. They have a really cool pool, and a generally a chill vibe. Plus I like the hammocks, tablefootball, and bar; it was a very social place. Rooms were decent, it is a hostel so it wasn't that luxurious perhaps, but we stay in hostels because it is a fun place. Really friendly staff too. Perhaps a bit far from the beaches, but they offer a free shuttle."
50,"Came with some mates to use the pool and amenities for a small price redeemable against drinks and was absolutely blown away. Socks = knocked off. The service was the best I've experienced, the man behind the bar was so attentative, helpful and welcoming. When I think about him now my heart warms bro. As travellers with small budgets it was heartwarming to be treated like hotel guests. The atmosphere was amazing and everything was super well priced. Best cocktails in Mexico so far😋😋 🥂🍾"
50,"My flight got messed up back to Oaxaca so I found myself in need of a room for one night. Booked online but called to see if I could check in early and they said yes. I really appreciated that, and was able to have breakfast and sit by the beautiful pool all day. The place is clean, quiet and beautiful. It's not on the beach but a beautiful place to stay."
50,"Sha Anna Hotel was just what we needed as we began to wind down our trip.   The place was super clean, quiet and reasonable, the tri-factor for these seasoned travelers.  The rooms are spacious and super comfortable.  The pool area is great, Eddy makes the best margaritas..priced right and located away from the mayhem. "
40,"The pool is great! :-) I really like the modern art deco style. There was a lot of money and attention put in that place. It was very quiet when we were there in low season, as it is in the middle of Puerto Escondido itself and not by the beaches, but it is the best spot to experience local food in a less touristic area. The room was small but very comfortable with proper AC and nice bathroom and toiletries. Good for the price. I really liked the poolside setup. Also, the staff was super helpful with everything. The only negative point was maybe the very high price of the cocktails at the bar and the lack of diversity for the breakfast offered with the room (only fruits with yogurt, they ran out of bread). I would recommend that hotel!"
50,"The Shavanna Hotel was a lovely hotel choice.  I would highly recommend it on many levels. The service was the best I have EVER received in a hotel.  Full, personal attention was given by all employees we encountered.  The room was clean and the air conditioning worked great.  We were visiting Puerto Escondido for 11 days.  The front counter person, Anna, was extremely helpful and spoke English very well.  The breakfast kitchen team, Leticia, Orlando and Eddie were kind, courteous and eager.  We also had excellent service from Eddie, the shuttle driver.  He took us to many places other than just the beach.  Helped us at the bank and was fun to practice our Spanish with.  The shower was lovely- lots of room. The bathroom itself is very small with few places to put things so"
30,"We stayed here for 3 nights starting Christmas day, and while it was not an unpleasant stay, there is a lot of things that we wish were better.  The hotel is new, the rooms are clean, they have shuttles twice a day to nearby beaches and the staff is friendly (and give you a chance to practice your Spanish). They allowed us to check in at 8 am as soon as we arrived, no fuss. All this is good.  On the not-so-good side, we had a very peculiar room. We stayed in 106, a poolside suite. The pool-facing bar is right outside the room, so expect loud semi-drunken conversations from the guests to drill into your ears if you're trying to sleep before 11 pm. The room has frosted glass slats for windows, and no curtains, so light streams in from outside at night. The hotel has decided it is"
50,"The hotel is super nice, it's a nice boutique hotel, brand new,  the hotel is exactly as you see in pictures. The staff is super nice, they have a transfer to the beach 2 times a day and to the airport. Elias was our bartender and was super nice, they give you a cocktail when you arrive and is super good. In general our experience was great. The only thing they cool improve is the breakfast thas is included. they gave us a tiny cup of yogourt, with bread that was a bit old, some fruit, juice and jelly. For sure they could improve it, some eggs, or chilaquiles, or pancakes will give a 10 to our experience in the hotel."
50,"We are so happy with everything about this beautiful little Boutique Hotel. The central location the clean pretty modern architecture, the exceptional staff, the refreshing pool, the artisan Drinks, the scrumptious food and most of all our perfect room. We got a one bedroom suite with a kitchen on the bottom floor right outside the pool... WOW. Everything I was looking for and more. This Boutique has exceeded my expectations in so many ways, it's making our stay wonderful. Gilbert the manager is professional and personable very helpful and gracious. Anna the front desk attendant is helpful attentive impeccably bilingual and goes above and beyond to make any request happen. Bravo Anna. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for excellence on Puerto"
50,"For me this was a great stay.  Booked it at last minute and it couldn't be better.  The manager and the service was amazing! The ride from the hotel to the beach is nice to get to know the area.  The breakfasts are great, the butter extremely yummy and the drinks at the bar are spectacular!  "
50,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Aqua Luna.Its just off the Zicatela Strip allows easy beach access without the crowds or noise. The owners and managers Adriana and Clive are very attentive and hospitable without being overwhelming ,as is the staff. You could not ask for better hosts.  You will meet people from every part of the planet at the Aqua Luna.  The rooms are super clean and spacious. The pool restaraunt/ bar and rooftop jacuzzi makes everything easy and provides a mellow but sociable atmosphere.  If your not doing to well at the pool table in the afternoon,  there is always hope for a win at a friendly game of Texas hold em ...just don't misdeal or your wind up paying for it with a grande mescal shot... not pretty.....If you like Puerto you will surely love the Luna! "
20,"Sorry guys,  we liked the location alright, the room was clean and simple, but your customer service skills are lacking.  Adriana seems like the sort of person that is nice to a selective group of people.  I, being a gringa, wasn't included in that range of people.  We could have booked additional nights but decided it was actually worth lugging our packs and boards to another hotel.  Mala vibra and too much attitude. Oh yeah, and this place is loaded with Aussie spongers."
50,"I stayed here over a year ago so this review is a little late but, as I consider it one of the highlights of my trip, I wanted to let everyone know how good it is.  Aqua Luna is like one of those little boutique hotels that normally cost an arm and a leg. The art deco style building wouldn't look out of place in Miami, and inside the rooms are minimalist and spotlessly clean. This might not be to everyone's taste but I found it a nice change from the 'beach hut' look of most hotels in the area.  The public areas of the hotel are also very nice. There's an inviting pool and a thatched-roof restaurant area with a pool table and darts board. Food and drink is of the cheap and cheerful variety - handy for a quick bite but head into town if you plan to make a night of it.  Not being"
50,"The hotel had great facilities, but as a solo traveller the best part was there was always someone keen for a night out, up for a surf, game of cards or pool. Made some great friends. Clive and Adriana who own the hotel were always there and ready to help with anything they are amazing. You dont get to meet the owners of your hotel very often!! I highly recommend Aqua Luna and i will definately be going back."
50,"I do not usually take the time to write a review but this was one of the best holiday experiences I have ever had. I had no idea when I booked this hotel what a great time I was in for. Clive and Adriana are amazing hosts. I have never felt so relaxed and taken care of without being smothered. Low key and cool, relaxed and casual, everything you could want from a vacation. It's the real deal in Mexico!! Great surf tips and you gotta try the homemade pies hot out of the oven! Wicked."
50,"We stayed here in late May 2008, and this is easily one of the best and most fun hotels I have ever stayed in. For $25 a night, this place is an absolute bargain, rooms are minimalist and sleek and the pool and bar area is an excellent place to socialise. One of the best places I stayed on my 2 month trip around Mexico. The bar food is also excellent and very good value. Hope to come back here again."
50,"this place is sensational, a relief from the other hotels in the same price range.  You feel like you are in boutique hotel and the service is excellent.  The pool is great and it is a great place to relax.  If you are in puerto you must stop here.  Our only criticsm is of ourselves -  we should have stopped longer!"
50,"What an amazing hotel!  Everything you need is right here, with a great pool, bar and entertainment area.  The service by the Aqua Luna staff was excellent. Unfortunately, we missed Clive and Adriana, but we were still taken care of really well by the other beautiful staff.   Great food cooked by the lovely Carrell.  All in all, not a place to be missed.  This hotel will make your Puerto Escondido experience one not to be forgotten."
50,"From the moment i stepped foot onto the property Clive, Adriana and the Aqua Luna team were there offering their knowledge, experience and immaculate services. Very comfortable rooms, great bar, friendly and well spoken english and mexican staff. Already planning the trip back next year. Hasta Luego!  "
50,"You couldn´t get a better holiday experience! Adrianna and Clive have the highest standards - immaculate rooms, sparkling clean pool, thick fluffy towels and warm, knowledgable staff. It is by far the best place we have stayed in Mexico. 1 street back from the beach and from the main restaurant and shopping scene but so, so peaceful. Rooms are spacious, have their own lounging area and kitchen and are cleaned thoroughly every day!  Initially we booked in for 2 days and ended up staying for 9. The atmosphere is relaxed, friendly but very professional and consequently  guests were happy and sociable. We rented a room with only cold water shower and this was fine. You spend so much time swimming at the beach and in the pool that there really is no need for the hot shower on hot"
50,"Great place to stay in Puerto Escondido!! The staff here is great, Federico will make you a great breakfast and Cecilia and Guillermo are excellent hosts. They will make sure you have a great time! The hotel is very nicely located between the important beaches. It is only a short walk anywhere in the town. The hotel itself has A/C and a beautiful pool if you don't feel like going anywhere. The views are also incredible from the top floor suites! Highly recommend! Muchas gracias!!"
50,"I love this hotel.  Not new, not fancy, but clean, well maintained, and full of charming, whimsical details. Family run. Sergio and his daughter Francesca are splendid hosts who speak excellent English, if you need it. A/C, TV, lovely pool in an equally lovely garden. Ok WiFi (great Wifi does not exist on the Oaxaca coast. Discount for cash. Easy walk to the Adoquín and the beach. Restaurant/bar was temporarily closed during my stay but will reopen soon.  All very old fashioned and very Mexican, and quite affordable.  Highest recommendation!"
50,"Great location - a short walk to the beach Great cleanliness - faultless Great staff - amazing, helpful, friendly and superb language skills  Ideal for the beach or just by the perfect pool area.  Highly recommended. Based on the above we chose to extend our stay from 1 week to 2 weeks. "
50,The people that work at the hotel are super nice plus very responsive to giving the best service to offer I’m very happy with them and I’d love to stay again with them. The rooms are always in great conditions and the workers are  always there in case anything is needed. Plus the location is very good and the vew to the bay is amazing.
50,We supposed to stay just for one night but since the place was so nice and comfy we stayed another night! The hotel has such a nice Mexican style and the take care of every single detail. The staff is so friendly and helpful including the owner and the location is perfect close to everything. Definitely recommended! 
50,Had a great stay here thanks to it’s location and great staff. The hotel is located in town not too far from a few of the local beaches where you can swim or surf. Hotel staff were very friendly and can make great recommendations for places to eat and things to do.
30,"some years ago now, but I can see, it's the same :) In the morning a girl to make and serve breakfast - in the afternoon/ evening one person only, in the reception - it worked. :) We didn't needed help and the room was made up and clean every day! The garden and pool a nice place to relax.(Total it was 4- 6 guests only.) We went out for breakfast and dinner the next 2 days.  A lot of restaurants, all meals - around the corner, 5 - 10 min. walk. The main beach ""Bahia Principal"" worldwide known for surfers as "" Pipeline"" Cozy beach for swimming go to Playa Carrizalillo!"
50,"Really comfortable hotel with lovely old buildings, friendly staff and a great pool area. Air con, good bathroom facilities, and a laundry a hundred metres away. The taco place on the corner is incredible for al pastor as well."
40,"A Hotel that deserves a 4.5 as there was little room for improvement other than the bed was a little to hard for my wifes liking. Sergio was a great a help in our requests for information and directions in both Spanish and English. He hooked us up with Gina for a tour and Turtle release that was the hilight of our trip. We stayed in suite 1 which was over sized, with a kingsized bed and a great view of the ocean and beaches from a nice, private balcony. The decore and architecture of the Hotel was artistic and appealing with great stone and masonary works. Thank you to Sergio and Stafff for a great stay in Puerto and the Hotel Paraiso, hasta luego!"

Also the location is in the old center very farway from the nice main beaches. For this price we were expecting to have a better hotel than the ones just in front the nice beaches and restaurants but it was much more expensive.... so I still do not understand why going there when there are so much good hotel in front of the nices beaches and cheaper.... We could also ear the neighbours...."
50,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights in late April.  When I emailed a question about beach towels (which they provide) they responded with an offer of a free upgrade to the  master suite, which we graciously accepted.  We were greeted by Magda and Adelina and shown our spacious room.  It took up the whole top floor and included a hot tub and and second floor sun deck.  Breakfast every morning was cooked by Magda, who made  a delicious and better than restaurant quality Oaxacan meal each time, along with fresh fruit, juice and coffee.  Adelina, and her cute young son Moritz, always greeted us to offer tips, find out our plans and just chat all in fluent English (for those who don't speak Spanish).   The location can't be beat, 7 minute walk to  Playa Carrizalillo and 10 minute"
50,"There are so many wonderful things to say about Quinta Lili, from the beautiful building, to the pleasant and ultra accommodating staff, to the delicious and intimate outdoor breakfast setups for the guests each morning. But the best part about it, in our opinion, is the location. It's about as close as you can get to Playa Carrizalillo (10 min walk) and there are about a dozen restaurants right down the street (5 min walk). Probably not the best location if you're trying to spend all your time in Zicatela, but we found ourselves taking a cheap taxi that way almost every day for one reason or another and it was as easy as easy gets. This place is like a little bed and breakfast, not a hotel, and the family who owns it and their awesome staff are super friendly and were"
50,"We adored our stay at Quinta Lili! We spent 5 nights in March and couldn't have loved it more. They were easy to communicate with before we arrived and were extremely warm, kind, and helpful once we were there -- Adelina helped my husband set up a birthday surprise for me (such gorgeous flowers!!), and after we left, even helped return some items I'd left behind.   We loved our second-floor room with a balcony -- we sat outside most nights with a drink as the sun went down. Other highlights -- absolutely delicious breakfasts, the honor bar with delicious beer (that they make!), the 5-minute walk to gorgeous Carazilillio beach.   We thought our room was a real value for the quality, and would go back again in a minute!"
50,"Loved everything about this place. Lili is a 5 room boutique hotel. It is centrally located conveniently within walking distance to the main drag with plenty of restaurants,shops and superettes. There is a beach within 10 minutes from their front door. An authentic Mexican breakfast awaits you every morning. I could go on & on but I would like to keep this place secret. "
50,"QL was simply amazing!!! Spotless rooms and villa, welcoming down to earth hosts, amazing local breakfast served everyday by the pool, all outings organised  for you, could have not asked for better time away from home!..."
50,"This was our 2nd visit, the first being in 2013.  Everything was how we remembered it.  The staff really makes your stay. The daily breakfast was outstanding. The location is excellent, close to a wonderful beach and the best restaurants. Everyday the proprietor checked in with us to assist with tour plans and whatever else we needed. The small size is perfect, you get to know the other guests and still feel as though you have privacy.  The rooms are quiet and the beds comfortable. We were able to swim, snorkel and stand up paddle board at playa carrazalillo.  It was hotter than expected, but the ceiling fan kept us cool at night. Hope to return to this spot in the future."
50,"We stayed at Quinta Lili for 2 weeks in March and it surpassed all expectations.  The proprietor Adelina is fluent in English and available to give advice, organize tours and ensure that the guests every need is met.  The location is so tranquil and the only noise you will hear are the local birds. The premises are impeccably kept with a small dipping pool for cooling off.  Honour bar system in place with a variety of drinks including Adelina's home brew.   The staff are so friendly and continually helped us to improve our Spanish. Magda is an amazing cook and breakfast was such a delight each morning.  The property is less than ten minutes from Playa Carizallillo and just 5 minutes walk to a great strip of restaurants.   I would return in a heartbeat to this beautiful oasis."
50,"My son and i loved our stay at QL. We stayed in the top room with gorgeous views, amazing breezes, generous space, sweet little private jacuzzi, and the hotel nearly to ourselves. The quiet location took some getting used to as our ears are accustomed to the 24/7 loudness of NYC. While the hotel is in a safe and peopled neighborhood, the building in particular is surrounded by empty space, only 2 other buildings on the block. This belies the warm oasis inside.   Adelina and her team were amazing with abundant and delicious breakfast options --- fresh fruits, cereals, tacos de tinga/de pescado/de papa, fresh juices, eggs, toast--- so good!  Adelina was warm and welcoming and helped us to organize trips and find tasty restaurants and special spots. Oasis surf shop is just a 5"
50,"Just returned from 8 night stay At the Quinta Lili and would return in a heartbeat. It is all one would want from a botique hotel.The hotel is small and contains 5 units that are generous in size.The location is within 300-400 meters of a beach(an easy walk) and the upper rooms have an ocean view.We stayed in the master suite which is the highest and largest room in the hotel and has an ocean view, well worth the additional cost. The hotel is implecably maintained by a friendly and attentive staff under the direction of Adelina a welcoming caring person and also the proprietor. A delicious Breakfast is served daily and the kitchen is flexible to your requirements. Quinta Lily is located in the western side (quieter ) and is close to good restaurants and shoppes(5-7 minute walk)."
50,"We just stated for a second time at Qunita Lili and it was as amazing as it was the first time. The hospitality is second to none, they make you feel like family. We stayed in the Sunrise Room and it was very spacious and had a great terrace with ocean views to sit and relax after a day at the beach.  Walking distance to great beaches and restaurants. Breakfast was amazing everyday. Adelina, Magda, Francisco and all staff are the best. We would not hesitate to return in the future."
40,"I stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and clean.  And while some may prefer a hotel that is located on the beach or in the center of the tourist action, I liked staying here, in an actual Mexican neighborhood.  Away from the worst of the nightlife and noise, the Barlovento is just a short walk to the beach, shopping, restaurants, etc.  There's also a good restaurant on site, and a small family owned tienda just around the corner with grocery items and very inexpensive internet service.  On the downside, the air conditioner in my room was very loud -- I wore earplugs to drown out the sound -- but it worked well, which was a blessing at this time of year in Puerto Escondido."
50,"went on my honeymoon - wife doesn't like to surf, I wanted lessons to get better. Stayed in the top room with our own lookout over La Punta. There was red wine in our room on arrival. The bed was huge and comfortable. The lessons we're exactly what I wanted: 8-10 every morning, 1-1 tuition, point breaks, lots of tips and pointers. My wife sat on the beach and read and then I hung out with her on sun loungers - eating amazing mango and drinking beer with lime juice in it until about 4pm when I went for another surf. Lots of good spots to eat in La Punta and on Zicatela in the evening.   I've stayed in other surf houses before in Portugal, Morocco, the UK - this one was the best"
50,"Everything is really good:  First the location: it's in ""la punta"" the really cool place in Puerto Escondido.  The house is really clean with all the comfort you need. Very quiet. A really good place to rest and forgot everything.  Last but not least the staff: all the surf instructors are really really great: they will give you perfect advice and will show patience and laugh with you in the water.  A big thanks to David, Neiser, CoCo y Julio aka el muñeco.  Always remember: siempre hay olitas.!!"
50,Puerto Surf House was definitely my best surf house I have ever been to. Not only the house itself is clean but the staff is super friendly and helpful. It's a place where you feel safe and comfortable instantaneously.  The surf lessons are very helpful too. My surf skills have improved drastically after two weeks of lessons. Instructors were very patient with the students and will ensure you catch good waves regardless the condition.  I cannot wait to be back.
50,"I stayed here during my spring break for 5 days.  The location was perfect. Right by the beach and just behind the local eateries.  The Surf instructors were so friendly and very helpful.   The host family made me feel right at home the moment I arrived.   Also, I recommend the breakfast package and the Spanish lessons.  Juan personalizes the lessons to you learning style and is very flexible with the schedule.    It is the best place to stay in la punta puerto escondido."
50,"Puerto Surf House is very recommendable! The house and rooms are clean and beautiful. The stuff is friendly and helpfull in every situation. Swantje speaks a perfect English, Spanish and German which helps a lot to communicate- even in advance. I arrived late and David showed me the room and the kitchen. The ocean is very close, some restaurants, shops and coffees as well. The garden is amazing. I loved to surf with David and his team- i improved a lot and we had good fun. Its easy to rent a board if you like to stay longer. The atmosphere is great, good vibes all the time. Its a little paradise and so nice to share with David, Swantje, the kids and other travellers! Thank you for the great stay"
50,"The staff was great from the start when I wrote to check out when was the best time to come up to the end making you feel well at home and taken care of. The surf classes were great and the team was really patient with me and my 8yo daughter. A nice surprise was the things walking distance/ just across the street, from the hotel: the beach to start off with but also cute little shops and restaurants WITH VEGAN options, definitely a vacation worthy of more than just 5 days. We feel not only more relaxed but healthier as well!"
40,"We had a great time surfing everyday with Naesser, Coco and the world famous Muñeco (Julio)! We really enjoyed the surfhouse and the location was great! Sleep to the sound of the waves and be in the water by 7:30! Great place, great people -we'll go back next year with our daughter!"
50,"Puerto surf house is a perfect place to stay, peace full and quiet, located close to the beach and the little shops and restaurants of la Punta. David the owner is very nice and helpful with all kind of problems that might occur. If you travel alone it is a great place to meet other likeminded surfing people and still gives you the freedom to stay on your own if you like. Nice, neat and tidy rooms. This place offers everything you need for a relaxing holiday."
50,"Swift reply on questions and prior reservation, easy payment, clean and a very nice building. There is always somebody for help, advice or just having a nice chat. If you search privacy or like to meat people; both is possible. The garden invites you to read a book in the hammocks or have breakfast on the table. Drinking water is provided and always available. Around a 5 minutes walk you have good restaurants for dinner or breakfast, bars, shops to buy beer and the most important needs, fruits and vegetables. If you go on a trip ask la señora of the restaurant ""la playita"" if she can prepare you some  ""tortas"" (sandwiches). She prepared us our lunch at 5 o'clock in the morning! If you like to party or have a broader selection of restaurants take a taxi to Zicatela (there are"
50,"We spent one week at Puerto Surf House and were very satisfied with our choice! The place is beautiful, calm and clean, free use of kitchen and super friendly people. Just three steps away from the beach, coffees and restaurants - in one of the most relaxed areas of Puerto Escondido. If you surf or not, this is a great place to stay and to enjoy the beach and sun – and to rest and relax!"
10,"The beach club is nice but the service very disappointing. The staff seems to be not interested in their jobs. Not friendly at all.  We visited many times for the last 3 years , and always loved it there. Too bad!  "
30,"the hotel is clean and was very quiet when I was there .  English is not easily spoken at thus resort if that is a concern for you .  My waiter spoke none has di the front desk when I checked . The food is not good here that is for sure , the  beach club is excellent .   it is also not near much and no stores , they know that so they charge a lot more like things like a coke  50 peso   17 at a store"
30,"I stayed there for 5 days between Christmas and new year eve. The room is clean. The breakfast area is very noisy and not welcoming at all, you won’t stay long. The beach club is not far and the shuttle service works well. They land you towels but they scrutinize it everyday to check if they can charge you for cleaning. Overall, this is an ok place, this is just convenient, don’t expect anything else."
40,"Hotel Suites Villasol met the basic requirements of cleanliness, free breakfast, and swimming pool (two swimming pools which was a nice surprise). The food was mediocre, and the service was not consistently good at the restaurant on the main grounds. The restaurant at the swimming club, Pez Gallo, was superior and a perfect location to revel in the stunning view of the beach and sunset. The tour operating company in the lobby was a disappointment since I had scheduled to go on a tour on our last day and I didn't find out until the morning of - just 45 minutes prior to our supposed tour- that our tour had been cancelled. We managed to find other alternatives, but the lack of professionalism was a letdown."
50,"Very simple basic room. Very clean, quiet. The room have a screen in patio door.  Not on the see but a fantastic pool and a beach club 15 min walk (or shuttle). You do not pay for being on see but it is a very pleasant place. Super well manage. The management is a little bit restrictive (example, you have to pay a deposit of 300$ to rent a bike... or they are very strict on hotels rules etc...) in everything, but the good side is you have a serious place. Good location, you can walk from airport (less than 2 km).  Good breakfast and restaurant is OK at night. Good value."
40,I live here and friends who visit from USA consistently enjoy this hotel. The pool club is popular and I visit often. A note to travellers. Chill out! Food service everywhere is on Mexico time. You are expected to relax have a drink talk to each other.  What's the rush anyway? You can spend an hour enjoying the views and friends and no one will rush you out! It's in line with no fast food joints. Relax and enjoy!
40,"This is a Beach Club review only - Not the hotel - Its a 200 peso entry for each person, but you get to apply that towards food and beverage, so if you want to eat and drink it a fairly good deal.  The pool is big, the bathrooms are very nice and the chairs, tables and umbrellas are great. The cushions are faded not like the picture.  The staff is very friendly and attentive!! Easy beach access. Bring towels, they are not provided unless you are a hotel guess and then maybe you can get some.  The food is decent pool food.  A good selection and portions.  Strawberry Daiquiris were great for kids (non alcohol).  A nice change of pace but off the beaten path a bit. Not walkable, but a 40-50 peso cab ride from PE. If you are looking for a variety this was a nice change for us!"
50,"Clean, safe, the beach club is awesome. They have an employee named Isabell who speaks perfectly English and will help you order breakfast and avoid getting lost, she is very sweet. Everyone there is fantastic. The only complaint is that it is a long walk to the main touristy parts of town."
50,"I have returned to Puerto Escondido after a four year absence, staying from January 20 to February 17.  I stayed at the VillaSol and can't say enough good things about this hotel.  Starting with excellent management by Pedro Medina Martinez and followed by an extremely hard working and competent staff in all areas of the hotel.  My room was cleaned and  maintained beautifully by the many wonderful housekeeping staff among whom some of these employees were:  Antonia, Marta, Raquel, Sacnite, and so many more whose names I have forgotten.  Always friendly and helpful and eager to help even if my Spanish was very bad.  The gardener/landscape person was Alejandro - the hardest working man I've seen in ages.  Always friendly and a real gentleman doffing his hat when greeting me - old"
50,"My family passed an excelent time in this hotel, the staff is very nicely and gentile, the hotel has a restaurant with very good  service and just price, the beach club of the hotel are awesome and very safe for childrens. In general is an excelent place and we will try to return soon. "
50,"We returned after a prior visit 8 years ago,  The Hotelito retained its friendliness, quiet and a great pool.  The guests were friendly and there ususally an informal happy hour gathering at the end of the day.  The hosts were all ways around to help which saved our trip when we coul not open the safe to get our passports -problem sovled right away.  The busy street on the Zicleta is getting more loud and crazy so the more secluded location (but very close to street) is even more important."
50,"We stayed for 2 weeks here. Manuela and Rene are the perfect hosts. It truly is an oasis from the busy area of Playa Zicatella. Very quiet and they don't tolerate any loud noises, loud music or anything that would make your stay intolerable. The club's at night could get a little loud but it didn't bother us at all. The rooms have AC but with the cool breeze coming in at night we never turned it on once. Rooms are excellent with plenty of space for the 2 of us. There are only 8 rooms available so you get to know your neighbors well if you choose and you can meet people from all over the world. We will definitely stay again here as there are plenty of things to do with nice beaches and excellent restaurants close by."
40,"Название говорит само за себя. Швейцарское качество в Пуэрто Эскондидо. В номерах продумана каждую мелочь, очень удобный свет, что редкость для гостиниц бюджетного уровня в Мексике. Идеально ухоженная территория. Удобное месторасположение.  Nicely furnished rooms, everything thought through. Good bedding, nice furnishings, hooks where you need them, incredibly thought through lighting - better in fact than what I had at the Marriott in Cancun. Very impressive for a budget hotel. The garden is very well tended.  The only negative for me was poor internet."
50,"We spent three nights here. Location is great. Our room was clean, comfortable, and attractive. The grounds are beautifully landscaped. Love that pool! The owners and staff are all lovely people and were helpful in offering their local knowledge."
50,"We spent two days in Puerto Escondido sandwiched in a trip to Oaxaca. The hotel is very conveniently located, with a laid-back feel that rubs off on the guests. My wife wrenched her knee when caught in cross-currents on the beach (the force of the water there is not something to take lightly!) and both Manuela the owner, and several guests, were very kind and helpful. While there is no AC, the ceiling fan was fine for us. Well priced for the location and facilities."
50,"Spotless, excellent location, a perfect little shared kitchen area, fans in the rooms kept us cool at night.  And the size???  Totally suited us.  With only 8 rooms we got to know the other guests meeting up throughout the day to share stories and ideas about what to do.  Loved it!"
50,"I spent 3 nights at the Hotelito Swiss this January and I have to say the place exceeded my expectations. I found what I was looking for in terms of  serenity, simplicity, near proximity to the beach and general pleasantness, but the excellent hospitality was a lovely surprise. Manuela, one of the owners, was not only readily available to answer all of my questions, but was also a great conversationalist and a considerate host. She held up my luggage for me after check out and even offered me a place to shower after I had returned all flustered and sweaty from an extended walk in the heat all day, something I desperately needed before heading to the airport for a 24 hour long journey back home. The Hotelito was recommended to me by a fellow traveler and I would recommend it to"
50,"Stayed six nights after Christmas. Very clean and well managed. Helpfull owner. Great swimming pool! Seemed popular with Europeans..We  had a ground floor room, which was a big help with infirmaties. Four cats - some were friendly. No TV (Not missed!) but also no air conditioning - missed in the early part of the night."
50,"The Holtelita Swiss Oasis is a lovely little hotel within steps of gorgeous surfing beaches, restaurants and small tiendas (that are able to supply any necessities).  We stayed for 10 relaxing days and enjoyed the room, the pool, and the terrace.  The owners, Manuela and Rene, had helpful suggestions."
50,"We had heard such great things about Gecko Rock Resort so we got grandma and grandpa to watch the kiddos and away we went. I have never had such a relaxing vacation - private, gorgeous location. We had the opportunity to travel into town and take other day journeys but really we just wanted to stay at the resort and enjoy its beauty and its SPECTACULAR hand crafted meals. All of this for only $199 a night?! We will be back!!"
40,"Hotelito Swiss Oasis is small hotel just off the main surfing beach in Puerto Escondido. It's a bit of a walk, or a short taxi ride, out of the main town but you have everything you need in terms of shops, bars and restaurants nearby. The hotel itself has a pleasant outside area with a nice pool, which is perfect as the nearby beach isn't safe for swimming (only surfing). The room is simple but comfortable. Our room had a ceiling fan, which helped with the temperatures at night as there's no air conditioning and it does get warm in Puerto Escondido. The hotel doesn't serve any food, but there's a useful little kitchenette where you could prepare basic meals. There's also a fridge of beers and soft drinks, which operates an honesty box system - very welcome for relaxing by the"
50,"We spent a week at Gecko Rock after my brother-in-law found it mentioned on Reddit. It was a great find. The resort is a short walk to a beautiful beach (we were often the only people there), the pool was refreshing, the food was *excellent*, the rooms were spacious, and Mike and Aileen were so hospitable.   The weather was consistently awesome so we spent most of our time at the beach playing in the waves, reading around the pool, napping, playing games, and eating Aileen's delicious meals. We also went into town a couple of times -- once to power paraglide and once to go on a dolphin-watching boat ride.   There was definitely stuff to do if we wanted to, but it was so nice to just relax and not worry about anything. We would certainly recommend Gecko Rock to anyone looking for"
50,"We spent a week at Gecko Rock to celebrate a birthday and to ""get away"" from it all. Mike and Ailene are the perfect hosts and made sure all our needs were met. Margaritas, excellent food, comfortable rooms, nice pool. The beach was picture perfect and we were the only ones on it! A great getaway..............Thanks Gecko Rock!"
50,"I kept feeling like I was in an advertisement for paradise here in this boutique Mexican get-away.  Being waited on hand and foot by Mike (great marguritas!) and fed THE BEST food three times a day by Ailene was divine.  The beach went on forever, golden sand, not a soul on it but us!!  Mike would organize anything that suited us:  surfing, boating, swimming with dolphins....  This is the perfect private get-away.  Highly recommend it!!!"
50,"Simply put, I was scared to visit Mexico, this coming from me a South African citizen. But all I can say is that it was an unbelievable experience, mostly due to the hospitality of the people at Gecko Rock resort. Secluded from the hustle and bustle of the rest of Mexico, Gecko Rock and the surrounding areas are truly a special place. Open beaches, no car alarms and plenty of sun were all we wanted and that’s what we got. Gecko Rock was affordable, the people are pleasant and the scenery is exquisite. I highly recommend taking your partner to this slice of paradise, or make it a group getaway, the option is available."
50,"After several months of stress at work and too many dreary days in Seattle, I was in need of a little break and a lot of sun. Gecko Rock Resort did not disappoint! The location was breathtaking and peaceful, the food amazing, and Aileen and Mike were the best: attentive, friendly, and helpful. I sure am missing the hammock, the Kubb, the food, and the gorgeous pool. My boyfriend and I have only been back home a few weeks and we are already trying to figure out when we can go back!"
50,"My girlfriend and I just came back from a week at Gecko Rock- feeling very relaxed! The resort is located in the small town of Santa Elena, in between the slightly larger towns of Puerto Escondido and Huatulco. The resort is very clean and modern, and the beaches are pristine and beautiful!  Mike and Aileen are very gracious hosts who have created a great product for those looking to get away from it all and relax. On vacations I usually hop city to city, with my nose in a guidebook. This is the first vacation I've been on where I was in the pool with my nose in a book most of the time.  Definitely take time to learn and play Kubb; it's a fun and highly addictive variant of bocce ball.  The food here is absolutely superb. We ate breakfast lunch and dinner here every day, each"
50,"Very Peaceful location with nothing to do but savor Aileen's food and Mike's hospitality.  These two aim to please!  My husband and I, in our 60's, wanted a place to get away from it all and spent 5 nights with Mike and Aileen.  The first day I had 3 naps!  We are vegans and Aileen made the most incredible food for us..all with such fresh vegetables/fruits, hand made moleta's, a mexican dish, desserts and aqua fresco's.  3 times a day!  Smoothies and fresh fruit juices hand made were included as well.  We were in heaven.  Take a walk early morning to see birds if you are a bird lover.  Mike and Aileen will get you anything you want and make you feel at home.  The views of the ocean from the roof are nice especially at sunset.  We walked to the beach each day and enjoyed a long"
50,"Gecko Rock is a great place to come to escape from it all and find some peace and quiet.  The rooms are all handsomely appointed with comfy king-size beds, beautifully hand-tiled (by owner, Aileen) bathrooms and relaxing roof decks with beach chairs and cotton hammocks.  The pool deck and palapa are also wonderfully warm and inviting.  Down by the water, a short walk along a path adjacent to the property, the beach is virtually deserted.  You may see a few people fishing if you head toward the small Mexican town of Agua Blanca where there is a surf hotel and some local restaurants, but otherwise you have the pristine sand completely to yourself.  It almost feels like you have stumbled upon some secret slice of paradise that no one else has yet discovered.  Mike and Aileen are"
50,"Although Cliché, this phrase comes to mind again and again, even though I’ve been back at work for 2 weeks.  My partner and I spent 5 nights at Gecko Rock in December and found that it lived up to previous reviews and certainly exceeded our expectations.  The room was clean and comfortable, the view from the rooftop deck was nothing short of amazing, and every meal was delicious. As others have mentioned, the resort is somewhat secluded down a long dirt road about 30 minutes south of Puerto Escondido.  Since we did not rent a car, we were a bit concerned that we’d have enough to do for our stay.  Turns out we had nothing to worry about.  A taxi into Puerto was inexpensive and easy to get.  We also took ½ day hikes up and down the beach.  The town of Agua Blanca is about a 15"
50,"One year has passed now since I have stayed at the Hotel Ines and I totally miss it. I arrived by plane from ciudad and was about to start my 2 month journey through mexico. Initially intending to stay for 3 nights only I quickly decided to stay for a few days longer as the owners made my stay as close to perfect as it could get. The hotel was perfectly situated at the Zicatela and the owners were always as helpful as possible. They organized trips to nearby places and even took me around to show me things, as the market or towns in driving distance. The prediction of the owner that I will return turned out to be true as well, as I couldn't forget Puerto and managed to round off my trips with another three days of Puerto Escondido. Both rooms I have stayed at were nice and"
30,"We stayed at the Beach Hotel Ines for 3 nights in early Feb ($50).  The hotel is located across the street from Zicatela Beach (200 m from the N end), a good location on a quiet street with nearby restaurants and an easy walk into Puerto Escondido.  The hotel consists of 3 main buildings arranged in a horseshoe around a nice pool, with a restaurant/bar at the top end and another building and some cottages in the back.  A driveway circles between the buildings and the pool, which is unfortunate because it restricts the space along the sides of the pool (there are a number of hammocks and loungers at the street end but they are shaded by the palm trees) and results in cars parked beside and, in some cases, in front of the rooms, spoiling the ambiance when sitting at your"
50,"I wasn't sure what to expect when we arrived for our week holiday at hotel Ines, but I was very impressed with all aspects of this hotel. I cannot rave on enough about the location, it's exactly where you want to be, in the centre of Zicatela beach which is full of bars, restaurants and markets. Ines (owner of the hotel) spoke good English and was very helpful. Our rooms were cleaned daily, our beds were comfortable and the pool was clean and relaxing. I would definitely stay here again if I get back to puerto and I hope to get back there one day :)"
40,"Stayed here for 6 Nights over Christmas in two rooms with six friends.  Beach Hotel Ines is in the best location on Playa Zicatela, Easy walk to all the bars and restaurants.   The rooms were big and we had great beach views from our balconies. Room 304 had two doubles and was ocean facing, Room 300 had two doubles, a single and a day bed with side facing ocean views.  The hotel was very clean and had a quirky charm about it with all the bright colours. The pool area was great with lots of lounges, cushions and a big day bed.  All the staff were very accommodating and a pleasure to deal with.  I definitely recommend the property if you are wanting to stay in the heart of Playa Zicatela."
50,"As a solo traveler, I was at Hotel Ines for 10 nights at the end of October, still low season.  Nathallie accommodated me with a good price (500 pesos/night) in a room with a kitchenette as I requested.  My room was like a small apartment.    The hotel is right in the center of everything in Zicatela.  Good surf break right across the street, restaurant, boutiques, bars...  My room in Building D was great as it was further on the site and quieter than directly on the street, windows on both sides for a good breeze at night and the sheet and towels were changed everyday.    There was 2 morning were I was woken up at 8 by employees doing some reno, but except that, no problem sleeping.  Be also ready to be bugged by sellers coming on the hotel ground to sell you hamaca, jewelry,"
50,"we stayed at hotel Ines for about 10 nights, hotel Ines is the best ypu can find ( trust me... we looked for others) at the best location. the hotel is centerd in the main street, the rooms are very cleen, with A/C , TV ... the resturant is graet, try the fillte mingion!!!  thay have all kind's of rooms, so if you are on a badjet, thay can offer severl options.  it was our honey moon and it was perfect."
50,"I love this place. The location is amazing, directly across the road from the magnificent beach with is amazing waves and beautiful sunsets. The room was perfect for what I needed, comfy bed, wifi, hot shower and the price was right! I appreciated that they had a room and a price for single travellers. The pool area is a great place to hang out, relax and meet people. The restaurant serves good food but there are also so many great restaurants outside your door. The owner of the property is also very helpful. I've been here twice now and I will definitely be back."
50,"Had a great time staying at Hotel Ines, spent a lot of time diving with the in house dive company ""Deep Blue Dive"". The hospitality here was second to none, service with a smile and very active environment on Zicatela. Couldn't go passed a better place!"
40,"Mad lil spot right near all the action. Scroll to bottom for story about how I was getting barreled regularly. Rooms clean, staff pretty helpful, great location. Anyway yeah was just going out for a surf across the roads and getting mad barrels all day just like pull in and wapowwwww* suddenly got a roof of water over your head, totally froth worthy looking up seeing phat slabs of h20 smashing over your head yeweewwwwwwww."
40,"Stayed here for 4 nights. In h bes location in town. Th poms all surround he pool, bar and restaurant which make for good vibes in the afternoon. The rooms were clean and simple. Not too loud either. Within walking distance of bars restaurants like fish tacos yum! The only thing is that it seems like hy need more staff one lunch order of guacamole and pasta took 1;15hr..there was only two other people eating. I think because there under staffed they get a bit rude. Also when we checked out we had to wait 2hr for our bus so to store our luggage it would cost us 60 pesos. Tightasses. Anyway good stay all up!!"
50,"A wonderful atmosphere for your soul. The people are immediate friends upon meeting. Two weeks of yoga, massages, water gym, great meals, and experiencing the local flavors were unforgettable. Will is the kindest and most supporting of hosts. You will leave your new extended family only to plan your return."
10,"DANGER!!!!! Not to be recommended, the night watchman tried to get into our room of pure women and the hotel defended him. On our first night, at approximately 5:30am, a man of about 30 years old opened the window of one of the rooms (the window faces a terrace next to a hallway, it is very large and is barely a meter above the floor level) when the sound of the curtain awakened me, I managed to see the man stealthily opening the curtain, stopping me instantly and when I confronted him accusing him of calling the police, When I turned around to try to turn on the light, the man ran away without explanation. We dialed the number provided by the hotel but no one answered, it went straight to voicemail. The next morning my friends (4 young women) and I went down to the front desk"
30,"We spent 6 nights at this resort and in the end really found it just average Overall the rooms were very dingy….grayish sheets, dirty tile in the bathroom, walls had dirty marks on them. The couch in the living area was unsuitable to sit on. We did have a nice balcony were we spent all our time. We did have air conditioning but not in the bedroom which was strange….they did provide large fans… The location however was fabulous! Just minutes to the beach and great restaurants right around the corner. They even had beach chairs for us to borrow which was awesome!  The daily yoga was free….loved that! The pool and surrounding gardens were well kept. The staff was very friendly and overall we were just very disappointed with our room."
40,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Casamar for 2 entire weeks. The location is simply perfect - centrally located in La Punta (Puerto Escondido), area which I really loved. Casamar is nearby main markets, little stores, shops, restaurants and the beach.   During our stay, I had to work and study remotely and I did not find any difficulties with that either. The connection in the aerea isn’t the best in general, but as said, I did not have any problem working. The wifi speed would average around 10mbps - just sometimes a little slower in the evening when everyone is connected but we were always able to watch movies so it worked great anyways 😊  You can also have your laundries made, participate in free yoga classes, have breakfast at the little restaurant with pool-view, chilling on"
50,"Casamar Suites was a great hotel, really nice layout and staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Free daily Yoga classes were also a nice bonus. The hotel had a lot of activities that you could book through reception such as surf classes and various tours. The price offered through the hotel tended to be better value than if we had organized ourselves. Hotel was a 1 min walk from Zicatela beach and the location in Puente Zicatela was near some really nice bar and restaurant spaces serving really nice food. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely come back.  Hotel fue muy muy bonita. Tienen classes de yoga gracias y el staff son muy simpatica y util. La locacion es muy buena tambien. Es una oferta muy bien."
50,CasaMar its lovely. It´s got a beautiful environment. You wake up by the sound of the birds you sleep with the sound of the ocean. A magical stay. Everyone in CasaMar made us feel like home.  And all the activities they offer are amazing! 
50,"When we got cancelled last minute at our lodging of choice we were lucky to be able to book at Casamar Suites.  What a great place.  Walking distance to the beach along with restaurants and shopping.  The grounds were great with a nice pool and a restaurant with a fantastic chef.  The staff and owner were the best.  Willis, the owner, has put together a great experience with free yoga and dance classes along with a dinner to welcome all that was top notch!  Trust me, it was not a timeshare presentation.  It was an owner that enjoys his guests and wants to make sure they have a great experience.  We will definitely be back soon!"
10,"We stayed at Casamar Suites for three days in July. The outdoor space is beautiful and nicely landscaped. It was clear that the effort placed in the common grounds did not match the effort placed in the living accommodations: The suite we stayed in was incredibly dirty and some areas had exposed wiring. The walls were stained, areas full of dust, and we even killed a cockroach during our stay (some pictures attached). On top of the dirty room, we did not have hot water for two days. We asked the front desk about the water and one of the women upfront expressed shock and concern. She said she would get it fixed immediately. A day later we learned from a different employee that the hotel had already been aware of the lack of hot water -- in fact, it is because they have a tiny"
50,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Casamar suits. We booked two nights initially and extended or stay here for five nights.  The rooms were clean, comfy with good A/C. Grounds were gated and secure and well maintained. The owner Will was very gracious and the staff polite.  Close proximity to beach and restaurant area of punta zicatela."
50,"-Excellence in customer service -Quiet and nice for solo travel or family  -Room properly conditioned for quality sleep and rest( blackout curtains, AC, mini fridge, balcony) -Amazing view of Playa Zicatela - Clean premises, killer staff! -Hotel is pretty comfortable and modern."
50,"Nice and safe heaven with a nice pool in La Punta; Near the beach, and near the action center of La Punta .I recommend it, the pool is a non chloride one, which is fantastic...I highly recommand this Hotel!                                     "
30,"I would say that this is the two nicest hotels in the La Punta district. So whats unbelievable you are steps literally from everything in La Punta. Bars, Restaurants. So what they have going for them is the location.   The hotel is decent sort of a 3 star hotel any where else in the world. They have a great hammock on the porches which is very relaxing. But the chairs they put some cheap varnish, so after the trip I realized all my shirts on the back were stained with pain from the chairs. Made me very upset to ruin so many t shirts.   The cleaning s done very well. The employees are very simple and all have a very good approach. They are good people.   Before I arrived they sent me at-least 10 different messages about the payments, transport as I never have been so bothered so"
50,"Really enjoyed our stay at hotel Punta Zicatela. The location was absolutely perfect. Near enough to the action of the slightly hippier/more backpack (in a good way!) vibe of the la Punta area vs the busier area further up the beach but far enough away from some of the noisier bars/daytime activity to feel really peaceful. The beach itself is beautiful, incredible sunsets and as said, fairly quiet, especially by the hotel here. We had a couples massage on the beach which the hotel organised for us and was so relaxing and great value (650 MX for over an hour for mine!)   Loads of lovely places nearby for breakfast, lunches/snacks and drinks.  Amazing service, such kind helpful staff. Beautiful area of beach with comfy loungers and loads available. The hotel was peaceful and quiet"
50,"This hotel was a great way to take in everything that Punta Zicatela south of Puerto Escondido has to offer.  The rhythmic crashing of the waves, beautiful beach sunsets, hours of beach walking, people watching to the South, a private beach, and wonderful service above and beyond the call of duty.  The best units are those facing the water.  Like a honeymoon for my wife and I."
50,"I came down for a week and ended up staying for more than a month.   The staff here is insanely attentive, so nice, and work really hard to make sure your experience is amazing.   The rooftop is one of the tallest structures in La Punta so makes the bar a perfect place to watch the insane sunsets.   The ladies at the front desk are incredible and can help you with cabs, changing money (they do it there for a lower exchange), and restaurant or adventure recommendations.   The only drawback is they don't have a kitchen so other than some small snacks you will have to go elsewhere.   Wifi was often in and out but if they locked those two things in it would be a must stay at."
50,"Stayed here on a surfing trip in February 2020 for two weeks. The last time I was in La Punta this place was still under construction and I was looking forward to seeing a new hotel on the beach here. The staff are very good and speak good English. It is very close to the good restaurants in La Punta which are only a short stroll away. It's only a short 50 peso cab ride into town or into Zicatela, the main beach area. The pool and beach area have loungers to relax in as well as the roof top bar. The hotel is clean and well kept. The rooms all feature a terrace or balcony with a table and chairs as well as a hammock which I loved. Rooms have AC and a ceiling fan."
40,"Just got home from 10 nights here in Feb of 2020.  We had a king suite on the 4th floor in the building furthest from the beach. There are two towers.  Check in was fast and easy.  There are no elevators, so it was nice that a staff member helped us with our bags up to the room.  Room was excellent.  Always kept spotlessly clean, really good air conditioning, ceiling fan, refrigerator, smart TV which could be used for Netflix or YouTube, and really fast internet.  Bed was on the firm side but comfortable.  There is a digital coded safe in the room and lots of storage for clothes and bags.  Balcony was really a good size and had two nice wooden chairs with cushions and an awesome hammock.  We enjoyed a wonderful sunset view from our balcony.  Pool area was nice but there are not"
50,"I looked for a lot of places to be in La Punta (punta zicatela) and no where else seemed The kind of place I was looking for. That said, before a came I read a review about the place being renovated. I send an email asking about that and they said it would be done by the time we arrive. But we got there and the work was running late... the staff was super polite offering our money back if we decided to leave. We decided to stay. The noise during the day was bad and the pool almost couldn’t be used... but the location (basically at the beach) with a balcony facing the sunset in the sea got us! Afterwards they offered us a discount (witch I thought was fair). So my overall experience was great! The staff is super helpful, very nice, english speakers. They helped us with"
50,"Punta Zicatela Hotel exceeded our expectation. The rooms are very clean and have everything you need. The balcony is beautiful and the view is to die for. Nothing was overlooked. We were on an anniversary trip while staying there and the hotel surprised us with flowers and wine waiting on us when we arrived. There is no elevator, but the staff happily helped carry bags to our room. We speak very little Spanish so we really appreciated that there were plenty of staff members who spoke perfect English and were more than happy to help arrange tours and massages for us. The location is great, right on the beach. If you surf, you can walk to La Punta from the hotel. There are also plenty of restaurants and convenience stores within walking distance. There is some construction going"
20,"Really wanted to love this place, but ...  First, the views are incredible. 5 star from balconies. Rooms are large and modernish, clean, and comfortable. Staff is extremely nice. So it all sounds great, right?  Except for:  Construction starts at 8:00 AM and ends at 6:00 PM (supposedly, but not really) literally 30 feet across from the doors (see pic). You can actually open your door and say ‘hola’ to the guys. And it’s not pidder paddler, but full on heavy pounding, cement saws, the works!  Sunday was off and thought there would be a quiet day, but that’s when it got worse!  The small swimming pool sandwiched between the hotel and building being constructed became became a playground for screaming kids - all day and until pool closed at 9:00 PM.  Screams echoed all the way up"
20,"First: the grounds are gorgeous. The building is clean and well-maintained, and the beach club is very pretty and on an uncrowded beach. Rooms are cramped but pleasant and very clean.  But an ""all-inclusive"" resort should make you feel at ease amongst its abundance. And Posada Real utterly fails at this, introducing scarcity to make routine tasks stressful.  The food: it's Ok quality. I'm not picky but it's tasty and appropriately Mexican. The drinks taste good. But there's a complex schedule of what food and drinks are available where, and we had a way of always finding ourselves in the wrong place for what we wanted, and in some cases with no food at all. For example, at 5:30pm no food can be had at the beach club!  There are three bars at the hotel but at most one is open at"
20,"First I want to say we did have an enjoyable time here except for one thing, mask overkill. In an open air lobby area they were requiring face masks, in the beach club to walk in in the open air area, mask required. It is well past time to do away with these especially in the heat and humidity there and this is the only reason for my 2 star review which would have otherwise been a 5. Am planning on another trip to PE but if this hotel is still mask required everywhere will not be staying there again."
10,"Just to enter the beach club you have to disburse 1000 pesos for each adult or either 850 pesos for any sixth year or older than that.  There is no waiter service, you have to get up and go to the bar to order, neither food service around the pool or beach area., be prepared to walk a lot! They serve no can drinks, neither any kink of fruit drink! You can get agua de sandia, de melon or any other kind of fruit at the club next door ( Villasol), but not here… noting fresh here! Calling my margarita a “margarita” was really an insult! Undrinkable! Wants to eat?  You need to go to restaurant between 2pm and 6pm for buffet. Other than that they only serve snacks and … you need to walk, there is no waiter table service.  Everything from soda to juice is served from 2 liter soda jugs,"
30,"We’ve been coming to the hotel for many years, this time felt different. The food wasn’t great on any day - bland, repetitive and lacked any real thought. I wonder if the Head Chef has left, we all noticed the taste and Food ideas were not up to the normal standard.   In terms of snacks, we ordered a hot dog at 4:30 and by 5:10 nothing had arrived despite we asking both waiters. In the end, Franciso fixed the issue.   Overall not a great or bad experience just ok."
50,"Posada Real Puerto Escondido was a good choice during our stay on the Oaxacan coast. The hotel is well situated in the quiet neighborhood of Rinconado, a short walk (or a very cheap taxi ride) to the famous Playa Carrizalillo. For the price, the hotel affords you a free delicious breakfast buffet that changes its menu every morning, plus all-you-can-drink beverages day and night (you name it, they have it). The rooms are a nice size, and we got to secure a corner room with a view of the ocean. The rooms are well sanitized and refreshed every day.  The hotel boasts 2 sets of pools: one by the lobby, and one by the beach which is about a 5-7 minute walk down. Beach-side cottages also offer the comfort of lounging next to the waves (although the water may not be recommended for"
50,"We stayed at Posada Real for a long weekend and liked the resort very much.  Our room was clean and comfortable, and the staff was very friendly.  The resort Is located right on the coast and guests have access to Coco’s Beach Club right next door.  It’s a nice place to lounge with drinks on the beach or by the pool.  The resort is also close to town.  It’s just a pleasant 10-15 minute walk.  We would definitely stay here again."
40,"I have just completed my stay at the Posada Real Hotel. Overall the experience is very pleasant. I am vegan so I did text the hotel before my trip to find out about their food options. The daily breakfast buffet has plenty of fruit and a few vegan dishes like beans and cooked veggies. I also requested an early check-in. The general manager granted my request and allowed my all-inclusive package to start as soon as I arrived at 10 am vs usual 2 pm. The general manager came over to greet me even though it was his day off so that was very nice of him. My room type was the one with a terrace and an ocean view. It was a very nice, bright room with everything I needed including a safe (management, please add an in-room safe to the list of amenities available in the room). My room was"
50,"If you’re visiting Puerta Escondido - STAY HERE! The beach here is perfect. The service was amazing, the staff go above and beyond for you! The beach club was also phenomenal. Location is great, not far from other hotspots in the Escondido area. "
10,"The hotel service is atrocious ! Sheets were dirty. Shower mouldy. The walls in the room are so thin that we could not sleep because of the next door client snoring  like a bear. The food is scarse, poor quality, badly cooked. The pools are big but I could see rings of grease on the surface. Nobody speaks a word of English . Shower is hot or cold. I ended up having a cold shower not to be scolded . Good luck then!!!"
30,Had stayed the last two years at posada real Los cabo and decided to try Puerto Escondido based on our love of cabo resort.  Booked in January for our anniversary trip in December only to arrive and find all the pools on coco level closed for renovations.  A little warning ahead of arrival or even at check in would have been nice or even the first morning when we were trying to catch the beach shuttle but no we were left clueless until we walked up to the club level and my husband went wtf.  Otherwise trip was wonderful and buffet staff very friendly but don’t expect drink service. Seemed like such a beautiful place but didn’t live up to the service we experienced at los cabo so will be going back there instead. Sorry I couldn’t write the same glowing reviews for this resort. 
50,"Villa Lili is pure seraphic bliss.  There is a beautiful, seamless play in the vacillation between tradition and innovation. The meals created uniquely for each guest embody and capture the heart of Mexican cuisine in taste while the presentation of even the simplest of dishes evokes the mastery of a talented artist that bequeaths veneration to the beholder, or in this case, the lucky ones able to eat the amazing dishes!    The entire ambience of the Villa invokes this same theme.  From the hundreds of orchids to the swimming pools, to the waking sunrise or the mystical sunset, the deliberate attention catered to each and every guest without pretense, Adelina, Luis, and the entire staff of the Villa deliver above and beyond.  You will not find better people or service in all of"
50,"The service was second to none. Adelina the owner and hostess is extra special. She cares about her guests and goes the extra step to make sure that you are well looked after. 2 weeks prior we had stayed at Adelinas other property ""Quinta Lilli"" 5 minutes away from ""Villa Lilli"". We met up with some friends in San agustinillo an hour south of Puerto Escondido. We were so impressed with Puerto Escondido and Adelina we returned with our friends to villa Lilli to show them. The property is well located. Walking distance to beaches, resturaunts, Centro, and cheap taxis are plentiful. The supplied breakfasts are a real treat Mexican style. The swimming pool at the hotel was very refreshing after coming back from a day in the Puerto Escondido heat. The hotel is kept very clean. Would"
50,"Terrific week at Villa Lili. Host owner Adelina and cooking and cleaning and groundskeeping people are all lovely. Terrific breakfasts. Good firm beds.  Good location...minutes walk from the beach strip with all the beachy needs for Carazalillo.  It really is a very chill, very good place to be.  Very good value for money."
50,"After previously staying in Quinta Lili 3 years ago, we were very excited to be back in Puerto Escondido and to be staying in Adelina's newest hotel. We enjoyed another wonderful stay with amazing hospitality. Adelina and her staff go above and beyond, and make you feel so at home.  It's so nice to wake up to a freshly cooked breakfast, sitting around a dining table with other guests. The rooms are beautiful and the property itself is peaceful and relaxing. We couldn't recommend Villa Lili or Quinta Lili more."
50,"We were fortune to stay four nights at this wonderful hotel. The atmosphere is very laid back with a feeling more like you are staying at a friend's home.  The highlight -- aside from the warm and welcoming owners -- were the amazing and creative breakfast choices all made fresh daily.  From mole to enchiladas verdes to tamales.  It was fabulous.  After leaving we were honored to have been invited back for a special dinner they were preparing that next evening.  We may never be back here, but if you are in the area I hope you are able to experience this amazing place!"
50,"In Puerto Escondido, there are hotels and then there's Villa Lili - a magical oasis staffed with the most amazing people.   First off, location. Villa Lili is so close to Playa Carrizalillo - it's about a ten minute walk. It's also central to other beaches such as Playa Zicatela and Playa Bacocho, so you can mix it up on any given day. Cab rides for each direction are only 30 pesos and takes about 10-15 minutes. Super easy. Villa Lili itself is also a minute walk from the main strip where all the locals dine. Very accessible to great food and a market.   The hotel itself is amazing. Luis must be a genius because everything was well thought out. The pools are awesome and the rooms are EVEN better. Spring a little more for the rooms with the hot tub/whirlpool. Totally worth it."
50,"The villa is simply amazing, our hosts Adelina and her husband were extremely nice and helpful. The breakfast is superb, you will have a local chef that will make you the best typical dishes  (believe me I am mexican and she is truly amazing). They arranged our pick up inbound and outbound to the airport. The beach (Playa Carrizalillo) is 15 minutes away walking and Zicatela is 15 away by cab. Just behind this place you have a boulevard with cafes, bars and restaurants. The rooms were extremely clean and everything was functioning. The rooms at the upper floor have an amazing sunset view."
50,"My partner at the time and I stayed with Adelina in 2010 for 4 nights or so. Adelina was amazing - took time out of her own life to show us around, give us pointers, help us arrange further transport and accommodation etc. 5 out of 5. I would recommend this place to anyone. I really hope to go back. And ADELINA, I hope you are well! Dave"
50,"This property is hands down the best place to stay in Puerto Escondido! We spent three nights here and didn't want to leave! Adelina and her staff are amazing - from check-in to check-out you are well taken care of. The property is small, but there is ample opportunity for privacy as well. The breakfasts were amazing - fresh fruit, granola, yogurt, and a freshly prepared hot option, and the conversation was even better - we felt as though we were with family! In addition, the location is absolutely perfect, as it is right near our favorite beach, Carrizalillo! Thank you for such a wonderful stay, Villa Lili! We will certainly return soon!"
50,What a fantastic place to stay!  I stayed here for 5 nights in March 2015 for some downtime on a 3 month holiday in Central America.  I could not have found a more perfect place.  The whole experience was excellent from the ease of booking and payment with Louis through to the pick up and drop off at the airport.   The property is very clean and well maintained and the daily room services spotless.   All of the staff at Villa Lilli are lovely and take a lot of time to ensure that you have the best holiday possible.  One of my main highlights was the daily traditional breakfast prepared personally for you. I was travelling alone and found the location and property to be safe.  Ade had a lot of recommendations of what to do in both the area and throughout Mexico.  Also they brew
40,"Set in a beautiful jungle-like garden, which allows for nice privacy during the morning cafe hours. There is a lot of love and attention to detail put in by the owner and staff, with artistic touches everywhere. Our room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and we had a beautiful outdoor kitchenette which came in very handy and had almost everything we needed.  The only reason I dont give 5 stars here is because we found it hard to get good sleep. Our room had open-air (screened) windows to allow the cool air in at night (no AC) which was great, but it also meant we could hear any sound happening on the grounds. In particular there are workers watering plants, talking etc at 4AM, and then cafe getting ready to open from like 6:30/7AM on. All totally understandable but we"
50,"Stayed in this charming B & B.  Simple and clean, no frills.  To use the AC is extra because energy costs are high here as the owner explained.  Still a good value and a comfortable stay.    The grounds are lush and beautifully decorated.  Oaxacan owned and operated.   Breakfast there was amazing!"
50,"The exotic plants, flowers, and parrots make Villa Mozart y Macondo an otherworldly, charming place, perfectly located near the Carrizalillo Beach (accessible via a long staircase) and outstanding restaurants (such as Almoraduz and Metxcalli). Angelica will give you VERY good advice on what to do, where to eat, what to see, and I advise you to follow her advice! She's wiser than random review writers here on TripAdvisor."
50,Very charming and cozy place. Safe neighborhood. Close to other eateries. The breakfast at this place are EXCELLENT.  I have been riding my motorcycle in Mexico all this month. My only regret is I didn't find this place sooner. Call Angelica direct. she's the owner. She'll negotiate a better rate than what is offered on this site.
50,"Just loved staying at this small hotel - the ambience and garden is nothing short of stunning. The delightful 'Angie' is an absolutely charming host, & her love of art & plants has created a garden and atmosphere that is truly magical.The hotel is one street away from some excellent restaurants (Blvd Benito Juarez)  and a short 2 min walk down to Carrizalillo beach which is reached by some 100 steps. This is a small bay, safe to swim  with some lovely little beach restaurants and definitely the prettiest beach in PE. Some truly amazing things we did- go out at 7 am with Shaun +52 1 954 110 0562 (whats ap) & his boat the 'Milagros' - we swum with 2000 spinner dolphins which was TRULY AMAZING, and saw humpback whales.  We also went out with bird watcher Ulysses to Lagoona"
50,"As the author of the Moon Travel Guide to Oaxaca, I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite hotels in the whole state. The grounds are beautiful, full of exotic plants, comfy hammocks, and cozy, verdant nooks to relax and read or do a little smooching. The staff are all courteous and attentive, and owner Angélica is extremely nice and accommodating. The food is all healthy and delicious, as well."
50,"What a wonderful charming little hotel! The staff, location, artistically decorated room, quiet garden were all perfect. Plus, it’s less than a 5 minute walk to beautiful Carizzilillo beach. Don’t forget to have a happy hour 2 for 1 mango mezcal cocktail! "
50,"We stayed here for 4 nights. It was very cheap by European standards so we weren't sure what to expect. But we needn't have worried although the room was not luxurious, in fact fairly basic, not much space to hang clothes etc, small shower room. It was very clean, the bed was comfortable and it was very quiet. Situated in a beautiful garden, there is a lovely breakfast area and you could choose whether to take breakfast or not - we had this one day and it was excellent. You pay extra if you want Air Conditioning - we decided to just use the fan and this was fine in November - maybe not in peak summer! Angelica who runs the place was really friendly and helpful and very patient with my faltering Spanish! You are literally 10 minutes walk from a lovely beach and there are many"
50,Once upon a time there were three italian close friends. They were searching for a place to stay near Playa Carrizaillo... VILLA MOZART WAS THE RIGHT PLACE...and Manfred is the BEST! 13 Novembre 2005.
50,"Excellent location, you are behind the main strip of restaurants and a one min walk to the top of the stairs to the beach. The room was lovely and clean. Beds were made each day and new towels provided on the second day. Breakfast is tasty and great value for money. Happy hour is 4-6 each day. The hosts are amazing and ensured we were always comfortable. I highly recommend this place and would 100% stay again. Thank you for making our time in Puerto Escondido wonderful. "
50,"-Warm personal hospitable host, Paul, provides a great introduction (in English!) to the area. -Comfortable rooms designed in modern Mexican style -Great value for money, breakfast included in price -Breakfast: good coffee, large choice, good food -Good location for Zicatela beach, easy to get around by taxi"
50,"This place is a relic in brand-saturated Mexican beach tourism. The hotel is beautifully adorned with arabesque mosaics and cute murals. The room was very spacious and all details were thought of, you could tell. The place was very clean and all set. Paul was very entertaining in conversation and had many interesting stories to tell. Definitely not a miss!"
50,"One of the best place to stay in puerto, quiet, clean, secure, etc.., when i return to puerto, I'll stay again and again. The pesonal of the facilities are the best people, the service are excelent, thanks to PAUL and his crew, good job guys, and remember if u want to rest and enjoy puerto stay in TABACHIN. P.S the best view of Zicatela beach."
50,"Posada Tabachín boasts pretty much everything people look for in a hotel: the spectacular sea views from the terrace and some rooms, peace and quiet, the delightful traditional breakfasts (the best in the area, and I'm Mexican), the very clean, comfortable rooms individually furnished in impeccably good taste (they are such an oasis after you're back from a beach adventure), the one-of-a-kind murals in the common areas...  However, once you stay there, the importance of these normally sought after features of travel accommodation fade in importance, overshadowed by the experience Paul has achieved.  Part of it has to be the deeply stimulating intellectual discussions.   I still will never forget how, my first time there, his friend was showing us an original page of a Gutemberg"
50,"I was fortunate enough to stay at the Tabachin again. I have moved down here for work and spent a few nights in the "" blue room penthouse"" before moving into my apartment. I already miss it and wish I could have stayed forever.  The quality and cleanliness of the rooms is superb and the breakfasts!!! Try the oriental tofu stirfry or the enchiladas banderas! Breakfast timeis a real treat. You can chat with Paul, an absolutely charming person, other people passing through and the locals. Yes, the locals! The breakfasts are so good that people who live here stop in to relish something from the very ample menu.  Speaking of the locals, I've been here long enough to learn that the Tabachin is held in very high regard by both natives and transplants alike. Paul's reputation for"
50,"I just came back from my trip in Oaxaca. I visited different places in Oaxaca, but my stayed at Tabachin studios in Puerto Escondido made my trip even better. Love the style, location and their staff. Very clean place. The owner Mr. Paul is a great person. Very friendly, and honest, also great guy to have a conversation with (bilingual ;)). I will highly recomend this place. Also great food. Nothing to complain about... :)"
30,"What a lovely set of unique rooms, with a charming host! Our room was huge - it had 3 beds and was more affordable than other doubles in the area. As with any charming B&B in a quiet part of Puerto Escondido, be prepared for tradeoffs: being in a quiet street requires walking through a 50+ metre unlit gravel back road to get there. Some of the wood furniture suffered from the effects of being in the tropics and there was lots of wood dust. And the linens were a bit worn. But breakfasts were wonderful, and Paul was so helpful in organising assistance for us. We extended our stay there due to the great location and helpful service."
50,"We had a great time at Tabachin. The breakfast choices and quality were excellent, comfortably restaurant standard. The hotel itself is close enough to both main beaches to mean it's just a leisurely 2 minute stroll to get there, but still far enough away to get a bit of peace and quiet if you wish. The view from our room would have to be one of the best in Puerto Escondido. Excellent service and value for money."
50,"I have visited Puerto Escondido regularly since the 1990s and stayed in more than a dozen of its hotels, until I found El Tabachin, and now I won't stay anywhere else. I could talk about the exquisitely designed luxurious rooms (with English language bookshelves stoked galore with great works), the fact that the best breakfast in Puerto comes free with the room, the two minute walk to Playas Zicatela and Marinero, and the fact that the hotel staff is the most service oriented and prepared in the entire region but it all goes back to one key fact: Paul Cleaver knows how to run a hotel and he is by himself a tourist attraction worth visiting Puerto to experience. His lifetime of stories of traveling, of the arts, of the people he has known, and his long term knowledge of Puerto"
50,"After whole night bus drive we arrived to Tabachin where we were greeted by a charming an talkative owner with flexible attitude. We could check in early in the morning and enjoyed tasty Mexican breakfast.We were amazed by a splendid view from our spacious top-roof studio.The next day we were allowed to leave a luggage in the hotel and after whole day on the beach,we were allowed to take a shower. We strongly recommend this acommodation!"
50,"Its a bit over a year old and very clean place. Well designed and comfortable. Staff is exceptionally friendly. We had the least expensive room but still very functional, bathroom could have been a bit bigger. Palapa on the top is just gorgeous and with nice view of the Puerto Escondido. The eggs for breakfast are vey pricey! Also a bit far to walk to the beaches, but taxis are very cheap."
20,"We have been in Puerto Escondido for over a month and have stayed in several hotels during that time. We were looking forward to our stay at Shavanna Hotel based on the reviews here.  It looks very nice when you first walk in but once you get to the rooms they are not as great as they look in the photos.  For what we paid per night, we are disappointed. Especially due to the noise levels...see below for details.  Here is a breakdown of what is positive and then not so positive.  KITCHEN  Positive -Full fridge that works well -Stove works well Not so Positive We were hoping to cook meals here as it showed as a full kitchen -not enough pots (only two frying pans) -no coffee mugs. Only very small coffee maker (NO COFFEE SUPPLIED) that has a broken carafe.  -no blender -no dish"
50,Value for money is amazing here. Although it's not on the beach. Great staff and great food and coctails on the pool. The rooms are more then amazing and have a new air condition.  Really really recomnded👌 
50,"New hotel, beautiful, cozy, spotless.  The hotel opened in 2015, lobby is beautiful, it has a bar and a pool. Rooms are fine, beds are REALLY COMFORTABLE.  Food is amazing, free drink upon arrival. The ceviche is unbelievable and signature drinks are yummy. The hotel is near the airport and provides free transportation to and from the terminal and also to the beaches and other destinations. What is more impressive it is the warm and efficient service. Warnings: food can take a bit long to be ready as everything in Puerto Escondido. Walls and windows are a bit thin and you can listen to the people in the bar, and in the lobby which can affect your need for quiet. Bathroom amenities are great quality and the upper flor restaurant is really really nice. Although it is not near the"
50,This is one of the best boutique hotels that my wife and I have stayed in.  They picked us up from the airport in a beautiful jeep at no extra charge.  In fact anywhere you want to go in Puerto Escondido they will offer free transportation.  The pool is small but very beautiful and the pool bar offers great cocktails.  All the staff is super friendly and accommodating.  Our last evening the chef prepared an excellent rooftop dinner which we will never forget.  We have found our escape away from Mexico City!!!
50,"We had a wonderful experience here. The most helpful, happy and friendly staff with great levels of customer care. Room was neat, clean and updated! It's a beautiful new hotel that doors everything right. Very comfortable. Will definitely come back!"
50,"This place have all you need to enjoy a lovely vacation time in Puerto Escondido Oaxaca, bring your family and friends and have fun, very nice hotel. The beach is not far and the bar have amazing drinks."
50,"This hotel is truly remarkable. You won't find anything better in this heavenly beach! If you are looking for an inspiring, clean, artistic, affordable, and fun spot, you should absolutely book this one. It has a perfect spot as it is very close to the beach. Ask for Anuar, he'll hook you up! "
50,"This place is awesome !! The beach is very close. The hotel is clean and fancy. The bedrooms are excellent. All the personnel are respectful, helpful and nice. The owners are incredible and always trying to do their best. I definitely recommend it."
10,"This is ultimately a negative review but I would like to say that the owners are very nice. I am putting this review on here so people have some data for their own decision making (we wish we had seen something like this to aid our decision making).  We were booked in for 3 nights, stayed for an hour. The reasons: -no aircon, very hot (July) -we felt the rooms weren’t as depicted -we didn’t know this at the time of check in as we came straight from the airport, but we felt like it is in a dodgy area. When we checked into our hotel on the main strip (El Morro) after leaving this hostel, the area was 100% nicer and felt much safer. I am confused as to the other reviews here that say it is in a good area? It takes just as long in a taxi from El Morro to Playa Manzanillo (really"
50,"We had an amazing stay in Tower Bridge, thanks to the all the staff members working there! The Hostel is the perfect mix between chill out and party and what makes the Hostel really unique is the so called ""wheel"". I don't wanna say to much but if you ever have the chance to crash by, James, one of the staff members here, makes sure you have an incredible night with an awesome bunch of people spinning the party wheel. He really brings people together!"
40,"We loved it at Tower Bridge! The pool is amazing and big, there are tons of places to chill (hammocks, chairs, couches), the workers are great people and loads of fun. There's a spinning wheel that they use to play drinking games which was pretty fun. One side is the less fun, buy-more-drinks side. The other is a bit naughty and way more fun. Only complaint would be the assistant manager (who is also a flat earther, ugh). He just stomps around all day being angry at all the workers for stupid things, and would stand on the sideline while we played drinking games just watching until a girl had to give a kiss to every guy in the circle. Then all the sudden he was in the game and she had to kiss him. Bit creepy. There were a lot of tensions between him and the other workers. Other"
50,"We stayed in this hostel for 4 night in a private room! We absolutely loved it: location is great, close to few beaches(the turtles one, and 2 others) and only on a 15 mins taxi to zicatela beach! We have met very nice people and we have been lucky to have a chat with the owner who gave us some nice tips for our journey! It’s a friendly hostel so good if you are up to make new friends ! Thanks for having us! Tom & Mica "
20,"I stayed in that hostel 2 nights, so everything was bearable for a short amount of time but I would have gone to another hostel if I had to stay longer. First of all the common areas / kitchen / bathrooms were very far from being clean and very impractical. Which is a shame because when you’re already staying in a hostel dorm you know you won’t have a lot of comfort, so not being able to have basic cleanness was really a negative point for me.  Second, the hostel is said to be a “party hostel”. I’m fine with that. But when “partying” is actually synonym for SOME members of the staff (not all of them, some others were absolutely lovely) to trying to get the girls do the “sexy stuff” written on a wheel of fortune, in order to satisfy their small fantasies, I’m not fine with that"
50,"If you're looking to make friends, be sure to go to Towerbridge. Really good vibes in this hostel, always people who are up for a drink or grab a bite. The owner of the hostel, Erik, is such a nice person. He will help you with everything you need. The location is really good. Go to coral beach if you want a beach all to yourself!"
50,"Wanted to stay for 2 nights - finally stayed for 4. This tells it all. Loved the atmosphere, the people and the surrounding. The staff is very friendly and the hostel clean and the pool just a dream. 20 minutes walk to the beautiful beach and tours right from the hostel. Cheap and nice breakfast at the hostel (great after a long night out). Great cocktails and music at the bar. Would definitely come back."
40,"Nice cute hostel, clean and great place to relax after a busy week for day of dead in oaxaca. Easy to get cabs to beach cheap at 40pesos. Beaches are beautiful. Big rooms but plenty of showers. Good food places nearby too! "
50,"I had an amazing stay in this hostel ! Staff (both national and international) are amazing, they create a wonderful atmosphere, feeling like a bunch of friends hanging out during the day, have awesome parties at night! And the facilities are great, pool, pool table, hammocks, a lot of showers, kitchen fully equipped: what does a traveler wants more?! I would it recommend it to every body passing Puerto escondido!"
50,"Absolutely love this hostel! Staff very helpful and organise nights out for everyone. Very chill vibe and everyone is really friendly- 100% recommend if you want a hostel that's social! Plus, the bar is pretty awesome. Eric the barman makes some pretty great drinks. "
20,"This is a great place for younger travelers into the surfing scene.  The hotel is certainly minimalist, both in terms of accommodations and service.  We booked a double room expecting two beds, rather than a bed and fold out sofa. "
50,"Hotel Aqua Luna is definately the best hotel I've stayed at in Puerto Escondido. We spent 6 weeks there and had a ball. The rooms are spacious modern and spotless. The atmosphere is fantastic. Just relaxing by the pool or having a few beers and a game of pool under the palapa. Its close to the beach and  has ocean views so you can check the surf from the balcony and if its cranking, which it often is, you can be out in the line up in 5 minutes . Clive and Adriana, the proprietors, and Corel looked after us like kings and are great fun people. Clive is Austalian and Adriana is Mexican so both english and spanish are spoken fluently.  I highly recomend Hotel Aqua Luna. "
50,"i had the absolut pleasure of staying at the aqua luna for 2 weeks in august. i just want to say that this has to be , hands down , THE best place in puerto escondido. the pool was sparkling and cool , the bar was always stocked with ice cold beer and the pool table was an added bonus too , not to mention the big screen tv. clive and adriana are the hosts here and you couldnt ask for more helpful and kind people , i had an amazing time here , thanks to clive , adriana and the friendly staff. "
50,"The Aqua Luna at Puerto Escondido was excellent. I had the pleasure to stay at the Aqua Luna for approximately 8 nights in August 2006. Our stay with friendly hosts Adriana and Clive made us feel very relaxed and at home in the newly finished Aqua Luna. Both hosts speak excellent english and spanish and have great local knowledge of the area. The place boasts of excellent faclilities such as the pool, large screen TV, poolside bar and pool table which is very hard to find in Puerto. The rooms are always maintained in an immaculate state by friendly staff who are more than happy to assist you with any requests you have. Overall I would have to stay the Aqua Luna is the best place to stay at Puerto with excellent facilities, accomodating hosts whilst maintaining a friendly"
50,"Quinta Lili is welcoming, clean, cosy and quiet. Convenient for the strip of cafes/restaurants/shops in La Rinconada and a couple of beautiful nearby beaches, or just lounging around in tranquil surroundings. At the quiet end of Puerto Escondido, away from the surf beaches. Good breakfasts included and local craft beers in the fridge for sale. We were travelling as a family with two 7-yr-olds, and they loved hanging around the pool and, even more, a trip to release baby golfina turtles into the sea (suggested and organised by our host, Ade)."
50,"The quaint b&b style accommodation lived up to our expectations!  As per previous reviews, the hospitality of the hostess and staff (Ade, Magda and Fransisco) was genuine.  Close walk to some of the best restaurants we have eaten at in Mexico.  And the breakfasts were absolutely delicious.  Location was quiet, and taxi service readily available and affordable.  If we are ever back in the area, we will definitely stay here again."
50,"The rooms, the service, the breakfast and most of all the very wonderful hospitality offered by Ade and Magda are amazing.  This is a wonderful place to stay. The rooms are clean and thoughtful. While there is no a/c the fans and windows as placed well to provide a breeze."
50,"Quinta Lili is a fantastic place to stay in Puerto Escondido and its hosts are really nice, welcoming people.    The Positives: 1.  The ground and vibes are very tranquil - it is easy to relax here. 2.  Rooms and balconies are large - a bit uniquely fitted out.  Ours had a kitch spa in it! 3.  Breakfast - fantastic!  There is European yoghurt and fruit but also a freshly made to order Mexican dish prepared for breakfast.  Some fine food indeed! 4.  Location is good.  Note - this is a 500m walk to the beach and is not ""right on the beach"" 5.  Upper level rooms can get ocean views.  The Negatives There really are not too many negatives.  If you are seeking luxury or ""trendy"" - this is not in that category, but it is great value and has some fantastic attributes."
50,"I was recommended to stay at this place by a friend who raved about the friendly hosts, quiet location and quality amenities. Naturally skeptical, I was a little doubtful it could live up to this hype.   The great thing is that it lived up to all expectations and more. Aeia and Magdalana are incredibly fun, caring and generous hosts that really want to make your visit to Mexico and PE whatever you want. They whip up a great mexican breakfast and most impressively a seriously good craft beer!   The combination of the engaging style of the hosts, quality accomodation, the communal breakfast sessions and the quieter location means you can get to know other guests. My experience was the same as my friends, meeting some really interesting people.  Will be back for sure!"
50,"This place is just amazing, it's confortable and the people are really kind. Really well located, at 5mn walking from the beach and a place with restaurants just behind. We were there in low season and we literally had the house for us. It was really perfect. I'll come back soon."
50,"We had an amazing time at Quinta Lili! Adelina and Magdalena were incredible hosts. Fantastic rooms, great breakfasts, perfect location. Beautiful beach a 5 minute walk away and great restaurants just around the corner. Can't wait to come back!"
50,"I am about to leave Quinta Lilli for the airport and am sitting here reflecting on the amazing and relazxing week that we had here this week in Puerto Escondido. I have not been to Puerto Excondido in 15 years but was happy to find that it still has that same chill vibe that i experienced 15 years ago. This so very much includes Quinta Lilli where we stayed in the Master Suite for the past week. While the room is an open air room with screens and fans they also provide tower style fan/air conditioners that keep you nice and cool even during the hottest part of the day. If that is not enough for you, there is the private jaccuzzi on the back patio of the room where you can watch the sunset and enjoy a bottle of wine from the well stocked honor bar downstairs. Quinta Lilli also"
50,"Best location in Puerto Escondido!  Everything was clean, the rooms are really nice. Very warm hearted and helpful owner! Very good breakfast! Even for mi they did an extra menu, because I can' t eat dairy products. Perfect!!! We'll be back!!!"
50,"This is a fantastic hotel!!! So tranquil and beautiful. We were so pleasantly surprised to not only be able to check in early, but have breakfast served before we stayed a night!!! Plus they took care of the taxi service. Unreal.  Coming back every year.  Lisa and Chase"
50,"We're back after 9 months to stay at the wonderful Flor de Maria.  6 of us journeyed from Acapulco to Puerto Escondido.  On arrival we all headed upstairs to the roof bar for some cold beer and to enjoy the beautiful view of the Pacific. This year we lazed around in the shade swinging on the hammocks with beer in hand (La Buena Vida).  The dinner and breakfast menu are fantastic and selection is excellent. Joanne does a great job of keeping us healthy.  We stayed on the second floor for 3 nights. Each room has a safe for your passports etc., and a fan to keep the room at the right temperature.  We enjoy the shopping in Puerto Escondido. Some of our favorite stores are: the loom factory, beautiful bedspreads,excellent prices, main market lots to see.  Paul can always give you"
40,"Nice hotel in good location. Clean rooms, good value for money. Hotel beautifully decorated and painted. Rooftop pool and terrace has great views. Manager away during our stay but staff friendly and helpful (limited English so bring a little Spanish with you)."
50,"We enjoyed 5 nights in Hotel Flor de Maria in Puerto Escondido! The food they serve is excellent and very reasonably priced, so it was no wonder the restaurant was filled almost every evening we were there. The rooms are also comfortable with soft beds (not many of those in Mexico!) and were kept very clean by the friendly people working there. The roof terrace with a bar, pool and hammocks were also very nice to relax on, and it had a great view over the beach, which is just a minute walk away. This is also the part of the beach where it is safe to swim, and not the big Zicatela beach where it is huge waves for the surfers.   The location is perfect for enjoying Puerto Escondido, as it is close to the beach restaurants and the main street, without being bothered by noise of any"
50,"Just back from Puerto Escondido and the Flor de Maria was perfect, as always. Puerto's a great spot but staying at the Flor is what makes it irresistible, which is why so many of us return year after year after year to savor Joanne's fine food, catch up on the news of staff and other guests and bask in the comfort of Paul and Joanne's unfailing warmth and hospitality, to say nothing of the hammocks by the pool. Book often, book soon. MLF from Toronto."
50,"I just love the pastel colors of this hotel. It makes you so comfortable walking through this Crayola Castle. The rooftop is another favorit haunt of mine. And lets talk about the diningroom and the specails of the day. Always a good mixture to satisfy ones tastes. The way Joanne can fuse flavors with the local fare is incredible. One day I had Tandoori Mahi Mahi. FANTAZMAGORICAL. I love my chilirellenos and I was told by her that she does not deepfry them Like everybody else. She bakes hers. If you need anything at all, Paul and Joanne will make sure you get it. I look forward to my return back to my hidden cove."
50,"What a charming hotel, perfect location and warm hosts.  We kept Paul and Joanne busy with requests, all of which they tended to graciously.  The hotel is not ""on the beach"" but is a very short walk (and the hotels ""on the beach"" are actually across a street from it).  Beautiful ocean view from the rooftop patio, great food in the restaurant.  Really glad we chose this one."
50,"Like so many others my wife and I were truly happy with our choice of the Flor de Maria. We stayed there for a week but others in the hotel were there literally for months. Although it seems a bit odd to stay that long in a hotel it does show you how comfortable and pleasant the place is. Paul and Joanne are natural hoteliers and restauranteurs - they like people, they are effortless helpful and they run a fine establishment. It is, however, a quiet place that caters to a mature crowd. No lively late night bar but that's not very far away if you want one. Their roof top terrace/bar with view of the ocean (and small pool) is a perfect place for the hottest part of the day and the restaurant claimed our custom for roughly half the time basically on the strength of Joanne's"
50,"Flor de Maria  is close to everything but still quiet and quaint. Beautiful and romantic colonial style building with inner courtyard. Perfectly located halfway between the two restaurant strips (a five minute walk to each) and almost on the beach (a 30 second walk). Full bar and restaurant service. A super nice rooftop terrace, half shaded, half open, with pool and bar and a spectacular view of the Pacific. Sitting there reading during the afternoon was a great pleasure. Rooms were spacious with lots of shelf space for two people to spread out our stuff. Add warm personal attention from owners Paul and Joanne and reasonable prices and you can hardly ask for anything more. Wait, there was free unlimited purified water available on each floor. A detail, but very convenient."
50,"Wow, what a great hotel!!!  The owners, Paul and Joanne see to your every need.  They treat everyone like family.  Five of us traveled from Acapulco to Puerto Escondido on a recommendation of a good friend, Rik. We stayed at Flor de Maria a very cute, colonial hotel for 4 days. The rooms were comfortable, clean and spacious each with their own safe.  The roof top bar had an excellent view of the bay with a gentle breeze and dipping pool.  Sandwiches were available there for lunch.  The hotel is a short stroll to the beach, ""Playa Principal"", a safe swimming bay.  The morning breakfast and evening meals were cooked to perfection. Paul and Joanne arranged a wonderful lagoon and bird watching tour and a great city tour with an English speaking guide.  The hotel is very quaint and"
50,"You will not be disappointed with this small gem of a hotel, in fact, you will not want to leave. It's just a short walk down a cobble-stone street to the Marinero Beach and close to the main road where plenty of taxis, collectivos and busses will take you anywhere you wish to go. There is a rooftop verandah with a small pool, bar, and shaded hammock area. It would be easy to spend the entire day there but the sunsets over the sea must not be missed. The rooms are simple and spacious and are quiet at night. They have an overhead fan but no AC, which isn't required. The small restaurant is also excellent. Perhaps the best part of this place are the owners, Paul and Joanne who lovingly care for their guests and employees as if they were family."
50,"We arrived on December 21, 2018. We find a lot of curious details in its architecture that are, according to the manager and son of the owner ""products of the culture of imagination"", for the enthusiastic and observant visitor, it will not be difficult to notice an orchestra welcoming the rooms. The place is bathed in sunshine and the rooms on the third floor have a beautiful view. In our room, Suite 1 on the third floor, we found cleanliness, enough space, a large and comfortable bed, a bathroom in excellent condition with everything needed to refresh us. In addition, we had access to a small well equipped kitchen with coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator, but, of everything we found, the balcony is undoubtedly the most endearing. From the third floor you can witness"
50,"A friend and I stayed here for a long weekend (4 nights Saturday through Wednesday). We wanted a good base from town to explore local beaches, and a pool in case we wanted to stay in. When we arrived we were upgraded to a suite with a private kitchen and small private pool on the balcony. Really great, central location. Helpful staff, beds were comfortable, everything was clean, and daily housekeeping was perfect. Thanks for a great stay!"
50,"We headed to Escondido on a bus for the night and just walked to the first place we found. I loved the look of it immensely! So unique and interesting. Fantastic grounds and pool.   The gentleman named Sergio I believe assisted us, gave us great information on the town, suggestions on where to go and what to do, and we had a couple of rooms to choose from so we took a king suite on the 3rd floor. What a view, huge terrace, comfy bed, I only wish we could have stayed for the week. If we are ever back there we will be staying here no question. And what a great deal!"
40,"We were happy with the room. It is somewhat dated, but acceptably so. The A/C was useless, way to noisy. The front desk people were very helpful and friendly. It is less then a 10 minute walk to the bay and to the main street with plenty of good food to be had. The night were quite, I am sure much quieter then any hotel on the main street. Good food to be had at the small restaurant on the south corner of the street the hotel is on. The hotel has on site parking that is locked during the night. Wifi was spotty. The hotel has a nice large pool."
50,"I had a really lovely room with a great view, overlooking Puerto Escondido. It was air-conditioned and spacious, with a really good shower. The staff were all incredibly friendly and welcoming. It is far enough from the main strip to offer solitude and quiet, while being close enough to easily get into town."
30,"The reviews are pretty accurate about this hotel. It is dated but comfortable enough for the area.  WiFi: spotty at best. On par for Mexico. Location: pretty centrally located near main beach, Supermarket, bus station and restaurants and shopping. One can walk to many places (note: PE itself has lots of steps and ups and downs). Mexico isn't very ADA friendly.  Not too many resort style hotels so this place is on par for PE. Cabs are cheap and plentiful."
50,"Hotel Paraiso Escondido was a wonderful place to stay. The staff(most of the time it was Luis) was friendly, helpful, courteous and fairly bilingual. The location was just far enough off the main drag to give it a quiet atmosphere. Clean rooms, nice swimming pool. Sergio helped us with some cancellations and reservations and we were given directions and recommendations whenever we asked for them. When we return to Puerto Escondido we will certainly stay here again. Roland Eyssautier"
50,"If you're looking for a quiet middle-class hotel and don't need 4 or 5 star luxury, I can highly recommend Hotel Parasols Escondido.  The architecture is traditional with well built structures and many charming and original features. We had a room on the 2nd floor which was simple but  clean and with a large balcony with a nice view of the hotel garden and pool - also very clean and relaxing. We were here mid-season so rates were very reasonable, but did not include breakfast. The hotel restaurant wasn't open, but there are good and cheap restaurants within walking distance or a short taxi ride into town. The hotel owner Sergio is very friendly and knowledgeable and let us bring our family to use the pool after a day on the beach. We will stay here again when visiting Puerto"
50,"Hotel Paraiso is a lovely oldish(1975) hotel with a ton of atmosphere.  Most of the rooms have beautiful views of the bay and they all have private terraces.  There are amazing artistic and architectural details in every corner.  Murals and sculpture everywhere you turn.  The pool is large enough for laps and the shaded patio perfect for reading or naps in the hammocks.  The four suites on the top floor have access to a small kitchen with a large refridgerator and small cook top-perfect for breakfast, simple lunches and snacks.  Sharing the kitchen does require a little communication and cooperation, but its was an experience we actually came to enjoy.   Yes, the hotel is a bit dated and things occasionaly need to be fixed.  The air conditioner in our room had a fit one night"
50,"You always have to consider the price/quality ratio with hotels and this one scores very high. We especially liked the staff and the atmosphere here. Everyone was very helpful, also on thinking about trips and where to go.   The place is in a slightly quieter part of town but everything feels very safe about it. We could go out at night without any trouble. The room was nice and clean and the air conditioning was working well. You had to wait a bit for agua caliente but apparently it's already quite special to find a hot shower in Oaxaca. The pool has hammocks which is very nice.  Nice place, good value for money, recommended!"
50,"Great location with great amigo staffs! Perfect chilling and surfing house and friendly staffs.   Nice reef goofy breaks point is walking distance. Although the point is bit busy, you can request a surf tour to other beautiful points.  Definitely, return here In near future!  Saludos!"
40,"First time surfers, we had to reschedule the lesson because the waves were too big and it was not safe. Very proffesional staff. We got all the equipment we needed. David is very friendly.  We did not stay in the hotel, we just took the surf lessons."
50,We stayed here in Nov 2015 and had a great time. Room number 5 is awesome with a fantastic view. The Kitchen and the common area is great to meet and chat with the other guests. The surf School and instructors are really professional. Thanks to Neicer and Coco. Restaurants and Cafés are just a few steps around the corner.
50,"I left Puerto Surf House this past Saturday and was very sad to go.  Along with meeting some great fellow guests, Neiser, Pulpo, Oscar, and Coco were great teachers.  Pulpo especially really helped me understand the waves better.  By the end of the week, I was standing up the like a pro surfer and catching some decent waves (for me, at least).   Outside of the surfing, the house is a great place to relax with hammocks and places to chill.  Really good environment for getting to know your fellow guests and teachers.    The area around is small and has only dirt roads.  Which is awesome as I spent most of my time in bare feet.  There a number of small restaurants nearby and some small markets, as well as fruit stands.  If you want more food choices, the downtown is but a cheap and"
50,"A friend and I stayed here for 6 nights and it was great. Rooms where great and the hammock, lounge area was perfect for a post-surf chill. My friend was already an experienced surfer so he rented a board, from a wide selection, and mostly surfed on his own, but also took a lesson from Neiser on more of an intermediate level and enjoyed it. I'm a beginner and took a bunch of lessons and enjoyed them as well. The boys had you up on waves all the time and were honestly interested in interacting/giving you feedback. Good way to practice your Spanish as well. What really set this place apart was the location and staff. You are 100 ft from the beach at La Punta, which is the intermediate in Puerto, and the neighborhood is just what you want in a beach haven. Sandy roads, good food,"
50,"Puerto Surf House gets a 5/5 from me! It's 30 metres from the beach, with excellent food options close by. The vibe is laid back, yet the staff are attentive and helpful and will organise anything from Spanish classes to board/bike hire, etc. The top room is worth the small extra price, with a wrap-around view, including the point itself. I had a blissed out week here and would happily recommend it to anyone else, Nick from Australia."
50,"Very comfortable clean tropical accommodations. We stayed in 2 rooms both were excellent.  Room 1 was very clean with an attached bathroom and ceiling fan. Its on the first floor next to the kitchen area.  Room 5 was also very clean with an attached bathroom and is much larger located on the the 3rd floor with a great view.  David and his team of Coco, Carlos and Naser are the best of the best surf instructors in the area. They took us every morning at 830 am surfing for 2-3 hours and made sure we were catching wave after wave.   My family and I had the best time and we will be back."
50,"We stayed here for nearly one week and loved it. The place is super clean and the garden with all of its hammocks is a great place to chill out. We met lots of like minded people when we were here, not a party place but definitely somewhere you can have a few beers and hang out. We did not take the surf lessons because we can already surf but those who did have them said they were very good....more than just someone pushing you, with proper instruction. If you're coming to escondido this place definitely comes highly recommended."
50,"Puerto surf house is a little gem located right by La Punta Beach. If you are looking for a great, tranquil, picturesque accommodation don't think twice about booking a stay here. The house has an atmosphere for almost any type of trip one may want to take (i.e. family, meeting people, laid back vacation); any amount of time spent here is guaranteed to be worthwhile. Located a short 7 min taxi drive to the center of town & Zicatela beach allows you to be close enough to the happening night life but far enough to not be disturbed by noise. There is a kitchen for cooking meals or yummy nearby restaurants. David is very attentive to all his guests and always available to answer any questions, give tips, or even show you around his hometown.      Don’t forget to take at least one"
50,"What can I say apart from wow. David and Swantje are more than accommodating, they make you feel like apart of a family you never knew you had.  The house is well decked out with a amazing outdoor kitchen, a beautiful garden to which you can enjoy a nice sit down meal or chill out in a hammock.  For the surfers now. David and Swantje have an awesome selection of surfboards you can hire, and the price is way cheaper then from any other person in the town. Now you have your board your 40sec walk from La Punta (the point) This wave is an unbelievable left hand break. I was there as a magical swell came through. I'm talking 8-10ft wave sets😝. This place is hectic. Even on the days before the swell 4-6ft NICE👌  Now if you think that's too much David was more than helpful letting go"
50,"Loved that the hotel had private access to one of the best beaches in PE, Playa Carrizalillo and that it's a short walk to the Rinconada, with a great variety of restaurants and the walk to Plaza Zicatella is easy, too.  The location is great.  The food is even better - during our stay we were able to sample breakfast, lunch and dinner and each experience was fantastic, fresh food prepared in innovative ways.  The staff was very helpful, arranging excursions for us and keeping in touch via text.  I researched the rooms extensively before booking because my husband and I enjoy having a glass of wine at the end of the day on a patio or balcony.  We were in Villa Terrazza, which has a large, expansive covered deck with a table and hammocks overlooking the beach.   I understand that"
50,"Amazing place, beautiful views, excellent service! Absolutely a spotless room well attended to daily. Very comfy king size bed! Highly recommend the Escondido suite!! A wall of windows let’s you watch surfers from your room. We also had a delicious breakfast there!! A quick walk to the beach and just about 10mins to all kinds of restaurants!"
50,"Stayed in one of their villas with kitchenette and two rooms, patio with hammock and small outdoor dining area.  We were able to go into town (about 10 min. away and stock up with food from the market).  There is a restaurant on the hotel grounds (good but expensive for Oaxaca).  It had   the most amazing views witnessed whales and the sound from the beach below made for one of the best travel experiences! There is access to the beach below (Playa Carrizalillo) and Puerto Angelito is a ten minute walk down the road.  Excellent location."
50,I stayed at Villas Carrizalillo for four nights and LOVED it. Some of the best views in Mexico with comfortable beds/rooms. The restaurant is great too. I highly recommend Villas Carrizalillo for anyone traveling to Puerto Escondido. Amazing location too!
50,"We recently stayed at Villas Carrizalillo for a long weekend.  It was our first stay at the hotel, and we loved our time there.  Our room was large, comfortable, and very well maintained.  We also loved the sound of the waves and the views from both our room and the restaurant.  The direct access to the beach and the short walk to the restaurants were also much appreciated. The location is simply excellent.  We only had two minor issues with our stay.  First, the WiFi needs to be upgraded.  It’s very slow, and we gave up on it several times.  It was quicker and easier to use cellular data.  Second, the hotel limits what you get for the included breakfast. It amounts to one egg, one piece of bread, and about eight cubes of fresh fruit.  Coffee OR juice is also included.  At the"
30,"Staff cooking & other personnel were not using facemasks! Watiters attitude ther worst I have ever seen. No one cares about COVID-19. The day we left Puerto Escondido authorities were closing restaurants and beaches due to a new increase in contagions. One of the best views I ever seen though.  I do not recommend this hotel during COVID-19, staff do not seem to care."
50,"I had never been to Mexico before staying at this beautiful villa. Needless to say I have set the bar pretty high now! Panoramic views and the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen. Make it a point to be on the patio before sunset otherwise you will miss it, or all the good seats will be taken! It's a small hotel so does not feel crowded. The restaurant is really good and gaining popularity amongst tourists staying at other nearby locations so I recommend making a reservation for dinner. Definitely the best pina colodas and margaritas I have ever had! We felt like we had a more authentic Mexico stay than compared to an all-inclusive resort and that's exactly what we were looking for on our first trip to Mexico."
50,In the most beautiful location; this authentic and wonderful hotel was our introduction to Oaxaca and this fantastic stretch of coastline. We loved our room and the sound of the Pacific Ocean at the base of the cliffs. The beach is superb and offers awesome snorkling. The view from the restaurant of the ocean and beach is magical. Hard to think of a better place to enjoy a Margarita and watch the sun set. The surf of Puerto Escondido is a cheap taxi ride away. Will definitely return.
50,"We returned for a 2nd, week long visit to Villas Carrizalillo and it remains as stunning as the 1st visit.   Keep in mind, this boutique villa is comfortable without being over the top luxury... The view is one of the very best we've enjoyed in our world travels.   The gardens are beautiful. The atmosphere is tranquil. The team is quality.   Loved the panoramic view from our room, Escondido.   Easy 10 minute walk to the rinconida for a variety of restaurants, a few retail clothing stores and a few grocery items.   You must walk or taxi into the main town and you will enjoy the large local market and many wonderful, inexpensive food options.   We hope to return again and again as i hope the travelers and the locals work together to maintain the natural beauty and cultural"
50,"We stayed in the Puebla room, which was very large and has an amazing view of the ocean. All night long, we could hear the peaceful crashing of the waves down below.   Playa Carrizalillo, which this hotel provides a special access stairway to, is one of the most beautiful beaches we have ever seen, purely idyllic, with perfect waves for surfing, a lovely stretch of sand with umbrellas and chairs to rent and food and drink shacks.  Plus, there is a giant sea turtle who hangs out in the water there! There's also a nice pool and shared roofdeck area, and a lovely ocean view restaurant.  We recommend a meal there at sunset, it's for sure the best view in PE. Everyone is very friendly and the service is great."
10,"This Hotel is far away from puerto escondido town. Very calm and nice environment  When a place like this has a bad management is not posible to have a good team. They have to call the taxis to pick you up , they have to help with reservation, is in the middle of nothing, but management don’t help. Very bad service , not because of the employs its because they don’t know how to do it. We have a nice stay, when we live the place a taxi that they call came to pick us up and the back of the taxi was wet. We ask for a towel, and the manager didnt want to give us and she vas rude. Also the cover of the room has stain and not toilet paper in the room , you have to call every day. Never space for aspa treatment, they don’t have people to do it. Not recommended until change management,"
40,"One of the 15 spacious palapas, up little winding paths , with their own plunge pools , a hop skip and jump from the beach, was our home for 5 nights. This exquisite  room was only marred by an enormous. TV (surely not required) and the poor lighting which made bed time reading virtually impossible, although appreciated use of solar power may be the cause of this. The a la carte food was excellent and the cocktails superb but the set menu dinners could be disappointing. Included breakfast not particularly exciting either. The staff were wonderful and nothing was too much trouble. The pool bar was closed during our stay so they spent a lot of time running across hot sand collecting drinks from the restaurant always with a smile!! Be warned that this hotel is often used as a "
50,"My wife and I came here for our honeymoon after getting married in Oaxaca City. We drove down from Oaxaca on highway 131, which we’ll never do again, because it was the most stressful and harrowing drive I’ve ever done. So, after the 7+ hour drive through the mountains and more potholes than you can shake a stick at we finally arrived at hotel Escondido. What a welcome sight after that drive. The peaceful and quiet nature of the hotel immediately put us at ease. It’s got a super cool design and is immersed in nature not just sat on top of it. We spent most of our days sipping cocktails by the pool because the surf was a little too rough to swim in but we didn’t mind. The pool, the food and the vibe were immaculate. Not too many people around but just enough to have some cool"
30,We stayed here twice. First time was 2 nights in May 2021 the second time was for 5 nights on November 2021. On the first night of our second visit I woke up with many bed bug bites all over my body. It ruined the rest of my stay. The hotel staff changed the mattress and cleaned the room but other than that did not yield much. Manager made it seem as if getting bed bug bites was part of the experience of staying in a remote location like this. Be prepared for less than sympathetic staff. The location and design of the hotel are nice but it seems overpriced for what you get. There are more affordable and better places to stay in the area. For what you are paying I found the service was average and was not impressed. I wouldn’t stay there again nor recommend it. Only thing
50,"After spending a few spectacular days, very happy, I had an incident that makes me very hesitant to return. The last night I slept there at 2AM a scorpion came to my pillow and stung at my head. It was a terrible, painful, and very disconcerting experience. Half of my face and tongue fell asleep, I had a big headache, and my eyes were clouded.  But equally complicated was that I did not have clarity what I should do, how to react to a situation with that gravity. The hotel maintenance janitor arrived, an extremely simple, friendly, and helpful man, but obviously unable to guide me or support me with medical or technical assistance that would give me peace of mind. The same happened with the person at the reception who sent me a painkiller and an antihistamine to resolve the"
50,"Hotel Escondido is paradise! This is the most luxurious and peaceful hotel we’ve ever stayed at. We loved every aspect of our romantic vacation at this gorgeous boutique resort: the individual casitas are beautiful and each has a private patio and pool, the food was phenomenal, the large infinity pool and private beach are gorgeous, the massage and facial were very relaxing, and the staff was very friendly and attentive.  We especially enjoyed talking with Omar, who was our server each evening. He is very kind and excellent at his job. He greeted us whenever he walked by, always asking us how we were doing and if he could bring us any food or drinks. He was also patient as we practiced ordering in Spanish.  We were nervous about whether the restaurant would be able to"
20,"The hotel has a nice design but is very basic, nothing special. The only amenity is the swimming pool and considering that we are in an area of Mexico that you can not swim in the ocean due to high tide, is the only way to refresh yourself.  The room air-condition was not working properly so it was extremely hot during the day. The light in the room is too dim. There is no coffee maker in the room, but the biggest issue for us was the food. They included breakfast and dinner in their very overprice and expensive rate. This could be a good option if we had a good quality food. I and my friend we both got food poisoning from the first day and we had to cut short our trip and fly back earlier. The breakfast they offer is very poor, bowl of granola and yogurt and fruit and the rest"
30,"As other reviews around here point out, staff is not well trained, a lot of new people.  This said, we were here 3 months ago and the place was fantastic as well as the food and staff almost Michelin-star level.   To our disappointment this second visit was not as expected.  The rates were raised and the benefits were reduced. Not a full breakfast is included as before and quality of food has declined considerable to the point of not being able to eat some of the dishes. This hotel is definitely a place to do nothing but enjoy the view, place and food. If the food doesn’t work (note that there is nowhere else to go around here) and there are no amenities (it’s ok. That’s why you are here) then it loses half of its value.  Cocktails are fenomenal and well priced.   We were"
30,"Stayed here in May. Property is stunning and room is beautiful.  Love the beach access and privacy. Something to note is that it is far from city center of puerto Escondido (45 min taxi) which is great for a secluded escape but hard if you are wanting to explore and eat out. The lower star rating was for the lack of effective AC and service.  It was extremely hot and while there are AC units, the rooms have lots of openness to the outdoors and do not get cool. Made it very difficult to sleep. A few of the concierge were not super helpful with things like booking reservations or advising on travel around the area (we were able to find someone more helpful ultimately who ended up being fantastic) but a bit surprised given the price point and prior reviews."
40,"Location: 40 min taxi ride from the airport. Secluded hotel, very private and exclusive (16 rooms tops). Beachfront, but the downside is that the sea is not swimmable at all (waves and currents are deadly). Hotel is simple yet beautiful. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. Gorgeous main swimming pool (best part of the hotel).   Food: Average. Expected a better breakfast (only included: fruit, toast, juice and coffee). You can order eggs, etc. at an extra cost. Desserts are very mediocre. Stay away from the octopus, cheesecake and “mole”brownie.   Amenities: Basic. Free wifi throughout the hotel, but the quality is very low - not for work purposes.   Staff: Very friendly and attentive. Uriel, one of the waiters, is fantastic.  Overall, great experience. Would give it five"
40,"I have stayed here multiple times throughout the years.  When going to Puerto, I wouldn't stay anywhere else now.  I love their atmosphere, balconies overlooking the waves on Zicatela, cheap and delicious breakfast at the hotel restaurant, the beautiful pool, access to all the wonderful things to find in the shops and restaurants along this stretch of beach.  Even the diversity of choice when it comes to room selection.  Taxis from here to beaches where you can swim are also cheap.  All around it's great and has a great surfer vibe due to the surfer crowd on Zicatela.  People come here from all over the world for the waves on that beach.  I would recommend this place for all these reasons.  The ONE thing I ever had a problem with here was the staff--who can be grumpy and"
40,"This hotel has charm with rooms ""U"" shaped around large pool and restaurant.  Some with kitchenette.  Walk across the street onto Zicatela beach, beautiful beach, great for surfing but currents too strong for swimming.  Hotel is inexpensive and friendly people, occasionally drops the ball with service but if you remind them they forgot to put towels in your room they immediately do so.  I liked it, stayed there twice. Downside is the awful noise on holiday weekends from the all night music of the bars and discos on Zicatela."
40,have stayed twice at this hotel. offers a variety of rooms for different task and budgets. staff helpful and accomodating.  Natalie at reception just great. Try staying at bunglow named heike. when first arrived also checked out santa fe and  arco iris hotel. The first over rated and pricey and the second a bit outdated and run down. To us Ines is the best deal in town.  Best place to watch the sunset is a restaurant/ bar named Sativa. Their happy hr drinks are fantastic just as its food. A shill out place if you are looking for something other than the typical mexican taberna.
20,"First impressions last and the owner is a grump... They seem very disorganized... Rooms, our A/c sounded like a truck was driving through the room, the bathroom smelt very unpleasant, wasn't clean and all floors were tacky under foot.... Pool needs a good clean! We are not precious travelers but its called the 'service' industry for a reason guys... Sort yourself out.."
10,"This place is a complete mess. We made our reservation on line, and made a wire transfer. When we arrive, they didn't had our reservation. However, they gave us a room. The room was very simple. Two double beds, with a/c. And one bathroom. However the bathroom was filthy. The shower did no have any curtains or walls so all the water splashes all over the bathroom. They have a really good pool in size, but when I got in it was slippery because of lack of cleaning.  Great location even all the other problems. Sadly, this is one of the best hotels in the area. So if you do not have high standards in hotels go here. If you do, think again. Maybe think of Acapulco or Huatulco.  "
50,"Having luckily travelled to many parts of our planet Hotel Ines has been a absolute gem. Everyone,from Ines and Lorenzo the owners, to all the staff have been wonderful. The restaurant is excellent and I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a piece of a truly special place. Rod Torr."
50,"we recently stayed at Hotel Ines after finding it in the Lonely Planet guide. We arrived without a booking early in the morning after a long overnight bus trip and were given a choice of 3 completely different styled tooms.  we chose a huge split-level room with ceiling fans above the beds (quiet & not scary!) and a balcony overlooking the pool.  the restaurant was great, the staff friendly (especially helpful was Natalie) My husband was most unwell for the first 2 days but my son and I were more than happy hanging out by the pool & eating in the lovely poolside restaurant at Ines... so happy that we didnt even walk across the road to see the beach for 2 days!! there was a great mix of families and older people (a lot of whom were regular visitors to Ines - staying for weeks on"
40,"Timely and helpful service. Great atmosphere and well off the street. Residents looked gleefulabut everything.  We were there for a very good dinner. Clever,small fresh flower arrangements on tables. Very tast  curry sauce chicken and chicken stroganoff. Not exactly as described - probably better. Such a nice evening  We will go back at least once during our stay."
50,"Puerto Escondido is my favorite Pacific resort, a word that should be put in quotation marks since it still retains a smidgeon of fishing village (if you squint).  I loved my first stay at the famous Plymouth near the Adoquin, but I wanted on the second trip to find out what life was like on Zicatela, the internationally known surfer beach.  The  Ines is probably the best bargain for what you get.  The owners are Europeans and they know value, so you get good if basic rooms, fortunately large enough to qualify as ""suites"" sans the accoutrements one pays more for in, say, the Mayan Riviera joints.  I loved my first stay there with my sons and they wanted to go back a couple of years later and we ended up in exactly the same room on the second floor overlooking Zicatela beach. "
40,The staff is friendly and the location is excellent. The restaurant is tasty and affordable. The rooms are tiny but comfortable generally. The pool area is lovely and welcoming. It is across from the main beach area and steps from shops and restaurants.
50,"We visited as a small family in celebration of a birthday. We were looking for an all inclusive on the beach with a pool however small and intimate hence Gecko Rock. Only 4 sparkling clean rooms each with a comfortable king sized bed, cascading shower heads and individual rooftop terraces complete with a hammock, chairs and a table. Perfect sunrise, sunset and ocean views.  The communication from the very first email throughout our stay was accommodating and clear. Mike and Aileen were interested in food preferences and diet restrictions to coordinate meals with special requests. A perfect family style birthday dinner and cake were so lovingly prepared. The pool is beautiful and ready for hrs of floating about.  The beach is lovely, quiet and great for long walks. The water is a"
50,"We were looking for a warm December getaway, as a 30 something couple that aren't into the party scene of the built up tourist areas.  What we found was an Oasis of beautiful scenery, friendly hotel owners, and meals that were absolutely perfect.  Anyone who is looking for similar will find a perfect vacation.  Just one tip, road conditions in Mexico are poor, this hotel like many in the area, is located along a dirt beach road, we recommend renting an SUV or Jeep in general for traveling the area.  You can also take a taxi to the resort for a relatively minimal expense.  Thank you Mike and Aileen, we wish you the best and hope to visit again."
40,"We were staying in Oaxaca City and were confounded by some unusually bad weather, so on the spur of the moment we decided to fly down to the coast and try to just chill out. We decided to take a chance on this little spot, and I'm glad we did.   Mike and Aileen have made it their mission to provide a haven that is far from the crazy crowds. Their resort is about 45 minutes from Puerto Escondido, so if you're looking for nightlife and restaurants, this isn't your place. But if you want a quiet spot with a lovely pool, comfortable room, and ocean breezes, you could do far worse than Gecko Rock. In fact, I think a sensible vacation would be to spend a few days in town, with the hubbub and vendors and restaurants, and then a few days here, to really get away from it all.  The resort"
50,"Aileen and Mike without doubt are the nicest hosts and nothing is too much trouble. Recommend staying here for an unforgettable break. Perfect for relaxing, great food and thoroughly enjoyed every minute"
50,"Beautiful private, quiet beach resort. Perfect for relaxing and exploring rural mexican culture and habitat in a safe atmosphere. Excellent food, hospitality and personal service. Truly paradise. Mike & Aileen have worked hard with attention to detail and personalized service."
50,"We stayed here for two nights. The room was spacious, clean and had a balcony with a nice view of the beach. The hammock was a plus :). Staff were very friendly and hospitable, especially Dayma. Lots of places to eat nearby and a good 20 minute ride from the airport. Will definitely come back!"
50,"The staff, the food, the beach, the hotel, it was all incredible.  I cannot say enough nice things about the general manager.  He was an amazing person who really went above and beyond to help us on our last day of the trip.  I have recommended this hotel to every one that I know and I will definetly be back!"
50,"Wonderful staff, excellent service and clean comfortable rooms.  The general manager is a standard of what every hotel general manager should be.  The property grounds were immaculate.  The food was amazing!  I have recommended this place to all of my friends and family and I will definitely be back."
10,We spend an afternoon at the cocos beach club and were ripped off! First as we came they charged us with 700 pesos each person. This would include all food and drinks. But nobody came to serve us drinks at the beach! After claiming we received drinks but no one told us that the food only would be served until 4.30 pm. We missed the deadline by 15 minutes and had been offered some snacks and 3 meals. The kitchen had closed. The staff was very rude specially the woman at the reception and didn’t offer us any options. A very expensive afternoon and we felt completely ripped off! Not to be recommended! Some meters away you will find another beach club much cheaper and with friendly service and great food!
40,"The location, beach club, grounds etc are awesome. Food.....not a ton of choices but what they have is top quality. One of the few smaller places that still serve good chicken breast, homemade pizza and tender beef. The rooms are smaller and a little older....but for the price and the amount of time you spend in the room you can't complain. Wifi needs major help.......best place is at the beach club. Service is top notch at dinners / lunches. Front staff is inconsistent. We were charged two different prices for our split stay.....not much more but why wasn't it the same ?  Bar service was good. We would definitely stay again as we love the area."
50,"I had an amazing trip, I must say that this was one of the most interesting trips so far in Mexico!! When I got the the airport I had a driver waiting for me and together we drove about an hour and a half towards Puerto Escondido. The driver was so nice. We stopped halfway at a small restaurant on the side of the road for lunch and had excellent food. Once I got to the hotel I was given a room in the 300 block. The hotel is small but clean. It is not recent but is feels comfortable. The room itself was tiny, no safe, no fridge and quite old with a very small window with a “garden view” Where you really had to stretch out of the window to see the “view”. It felt a little like a prison cell for its size and view. The bed was comfortable though. I requested an upgrade with ocean"
40,"Someone said ""Hidden Gem""...if you're looking for someplace to kick back & come down from the hectic pace of your everyday life, this is the place.  Rooms are nice & very clean; most have been upgraded I heard.  The grounds are well cared for & the beach is miles long.  Staff is amazing & they try to accommodate all your wishes.  Most speak English and they're more than happy to play Charades or Pictionary if you stumble across someone who's not well versed in English.  The maids are lovely ladies and all the wait staff are amazing.  The SunWing rep is Vlad & even though we were WestJet guests, he went way above to help us.  Thanks, Vlad, & thank you to allllll the great staff at Posada!"
40,"The accommodations were good - we were happy we opted for the upgrade to ocean view with balcony (many rooms do not have a balcony).  The staff was superb, from the wait staff in all the bars, restaurants and pool areas, to the maid service.  The food was adequate.  Not extensive buffets, but a good selection of food that tasted good.  The beach and pool areas were top notch, and we loved that we could go anytime of day and always find a chaise lounge.  Don't miss the turtle release just 200 meters north on the beach - 100 pesos and great memories and helping an endangered species.  The one downside was the really terrible wifi - only available in the lobby and main restaurant.  It worked sometimes, but usually not well - just wanted to try to keep in touch with family.   They"
50,"Stayed for 3 nights over Valentine's Day and really enjoyed it! Multiple pools, beach access and club, lounge chairs and even hammocks! We only ate at the breakfast buffet, and it was great. My only complaint would be that the beach bar is understaffed: waited 10-15 minutes in line for drinks every time, and the beach hostess took a drink order once and never returned! At least the hanging chairs at the beach bar made the wait time fun. Lots of chairs set up to watch the beautiful sunsets and there were a couple of weddings and even a music video filming while we were there."
40,"Had a wonderful 5 night stay at this great hotel that caters for all types of groups and people. Firtly its only 5 mins away from the airport which makes for a very comfortable start and finish to a holiday. The buffets are great offering lots of options for the 3 meals of the day however we opted to only have all inclusive drinks and breakfasts as we headed out each day for lunch and dinner. Even when it was busy it was still quiet and calm, plus the service is superb. No games or music by the pool which was wonderful. The hotel sits atop a cliff which gives it both excellent views and 2 levels of pools, with the lower pool being a set of steps or an included car drive away. So worth it as the beach below is expansive, clean and there´s almost no other buildings along the"
50,"Excellent service!! i was so surprised!! the staff was just INCREDIBLE!  The place it´s a little bit old, i think they need to work on that, but drinks, pool, food, beach club, sunset, and staff service were GREAT! "
40,close to zicatel. can t see the beach from hostel but you can hear it. niece accomendations. walk out of hostel right to beach 100 ydsor  left to upper road w great restaurant (locals) it is a walkway to upper main road. great views. the private walkway was amazing. you see how the locals live. very safe when i was their solo.happy hour starts after the siesta 11 am - 3 am extreme heat. love it. no ac but the room i had was into the hillside. rear of room was exposed to the local land owners. in the room you could hear the ocean ask her for that room fan was perfect in december
50,"After a 8.5 hour journey in a minibus from Oaxaca, it was a wonderful relief to arrive at this hotel, see the pool all ready to jump into, and to receive a warm and friendly welcome from the owner. We were given a lovely room with a huge bed (wonderful after several nights in beds designed for much shorter people!). Everything looked and smelt clean and fresh. Other welcome details included a kitchen with free coffee and water refills, and an honesty bar. We immediately grabbed a beer, got into the pool and relaxed for two days. I wish we could have stayed longer!"
50,"It is an ""only adults"" nice and small hotel with only 12 rustic rooms in 2 stories. The Swiss owner welcomed us at our arrival, she is nice and friendly and is there all the time, The whole place is clean and cozy and the ambiance is a very casual European kind. The rooms are small and do not have air conditioning but the ceiling fan was enough for us in January, while the open windows with mosquito nets keep the rooms well ventilated. Upper rooms have extra space with a raised sleeping platform each. The bedding is comfortable. The pool is in great conditions and a small kitchen is available for all. Most of the guests we met were middle age and senior Canadians taking a long break away of their cold winter, since it is a small place it is perfect to make new friends."
50,"This is a simple, but special, place.  Just eight rooms and a small pool, a minute's walk up an unremarkable street from the beach.  But it's very Swiss in all the right ways--orderly, reliable, spotless.  Plus some nice, culturally uncategorizable touches--the friendly cats roaming the premises, the common kitchen with complimentary coffee available at all hours.  The owners are ready to chat and offer their recommendations, and ready as well to give you your space.  They deliberately avoid creating a high-end boutique hotel, so if that's what you're looking for look elsewhere.  But for everybody else:  Highly recommended."
50,"Based on all the positive traveller and guide book reviews, we picked the Hotelito Swiss Oasis for our 4-night stay in Puerto Escondido in November.  The hotel didn’t disappoint – it was a lovely place to stay!  The owners made us feel really welcome from the moment we stepped through the gate- providing a few good tips about the local area and showing us to our room.  Tucked away from the laid-back restaurants and bars of Playa Zicatela, the hotel is quiet and peaceful….a perfect place to relax for a few days.  The drinks ‘honesty fridge’ with tally chart was a great touch in such a humid climate, and the pool became the perfect place to relax after a few hours on the beach.  Hotelito Swiss Oasis is well maintained, immaculately clean, and also great value.  We had a fantastic"
50,"This is a small hotel with 8 rooms.  It has been decorated with charming Mexican tiles and ceramics.  The foliage is lovely.  The pool is in perfect condition as is everything else.  The king size beds are comfortable.  A beverage fridge gives you a selection of cold beer, juices, and water for $1 each.  There is a kitchen stocked with appliances, utensils,condiments, and coffee for your use.  Guests can share unused bug spray, sunscreen, shampoo and beach gear.     It is located a half block from the Main Street across from the beach, a one minute walk. Its adults only but the vibe is family friendly. I could stay here over and over again as other guests often do."
50,"We've been at Hotelito Swiss Oasis a few weeks ago. It is a real Oasis in the middle of Puerto Escondido. The layout is extra ordinary! Beautiful flowers and plants. Lots of little details which matches the whole Oasis. Mariella, our host was very helpful and friendly. Coming back to the Oasis from the beach, we had always a nice relaxing time at the pool. For sure, we will go back there. We just can recommend this little Oasis in the busy town of Puerto Escondido!"
50,"This is a great little hotel.  Rooms are on the small side but beds are king sized and mattresses & pillows are excellent. The rooms are thoroughly cleaned daily.   The small communal kitchen is useful.  Some guests use it a lot and others just use it to chill water in the communal fridge.  There are no fridges in the rooms.  I think the swimming pool is approximately 30' in length so it's possible to swim laps and due to the small size of the hotel, there is plenty of room around the pool.  The hotel is in close proximity to restaurants and bars.  There is only one small grocery store in walking distance plus an OXXO.  The beach (Zicatela) is very close and beautiful but not swimmable due to high waves and rip tides.  There is plenty of surfing on this beach and the area is"
50,"Recently spent three nights here after deciding to make a quick trip to Puerto Escondido. Didn’t know what to expect but feel like we hit the jackpot. This hidden beauty is located one block off Zicatela Beach which makes it a bit quieter, is immaculately landscaped and maintained, has a lovely pool when you don’t feel like being at the beach and the rooms are just perfect for a couple.  Manuela greets you right away and tours you through their little oasis showing you the kitchen which available for guests and the “honour system” fridge which is always full of cold beverages.  This little hotel it’s even comes with a cat and dog if you’re missing your fur babies back home!"
50,"We have been going to Puerto for 5 years now for Xmas & New Year! Our flight this time was a lot more than usual so we decided to go cheaper with the hotel. Well, had I known about this lovely hotel we would have stayed here every year!! A true Oasis in the heart of Zicatela. Very quiet but with easy access to all the facilities you'd need, with the beach just across the road. Our room was cleaned every day, lovely and cool (No Air Con and it really doesn't matter), the honesty bar was brilliant and kitchen was a great option. Manuela and Rene were very friendly and not intrusive in any way. The pool was perfect for a dip, & lovely and clean. It's not an olympic sized swimming pool but if you want a swimming workout the sea is a minute away. All in all a terrific find and we"
50,"Villa Lili is amazing. My husband wants to go back here every year for his vacation now - he had such an amazing time.  The rooms are comfortable and private, and the hosts take care of your every need.  Breakfast is served al fresco each morning in the dining area, including a hot Oaxacan specialty that's different every day.  Absolutely delicious!"
50,"We spent 5 nights at Villa Lilli with our two kids (9 & 5) and it was FANTASTIC. Our children had a wonderful time swimming in the pool and we enjoyed the amazing breakfast prepared from scratch every morning. We also enjoyed the location due to its proximity to some of the best restaurants in Puerto Escondido and the beach. Additionally, we also loved the friendly atmosphere the owner and his staff promote by making you feel at home. In all, this was a great experience and one I would like to repeat in the future.  Luis is a great host and the entire staff at Villa Lillil are friendly and absolutely helpful!"
50,"Villa Lili was perfect for our honeymoon! The location was great; close to the beach and restaurants. The pool is perfect and surrounded by a beautiful orchid garden. There is relaxing music around the pool and a bar, even stocked with locally brewed beer! Adelina and her team were all so friendly and fun. Breakfast every morning was a joy to wake up to with hot breakfast and fresh fruits and juices. Adelina also helped us organize an excellent bio-luminescence tour and gave us a map with the best places to visit in Puerto Escondido."
50,"We stayed here as a family with out 2 children, aged 9 & 11. We had a beautifully spacious room with a double and 2 singles. The pool area is lovely, with plenty of shade, and sun loungers both in and out of shade. Breakfasts were delicious, and we were well looked after. Luis, the owners brother was here, and sorted out surf lessons, a fishing trip as well as a trip to the Laguna. The hotel is only a couple of minutes from some of the best eateries in Puerto Escondidi, so it's a great location, and the beach is great for learning to surf as well as being a much quieter beach than others."
50,"We spent a relaxing and enjoyable week here. The hostess, Adelina, and her staff are lovely and helpful. A delicious breakfast is served every morning and we enjoyed sipping beer that is brewed at the hotel from the honesty bar in the evenings. We loved the modern design of the hotel and the quirky room. It is in a peaceful location with no noise pollution! The rooms and grounds are impeccable and Adelina has a beautiful collection of orchids. We would definitely come back."
50,Villa Lili is without doubt the best place to stay at Puerto Escondido. It is personally attended by its owner which keeps the place running perfectly. Breakfast is excellent and its included during your stay.
50,"Villa Lilli was perfect for us.  The rooms are lovely and clean.  The breakfasts were delicious.  The service perfect.   This is not a large, fancy hotel, so if you are looking for an all inclusive resort, this is not it, but Peurto Escondido is a fantastic, ""undiscovered"" little town, and Villa Lilli is the nicest play to stay!"
50,"Run by the lovely Adelina and her friendly team, Villa Lili was a wonderful home-away-from-home on our trip to Puerto Escondido. We arrived early after our flight from Oaxaca and were welcomed with a breakfast of Chicken tinga tostadas (delicious) freshly made by the team. Breakfast each day did not disappoint with fresh fruit from the market, freshly made mexican and local specialties as well as cereal or pancakes for people wanting something basic. The house is beautiful, we stayed in the ""Top Master Suite"" which offered ocean views, though may not be the best choice for visitors who may struggle with stairs as it is the highest room in the house. The communal areas include two pools, various lounge chairs and an ""honesty fridge"" filled with drinks including home brewed craft"
50,"We just spent a week at villa Lili. It was our first trip to Puerto Escondido, we really lucked out. Villa Lili's location is perfect, a block from Playa Carrizalillo, and two blocks from the shops and restaurants of the Rinconada. The accommodations are ideal for folks looking for a beach vacation with more than basic luxuries: nicely appointed and clean rooms; a swimming pool; and wonderful hospitality. Adelina and her staff go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. Breakfast prepared by Josefina and Sylvia was the highlight of our day. Adelina had all sorts of ideas for day trips and helped make the arrangements for us (to the turtle release, the Laguna, and horseback riding). It's the kind of place you come back to. We look forward to our next trip. "
50,My family loved Villa Lili.  The room was very comfortable and was the perfect size for our family of four.  The hotel is within easy walking distance of the beach and numerous restaurants.  We very much appreciated the excellent suggestions of Adelina regarding restaurants and area attractions and especially enjoyed two activities --- releasing baby turtles and the dolphin and tortoise watching tour.
50,"While I stayed at Posada Real I preferred eating out. I met someone on the plane who recommended this place for breakfast. It is hidden behind the busy Avenida Benito Juárez but what a delight it was. First the garden is beautiful, it felt like an oasis on such an already hot morning. I met a friend for breakfast and ordered a latte while I waited for him to arrive. The attention to details and the delicate presentation added to the feel of the oasis. We ordered our breakfast and felt like time had stopped. The service as well as the food was amazing and for just a little over 200 pesos we ate like royalty! I would absolutely recommend this place for a perfect way to start the day!"
50,A perfect little “villa” right in the middle of a beautiful garden. Excellent breakfast and late afternoon drinks in the new bar. Welcoming and charming. Easy walking to the quiet and safe beach down a long but manageable set of stairs . Around the block to fine restaurants of every price and taste. I hope to go back one day!
50,"We enjoyed 2 wonderful weeks in the bungalow. Angie, and her colleagues - especially Ivanna - took care of us with generosity and kindness. Loved everything - the lush tropical garden and its sculptures, all beautifully tended. Inside and outside was so artistic and intimate. Generous and tasty breakfast was served a few steps away in the open dining space. The location was quiet and a short walk (or cheap taxi ride) from beaches where we swum, snorkelled and relaxed in the thatched shade provided by numerous restaurants. We only wish we could return tomorrow!"
50,"It can be a bit worrisome booking into a place and location that you know almost nothing about. However we had no need to worry; we were very pleasantly surprised. Villa Mozart y Mocondo is an oasis in a quiet area of Puerto Escondido. Very tasteful bungalows with lots of space and very beautifully designed/decorated. ,Extremely well kept grounds and with artworks throughout. On-site out-door restaurant and reading area nestled in palm trees and gardens. The service and staff are fabulous and the owner attentive and gracious. The people running the Villa really made our stay very special; simply excellent!"
40,"I think there are four units, Two bungalows and a two story building that I think houses two units.  We stayed in the bungalow with an outside kitchen and it was lovely.    We were greeted on arrival and there are staff on site each morning (from about 7am).  It’s all very private and quiet.  You can buy breakfast on site.  There’s limited choice but it’s very good.  The rooms are cleaned and the garden is tended each day.  Apart from that you are left to it.  This suited us very well.  It’s just a five minute walk to the top of the steps leading to Carrizalillo beach; a couple of minutes to the strip where there are a number of restaurants/cafes/shops; and a leisurely ten minute walk to a nice viewing point.  Puerto Angelito is maybe a 15-20 minute walk.  We took a taxi to"
50,"Had a wonderful one week stay. Most nights were in one of the bungalows and a couple of nights at a double room. Bungalow is fantastic, really clean and comfortable. The double room was a bit smaller but spotless and very functional.  Garden is fantastic. Breakfast really good -not to many options- but everything was delicious. But the key element is the amazing service by the owner and all staff.  Location may not be the best option for everyone since you have to walk a bit to the beach. But if you are looking for a place with personality, a great service, this is it. "
50,"We stayed in one of the gorgeous bungalows for 6 nights. It's a beautiful and peaceful place to spend time in. A great location for the beach and a range of restaurants too.  One night a painting fell off the wall and onto our bed while we were sleeping! But apart from that we loved all the art inside and outside the bungalow 😀   The staff are there if you need them for recommendations, taxis, or just a good cup of coffee. They are always tending to the beautiful garden. Ivana was really helpful and friendly. We'd happily return again in the future."
50,"The best place to stay in Puerto Escondido if you want to be in a beautiful, peaceful room that is minutes from the beach and still super convenient to excellent restaurants and amenities. It was a pleasure to wake up here every morning and plan the day.  Housekeeping was impeccable and the art and books in each room were lovely touches. We also loved the location--a lush, winding garden with hammocks, chairs, and sculptures.  It's just 5 minutes walk to Playa Carrizalillo, which is the most gorgeous (and best for swimming) beach in the area.  We will absolutely be back!"
50,"Such a low-key, gorgeous place. We went for a quick weekend to escape Mexico City and are so happy we found this hotel.  The room was super cozy, SPOTLESS, and actually exceeded my expectations.  The location is fantastic - there are plenty of restaurants within a short distance and the best beach is just a block or two away (then 100 stairs down to the beach, but it makes the first dip in the water that much better).   Service was exceptional and they were extremely accommodating to our needs.   Breakfast was great and with very hearty portions.   We will definitely stay here on our next visit to Pto Escondido."
50,"This is it. You found it. This place is the most wonderful hotel/home (It feels like a home) that I've ever stayed in. There is a gorgeous, lush garden, which you wind your way through to get to your lovely room. No TV (believe me, you don't want it or need it when you're here). All there is, is a lovely shower, a huge bed, and a gorgeous cafe outside to get your morning chilaquiles and cafe.  I stayed here with my husband on our honeymoon. We told the (WONDERFUL) owners that it was our honeymoon and (without telling us) they set up a bottle of wine, fresh tropical fruit and flowers in our room. They adorned our doorway with a wreath of flowers. I was beyond touched, but that's the kind of service you get here. It is a home away from home, it is beautiful, secret, and perfect."
50,"Tabachin hotel offers the Perfect relaxing getaway for people of all ages, the friendly staff make you you feel right at home and the complimentary continental breakfast is simply amazing! Being young backpackers it was a little expensive for our budget but when we saw the rooms and the roof top view which sweeps from the point right down to the lighthouse we were sold. The owner Don Pablo which has lived locally for the past 30 years goes out of his way to make your stay at comfortable as possible and has a great local knowledge on the area! The location of Tabachin adds to the relaxing feel being tucked away in a quiet side street with no through traffic. All and all I would recommend this hotel to anybody looking for quiet beach getaway with excellent service! "
50,"Studios Tabachin del Puerto, is a great spot off the main strip (which is one of the reasons I liked it so much) It was quiet and nicely appointed, with friendly, helpful staff. The breakfast is of the best quality you are going to find in Puerto. Organic whenever possible including the coffee, which could be the best cup you might ever have."
50,"It was one of the best hotels in four weeks of mexico. The price was cheeper than Lonely planet said and the rooms are very beautiful and clean. They rooms have kitchen, cable-TV, fans, saves, air conditioning and a good service. The Hotel is very quiet -  not so busy like the ""Surfer-Hotels"". The breakfast ist the best. You can have whatever you want - and it is very huge! The most of the food is selfmade (Juice, yoghurt, cereals, fruits.......) and the owner is very lovely and gives you a lot of tips. It is realy a nice place!!! ps: You can use the pool from the other Hotel ten meters down the street."
50,"The staff was like family. Very helpful, service was wonderful! Paul, the owner spoke English perfectly, which felt so comfortable after travelling Mexico for the previous  month and not being able to communicate well. At first sight, Tabachin seems a bit older,not a ritzy hotel, but very clean and again, I can't say it enough the service, family atmosphere and food are superb . Perfect location as well, 3 minute walk from beach, but very quiet at night. I would'nt stay anywhere else, if I were to go back.Thank-you Paul, Felix, Erik and rest of staff !!"
50,Tabachin del Puerto ! What a great vacation treat. Greeted by Don Pablo/ Paul Clever interesting conversations while dining on fantastic Mexican meals. Absolutely the most relaxing vacation ever! A very special place. Terry Waldron USA
40,"Paul Cleaver knows how to make one feel welcome to Puerto Escondido.  The room was comfortable and inviting.  The breakfast --especially the coffee--was first-rate.  The service was very attentive.  And the conversation with Don Pablo over breakfast was interesting. Overall, a most excellent visit.  Very convenient location.  Very attentive staff.  I would definitely return.  And the price definitely was right."
40,"Tabachín is in a great spot right between Zicatela and Marinero beaches. The rooms are eclectically decorated with tons of character, very clean and with blessed, blessed A/C (you'll want it). The owner Paul, from the US, is a class act with a really interesting background, a passion for literature (lots of good books in the rooms), and a habit of eating breakfast with you in the outdoor courtyard, chatting and giving good travel advice. Breakfast is included in the price of the room. Try the homemade oatmeal or the huitlacoche (traditional indigenous mushroom) omelet."
50,"I highly recommend staying at el Tabachin. It is, simply, the best travel experience I have ever had! The apartment I stayed in was very big and airy, with a refreshing sea breeze and amazing views from the big, wrap-around balcony. It was perfectly clean and nicely decorated.   Paul, the owner, and his extremely charasmatic host, Felix,  make you immediately at home and the breakfasts are truly the best I have ever had in Puerto Escondido!  If you have trouble sleeping in hotels, something which often is the case for me, this is the place for you! I have never slept better, not even in my own house. The relaxing  sound of the waves blocked out all other noise and soon I was fast asleep.  As for the location, it couldn't be better, right where Playa Marinero meets with Zicatela."
40,"I spent a delightful week at Tabachin. I have been travelling alone for several months in Mexico and it is important to me to feel secure. Tabachin offers comforts of home, security, and fabulous breakfasts. The room was spotlessly clean, comfortable and delightfully decorated, with a small kitchen and balcony. The air conditioning was especially welcome as it can be quite warm in Puerto Escondido during the day. Paul, the owner, was knowledgeable and helpful about Puerto Escondido, and I felt that he was concerned that I was comfortable and secure. The staff were friendly and helpful as well. I would definitely go back."
50,"Hotel Tabachin is off the beaten path, but was one of the most delightful experiences I had in nearly four months traveling in Mexico.  Paul, the owner is instantly warm and welcoming, you feel like you're coming home to family instead of checking into a bed and breakfast.  Paul took the time to help me get settled in, even taking me to the bank and orienting me to the town.  All the reviews I read about Hotel Tabachin praised the breakfast part as being very good; however I would actually rate it as outstanding.  Paul has his very own coffee operation, and makes his own bread.  Such care and attention to the food also extends to the rooms and the guests.  The rooms are impeccably clean and very tastefully decorated, making it seem like a home.  For the price, I felt as if I got"
50,"Great service, great staff, beautiful suites and garden / pool. Location is perfect for surfers wanting to surf La Punta and other spots in the area. Zicatela a 2,5 km beach walk or 5 minute ride away."
50,We loved this beautiful small resort. It is pet friendly and had a beautiful pool and restarant and bar onsite. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We made some good friends there and hope to go back one day. We were able to walk to the beach and into town for dinner at many great restaurants. 
50,"My friend and I are obsessed with this place. We were remotely and after trying 2 different Airbnb’s, this place was our saving grace. They probably have the strongest and most reliable internet connection in the area. The owner and his son were so friendly and hospitable. We loved the pool and free yoga. We will definitely be returning in the future and really recommend staying here!"
50,"This is a hidden gem. Love this place and intend to keep coming back.  If you are looking for All-Inclusive, you’re in the wrong place.. But if you are looking for cozy, quaint, and safe . . . This place place is perfect. More like adventurous living while getting the local heritage. 2-3 blocks from the beach. Incredible surf. Warm water. Many stores and restaurants within walking distance. The atmosphere of Casamar is incredible and you will fall in love with Puerto Escondido."
50,"Couldn't say enough great things about Casamar. Ted was extremely gracious throughout our time. Each staff member was very helpful.  We were in town for a wedding and needed to stay somewhere for a night before our travel brought us elsewhere.  During Jan and Feb, there seems to be a lot of the same people that come back every year. Very friendly guests. One in particular (Mike, Canadian) drove my friend and I to our next destination without even asking. Another friend in their group offered us some Mezcal. Other guests gave us great insight on checking out the Punta and which restaurants to go to. I will be back."
50,"We loved our stay at this oasis. The staff are beautiful and the feeling of the place is like a little community. It was perfect for our 3weeks in Puerto. Great to be located in La Punta which is very low key and chill too.  The kids loved the movie night they put on once a week for guests.  They also have a meet & greet dinner once a week for everyone staying there to meet each other and share a beautiful home cooked meal together...this is rare find nowadays a hotel/ aparthotel that cares to invest in creating Community amongst guests. A generous initiative. I can see why many guests come back to enjoy this place yearly.  Loved the chlorine free pool, so nice to be swimming without all those chemicals.   Also great to have the on-site kitchen dishing up lovely home cooked food"
50,"My wife and I spent a week at Casamar, staying in the Sirena suite. It was a great stay. Our suite was very large and comfortable. The staff at Casamar was excellent. Easy walking distance to many fine restaurants in La Putna. Easy access by taxi to the the many fine beaches in the area. We wish it could have been a longer stay."
50,"Wonderful place, great location, awesome people. The food is great.  The pool was excellent.  Room service is amazing.  My wife and I celebrated our 6th Anniversary of marriage and everything was perfect.  "
50,"This apartment complex is fantastic. We stayed a week at this beautiful complex relaxing, swimming in the lovely pool and walking the nearby beach. The owner Will and his staff made our stay a real pleasure. The weekly meet and greet dinner was a great idea and while we did not attend there is also a movie night too. Having a kitchen with a good supply of utensils was great but also the in-house cafe for breakfast and lunch was excellent too. The extensive library was really great and very much appreciated for relaxing with book on the multiple hammocks on the private balconies and the beautiful garden area. We will definitely recommend this place to our friends and family."
50,"After an Air BnB fell through, my husband and small dog were looking for a place for one night. Google Maps told us Casamar was down the street, so we headed over. The outside didn't look like much, and we had to ring a hard-to-find doorbell to get let in and speak to the front desk staff. But once inside the gate, it was so cute!! Justine, the reception person, welcomed us and showed us to the front office area, where she helped us secure a room for the night. They even honored a lower online rate that I found when I showed it to her on my phone. While I sorted out the payment with her, my husband was able to pull into a secure, gated parking area just on the other side of our room. She walked us through the courtyard past a pool that was surprisingly clean with all of the"
50,Really cool and relaxed hostel! Staff are great (especially Erick and Rosalee and Chloe) and pool is such a bonus. Met lots of lovely people here and would definitely recommend! Great value for money. 
30,I've stayed in quite a few party hostels so generally know what's in store. However most of the others I've stayed in try to give guests who want or need time out a chance to do so. When I arrived at Tower Bridge I wasn't feeling well after a 13 hour bus ride and being down with a bug. In the evening I tried to turn in for an early night as I just wasn't up for drinking and fun. The problem I personally found was that this hostel wasn't set up to allow people to have a quiet night if they wanted to. I was allocated a bunk in the men's dorm which seemed to have as many female guests as men. No problem with that. The problems I did experience were to do with aspects of the dorm itself. The dorm was split into 2 sections. The first section had a light in the ceiling. The section I
50,"This place was great for meeting people and socializing! Has a cool little bar, awesome pool and the staff are so friendly and helpful!! I would definitely stay here again. Also the wifi is really good! "
50,"The best part is th e big pool, I know few cheap hostels with a clean and big pool. The owners are a German couple, super cool people and easy going, the bar of the hostel is nice and they give promotions some days, drinks are well served and super cheap. The atmosphere in general is friendly and chill. The room I was in was a private one, it was very clean, didn't have air contidioning but with two fans was enough."
50,"Had an awesome here. The hostel was clean, staff was friendly and it was a great / relaxed atmosphere in the hostel. It is located close to two nice beaches but not very close to Zicatela or Playa Principal (keep that in mind!). It has a great and clean pool, which is surrounded of palm trees. Great! Bar is open from 6 pm everyday and the happy hour is from 6-8. Breakfast is not included, but you can have a good one for just 50 pesos. Value for the money is great! The owners Erik and Inge are great person, very helpful and friendly. I can highly recommend this place and will come back one day!"
50,"I was first at tower bridge in February, immediately upon entering you got a sense of welcoming and friendship all over. A great place to meet friendly staff and guests from all over the world. The place is literally built to bring people together with a central pool and bar that opens daily from 6-12. Theres no need to ever leave this place. I was here for a short 5 days and loved it so much that I had to come back this time in march, and stayed for an entire month. Great accommodation, pricing,and amenities. Although a 15 minute walk from the beach, its a great location next to playa  carizalillo, coral, and bacocho where they do daily release of turtles at 1700 from nov to may. Although my time here has come to an end for the second time I can guarantee ill be back very soon."
40,"First things first, the owners Inge and Eric from Germany are both great people! You can tell they really love their hostel and are putting forth a lot of effort to make it better each and every day! The pool is amazing. Best pool in a hostel that I have seen in months! They have a bar in the hostel, which means that no ""outside alcohol"" is allowed from 6pm to bar close. The drinks at the bar, however are relatively cheap and range from 20-40 pesos! Breakfast is not included, but they do offer it for 40 pesos. I'm an extreme budget traveler, so I never ate the breakfast, but others seemed to enjoy it! The dorm rooms are pretty clean, the bathrooms could use a little more cleaning/maintenance, but overall I really enjoyed my stay here!"
30,"We stayed for four nights at Tower Bridge and by the end I was pleased to be leaving! The hostel itself is well thought out with a nice bar, pool and a definite party vibe, but the rooms and service in my opinion weren't so thought out. The room was very basic, which for the price you can't complain - but the bin wasn't emptied out the whole time of our stay. This wouldn't usually bother me at all but when you're using it to put toilet paper in and it's hot...it's another story!! The bed was also not great and the sheets had holes in. That being said the hostel is very close to a great beach - one of the smaller, quieter ones, and the nearby restaurant was great. I think this would suit singles and party goers who don't like to sleep but for us it wasn't ideal! "
50,"I slept great in the dorms, and had a great time every night. Lots of the facilities, like the beds and bar are new, The staff are so friendly, especially Dave, Inga, and Erik. I would happily stay there again. I like the breakfast, which started early, and lasted most of the day. The pool was great, and there was a ton of space to relax."
50,"I spent one night in this hostel and liked it a lot. The staff was super nice, friendly and helpful with everything I asked for! It was clean and the owner Eric is a cool guy. This hostel has a great atmosphere and the staff cares for their guests in any possible way! Thanks for a great stay!  "
50,"I stayed here for 2 weeks whilst taking part in a yoga teacher training. I would highly reccomend this hotel for the following reasons:  1. The staff - they are incredibly kind and hardworking, really going above and beyond to make sure we had a fantastic stay.  2. The location - the hotel is located very near the centre of the La Punta area, with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants to choose from.  3. The hotel itself - the facilities such as the rooms (especially in the newer part of the hotel) fitness studio, pool and restaurant were all well maintained and great to use.  Overall, I really couldn’t fault my experience here. The hotel is beautiful but what really makes it are the wonderful, kind staff who made it feel like a home away from home."
50,"We stayed here about 12 nights, got to know the staff. Josmar, Ray, Karen and Oliver will take care of you - any tours, questions, requests they will help you 100%. Lots of options offered here and good pricing.  Next, Maria and the daytime ladies are so wonderful, they make breakfast time feel like home. Good, healthy options, we very much enjoyed it. The cleaning staff are friendly, very efficient and clean. This property does aim to be eco friendly which we appreciate. Moni's signature cocktails are wonderful, she is a true mixologist. Food and drinks at the hotel are wonderful, makes it hard to leave the place since everything is there. Wonderful place to stay, after awhile the staff seem like your friends. Will absolutely stay here again!"
50,"We’ve stayed the last 3 nights of our 2 weeks holiday in Puerto Escondido at Casa De Olas and it was a great end of our trip. Casa De Olas was recommended to us by a friend and exceeded our expectations. It’s a small boutique hotel very close to the beach and behind the main street of la Punta. It’s located close to all the hustle and bustle, but very quiet. It has a cute and beautiful little swimming pool and a yoga studio with great views. I did a few gym and yoga classes and the teachers Charlotte and Pablo were amazing. The rest of the staff is super friendly and helpful too, especially Josmar at reception. It’s a clean, beautiful hotel and it looks even better than the pics. We will definitely come back to Puerto Escondido and will stay here again. Thanks very much Norma &"
50,"10/10 The atmosphere is very relaxed, the staff is extremely friendly and willing to help in any request.  we booked a number of tours through the hotel which were all good. The pool is refreshing for the warm temperatures in puerto Escondido, as are the clean rooms with air conditioning and fan.  I can certainly recommend it."
50,"It's most beautiful place on the puerto escondido.  We have had a yoga retreat and I must say it was the best choice so far. All people who works there was very helpful, friendly and faboulous. Very close to the beach, rooms cleaned on the daily basis and food just wow! We loved the service and definitely come back!!! The hotel team can organise trips to see around or explore Mexican nature! Thank you for being incredibly cool 😎 ♥️"
50,"After two years of covid what an amazing trip away to beautiful Puerto Escondido. Casa De Olas boutique hotel was absolutely incredible, from the food to accommodations it was a and amazing experience! A close and beautiful walk to many local restaurants and a beautiful beach that you have to catch the sunset from. Absolutely breath taking!  We can’t wait to visit this beautiful hotel again in our future travels."
50,"Leaving Puerto Escondido today and can’t believe the exceptional time we just had at the most incredible boutique hotel, Casa de Olas. From the moment we got in to the day we left, the service was exceptional. We felt so special, so tended to, there is no doubt we’ll be back. The owner Matt and his parents were such a joy to meet and made sure we had everything we needed. Efraim the general manager was so kind. Meeting Monica, the most amazing bartender, was one of the highlights of our trip! Her drinks and generosity were unmatched! The kindness and thoughtfulness was felt in every way. Mimi, Raquel, Javier, Josmar, Oliver were just a few of the staff we were lucky enough to meet. They greeted us with so much joy every single time. Erika the massage therapist was unbelievable"
50,"I spent my second Christmas with the Casa De Olas family and it was even more perfect than the first time!  New additions to the hotel, rooms, staff and amenities continually make this place the most incredible boutique hotel experience I have ever had.   Staff at set up multiple excursions/activities for us that went seamlessly! We did fishing, whale watching, Laguna Manialtepec and a surf trip. Highly recommend any of these!  The new spa is incredibly clean and peaceful, can not recommend their massages enough.   There is a new breakfast menu that is to die for! Do not skip the smoothies and chilaquiles verde! The lunch and dinner menu had a great variety of items, our groups favourites were the lasagna, quesadillas and the hamburger.   We tried multiple different fitness"
50,"Adamo, Moni & Char became like family. We spent half our evenings at the hotel grounds enjoying Adamo's wonderful cooking & hanging out at the hotel bar/pool with Moni. Due to our own schedule we were not able to attend Char's yoga classes but she still said hi and had a wonderful evening with us with Adamo's Italian cooking and Moni's cocktails. Char even gave impromptu yoga pointers which were very much appreciated. The rest of the staff were quite friendly as well. The location is perfect, it's a walking distance to the bars but not too close to be bothered by the noise and revelry at night. A very safe, quiet & accessible location. We hope to visit them again soon! Wished we stayed longer because 7 nights were not enough."
50,"6 of us came here and it was such a incredible time. The food was SO GOOD, everything on the menu was delicious, the staff were so friendly and helpful. We went on a tour and it was such a awesome experience. Lots of restaurants near by but we ate at the hotel most nights because the food was so good. Also there is a beautiful tennis court next door. Workout classes, pool, the place has it all. Definitely will be returning!!"
50,"We loved it here. Wonderful breakfasts from Magdalena. A super pool to swim in, shade and sun.  The beds are comfortable and linen fresh. Atalina the host even brews her own special Beer: hefeweizen , pale ale etc. These were delicious. If you are looking for a place to relax, recharge and enjoy look no further."
50,"Quinta Lili is a really beautiful place. Clean, calm, relaxing, spacious. Walking distance to the great natural beaches only a few minutes. Adelina and Magda made a really great job, the breakfast was unbelievable!! We loved staying at this lovely place!!"
50,The perfect get away!  Within walking distance of two great little beaches on the north side of town and a quick 10 min taxi to Bahia Pricipal and some of the best surfing in Mexico.  The master suite is perfect with beautiful breezes through the night and morning.  The owners and staff are amazing and will bend over backwards to make your stay as perfect as possible.  I would return here in a second!!!
50,"Located in a quiet street in the immediate vicinity of one of Escondidos most beautiful and natural beaches. At the same time only 2 minutes away from a boulevard with plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants. No party location though. That can be found in the lively center around the marina (2-3km away, Taxi at 25 Pesos) as well as along famous surf beach Playa Zicatela. Beautiful house and pool with open air bar and lounge area. Rooms clean, cozy and well equiped. Owners and staff super nice and tremendously helpful with tips and recommendations. Best craft beer in southern Mexico brewed by the owners!  :)"
50,"Beautiful, clean, spacious, w/ nice views. Great, if not, ""amazing"" breakfasts.  Adelina (right spelling?) and Magdelina (again, spelling ??) are two of the most wonderful people you could ever meet.   Highly recommended."
50,"Planned as a 5 day stay, we quickly extended by three more nights - but that was only because we couldn't stay any longer, otherwise we would have! We booked the awesome room at the top of the house with a fabulous view and a wonderful breeze that comes in straight from the Ocean. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable and the breakfast was the only thing able to get us up and out in the mornings... oh but it was worth it: every day we were surprised with some new and wonderful mexican delight prepared and served straight to our plates, along with fresh seasonal fruit and muesli. Just a short walk to the prettiest beach in the area, so close to the restaurants and mini-mart and still so very quiet! Thanks to Adelina, Magda and the Team at Quinta Lili we had a truely"
50,"My husband and I stayed 12 nights in this beautiful place.  We loved every minute.  It was our 3rd time to Puerto and our first time staying outside of a condo rental.  Adelina and Magda made our stay feel like we were guests in someone's home. An added bonus was Adeline's baby who we saw almost every day and who made us all smile. The breakfasts were really fantastic and each of the 12 mornings we had a different delicious Mexican dish. Magda, the woman to takes care of most everything at Quinta Lili is kind and helpful and just so lovely.  The Master suite was beautiful and airy and the bed was extremely comfortable.  We would return in a heartbeat.  There is nothing negative to say about this fabulous place."
50,"We stayed at Quinta Lili in February of 2016. Adeline and Magda made our visit very special. Adelina the owner was a wealth of knowledge on all things local, she provided us with recommendations for excursions and restaurants which were the highlights of our trip. Magda, the housekeeper and cook, was very attentive, anticipating our needs and likes. The hotel is clean and comfortable and located in a quiet neighbourhood just a 5 minute walk to our favourite beach, Playa  Carrizalillo. We are already planning our return. Thank you Adelina Kathy B"
50,"We found Quinta Lili through Tripadvisor, and we are so grateful  that we did. The house is so nice. We slept in two different rooms, both of them were amazing. Our hostess, Adelina, was very helpful and sweet, and she and her staff served a great breakfast every morning. I would definitely recommend this quite, little, wonderful place."
50,"We really enjoyed our time at Quinta Lili. It was excellent in all aspects. The hospitality was second to none. Adelina was like a personal concierge with lots of great information on where to eat and go for the best Mescal cocktail ever!! Magdelina cooked us an awesome breakfast every morning. One must try the craft beer they make as well, Biercito. The rooms were very clean and the lack of air conditioning was not an issue at all; the breeze through the windows and ceiling fan kept the room very comfortable. The location was great, walking distance to a number of beautiful beaches and many restaurants. All in all it had the most relaxing vibe and is a very special place. We would love to go back."
40,"Two couples. We had the largest room. What a view! The Carrizalillo cove. Watching surfers and turtles- quite cool. We were in the colorada room. Large adequately appointed.  The only drawback was the restaurant upstairs. No party noises or clinking glasses, but every once in a while it sounded like we had a bowling alley upstairs. Not to worry, they closed by 10  Oh, hot water was a challenge.   Would definitely recommend!"
50,"Was very glad we paid a bit extra for a room with an ocean view (Escondido) as the view was amazing. This is a lovely hotel - great restaurant, warm staff and it sits right atop the best beach for miles. The room was huge and well appointed. There are also some lovely shops and restaurants within a five minute walk."
50,"It's a perfect place to end our Mexican Getaway! We started in Mexico City for a bit of art & history; then headed to Oaxaca City for food & nature tours and beautiful typical handicraft shopping at its market and finally got to villas Carrizalillo for total relaxation !! Our Villa Colorado features a gorgeous view... a kitchenette, a balcony perching on top of junglelike tree top with a infinite 180 degree sweeping view of ocean + the Carrizalillo bay & beach... it's a picture perfect for relaxing ...for reinvigorating... for renewing ...  Waking up every morning to the chirping of the birds and the crushing of the ocean below were pure divine...and having our morning coffee with pan dulce... fruits and juice was a wonderful way to start your lazy day... (we stocked up for our"
50,"It is a really wonderful hotel! The beach is small but you can swim or surf - as you read before, you have to climb up some stairs.  Puerto Escondido is about a 25min walk away- so if you like to go out for night, you have to take a cab. But if your just like to relax on the beach and go out for dinner at night, there a several options near the hotel.  We really enjoyed our stay!"
50,"We enjoyed a leisurely 18 night stay here in January, giving us an excellent opportunity to get to know this superior hotel from every angle.  We enjoyed the outstanding location and the warm welcome received during this stay (our second) at Villas Carrizalillo.    Every request we made was graciously accommodated:  help with arranging an early morning Lalo birding tour, immediate attention to a maintenance issue, and help with directions and local information.   We loved our stay in two of the waterfront villas - both were outstanding.  Previously we enjoyed staying in Villa Londres which, although not directly on the water, is spacious and perfect for a holiday with family.   Most units have kitchens, but it is a luxury to also have the Espadin restaurant on site for a drink"
50,"Just had the hands down best vacation of my life here! It also helped that I married the most wonderful partner while there with 50 of my closest friends to help celebrate. The staff all went out of their way to make us feel welcome and took care of any needs while not making anything too fussy. I slept in four different villas while there and although I have a favorite, there is not a bad room/villa at the resort. Being able to have our kids take their first surf lessons just down the stairs from Villas Carrizalillo in a safe beginner surf break while I headed to Zicatela was awesome. The staff helped us set up fishing, spear fishing, dolphin tours, and bioluminescent lagoon swims while there with incredible local guides they know and trust. Safety was never a concern! Then"
50,"The hotel is located in a panoramic hill overviewing Carrizalillo Beach, the most beautiful beach for me in Puerto Escondido because, besides the great beauty, you can both swim and surf. The hotel is a compound of little villas/suites. Most of them have this beautiful view. The restaurant Espadin, inside the property, is a great restaurant and his beautiful position makes of it one of the most beautiful places in town."
50,"Wonderful place, not luxury but very good and peaceful. Restaurant is fairly good and its view its outstanding. For world class food walk ten minutes to Amoraduz restaurant, best restaurant in Mexico..."
50,"This place is awesome.  Not fancy but spacious, clean, comfortable beds and a killer location.  The view is amazing as is the hill top location.  Maya who is running the front desk is incredibly nice and helpful.  Whatever you need.  If you are a surfing family this spot is particularly great. The beach right below is great for beginners.  There are steps down. The hotel has five or six surf boards you can use. A bit worn but perfectly good.  I went and bought a new leash.  You can also rent boards on the beach for 100 pesos.  The restaurant is super good.  There have been some complaints on this site about the service at the restaurant.  We didn’t experience it.  Magdalena was particularly great.  And you will be happy when you get the bill.  Quite reasonable all things"
50,"We stayed here in October 2017 with my wife and son. The room was great and the food at the hotel was excellent. Down a flight of steep stairs is a beautiful small intimate beach where you can have a drink, learn to surf, or just swim around. "
50,"I flew in on a Monday for 3 days of lessons and left on a Friday afternoon. All 5 instructors aim to please and will bend over backwards to get you up on the board and help you find whatever it is you want when you are not in the water. They even take pictures for you. The other people visiting were very laid back and friendly just like this part of the beach.   The house has 5 rooms with private bathrooms. There is no air conditioning, like most of Mexico, but even on the hottest days it was comfortable with the high-powered fan on the ceiling.  There are plenty of places to eat seafood just about right outside the door and the beach is indeed very near. It was very clean. The yard is kept nice and there are hammocks to laze about and tables and chairs to eat, snack, drink and"
50,Me and my partner stayed with David at the surf house for a week and took classes everyday just about!! The house and rooms were amazing and with his awesome crew I recone they could teach anyone to surf!! Freda the dog was also a star if you take her down the beach she will also take you on her own adventures :) we will defiantly be back thankyou so much guys I couldn't fault you!!!
50,"i took surflessons for one week and stayed at davids nice place. with the help of these guys almoast everyone can surf. they pushed me in the best waves, took photos and so on. the house is great. beautiful and good located at la punta zicatela. i can highly recommend this place!"
50,"I stayed one week at David's house more or less, and took 8 classes. The house and rooms are great, very comfortable for a very good price. I had a lot of fun with all the instructors, I absolutely recommend this place for learning to surf and stay. Not far from center of Zicatela or Puerto Escondido by taxi or colectivo."
50,"I loved David and Swan's house in Puerto. They have created a wonderful environment for surfers and anyone interested in learning how to surf.  Accommodations: Clean filtered water provided every day in the kitchen, small fridge, mosquito nets over beds, laziness inducing hammocks, ceiling fans (no air conditioning, but the cool ocean is steps away), a few clean towels provided, toilet paper provided, no hot showers but you won't need it, Wifi available (a bit slow, but sufficient for work e-mail).  Surf Lessons: David and his team are wonderful. I've taken 6 surf trips and had 3 different surf instructors thus far. David and his team were the best. Very patient and focused on helping you make incremental improvements. I was much better at surfing by the end of the week. "
50,"Stayed here with girlfriend for a week, and a few other friends for part of the trip. We had a great time, Swantje and David are very nice hosts. The hotel is very relaxed. Only 5 rooms so never too many people around, but it's close enough to restaurants and bars that you'll be happy.  We were here mostly for surfing. I already surf, so was mostly out at La Punta. Girlfriend got surf lessons from David and loved it."
50,"I think this is the best place to stay in the Puerto Escondido area.   Super friendly people, quiet area and 50m from the beach surfing beach, small shops and restaurants nearby. Would definitely return without hestitation :-)."
50,"I honestly cannot recommend this place enough!!  We initially booked 5 days here and ended up staying 10.  The house itself is a great find and definitely the nicest place to stay in la punta, about 30 sec walk to the beach.   There is a lot of attention to detail and the grounds and gardens are a great place to relax. Security is also excellent, the owners David and Swantje and their family live upstairs so it has a great homely feel while still having plenty of privacy. They make you feel so welcome and there is a well equipped communal kitchen.  Surf lessons are great. David and his team clearly have loads of teaching experience and made us feel completely comfortable in the water. They are also just a nice bunch of guys and we always had a lot of fun. I was a total beginner"
50,"Puerto Escondido is one of the chillest places on earth, and Puerto Surf house is a perfect place to stay.  The owners make you feel like you're at home, they're extremely friendly and laid back.  The hotel is a few steps from the beach, the rooms are very comfortable and clean, and the garden is beautiful.  Definitely plan to return soon!"
50,"I have visited this place for a long weekend, and it was my first in Puerto. Owners are great, friendly and relax, surf teachers are really professional, nice equipment for rent also. Rooms are pretty clean simple and nice. Only missing a swimming pool ;-) Will definitely come back"
50,"Great location, next to ATM and mini market, 10 min walk from el Adoquin street and main beach area. The hotel has many artistic details, rooms are clean and comfy. Very good staff service and reasonably price food. The pool and hammock area is great. We found a quiet atmosphere and our expectations were met. "
10,"After finding out I'm pregnant and having to cancel my Mexico vacation due to zika, I contacted this hotel to request a cancellation. I booked through booking.com and even though my credit card had not yet been charged, the hotel told me it was ""impossible"" and immediately charged my card. According to booking.com, all reservations can be cancelled without penalty as long as your credit card has not yet been charged. Knowing this, the hotel immediately charged me upon hearing I needed to cancel. In my view, this is bordering on fraudulent. Under the circumstances, I was able to cancel most of my multi-city Mexico trip without problem. This hotel was the only one that refused to be reasonable."
50,"I couldn't ask for more from my stay. We had the master suite with a small pool on the patio, and it was amazing. The view was great, the separate kitchen came in very handy, and the service from the staff was always amazing.   The grounds are spread out and very cool, and the main pool is very nice. The hotel is located just steps from the main strip in town, just down the stairs from an Oxxo, and a quick taxi ride from Zicatela. Despite the town feeling very safe, they do lock the hotel gate at night if you're worried about security.  My only small issue was that the wifi was weak in our room because we were on the top floor and well away from the lobby, but it was a minor inconvenience at best.  We had a great visit and I will 100% stay here again when I return to Puerto"
40,"The rooms were very clean, it is conveniently located near restaurants, craft shops and the main bay. The staff was super friendly and very helpful. We got a room with ocean view and it was beautiful.  The architecture of the hotel is rustic and very beautiful but the problme is there are not elevators or ramps."
40,"Because of a strike we were stranded in Puerto Escondido, and had to find a hotel on very short notice. We ended up at Paraiso, which turned out to be a good pick.   Now of course, there are worst places to be stranded than Puerto Escondido. Paraiso is located in the old town, which was built in the 1970s. Because of the off-season we got a really good rate, and we had the place almost to ourselves. Owner Sergio went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant, and he helped us a lot in planning our further journey--which was complicated because of the striking.   The hotel itself features 1970 architecture, a little quirky, which is what we like. We had a standard double room, luckily with AC. The room was spacious enough, and the bed was decent. Some renovation may be opportune"
40,"Rooms were clean as well as pool, staff very helpful. As we travel with a baby girl it was complicated the lack of restaurant or kitchen inside the hotel. Not recommended for resting as you need to go out every time you are hungry. The walk from the main avenue called Los Adoquines is pretty dark at night. "
50,"I live in Mexico and have been to Puerto many times in the past few years. I have never had much luck finding a nice hotel until I recently stayed here with my family who were visiting from England. This hotel is in the best location in Puerto Escondido! Very close to the town, bank, supermarket and a short walk to the best beaches. Sergio, the owner, went out of his way to make sure we had the best time possible. Very friendly and helpful. Rooms were very nice! We stayed in the suite for 1 night too which I definitely recommend. The small dipping pool on the balcony and a private kitchen/dining area was amazing. Overall an excellent place to stay. Perfect for families, couples or friends. I will definitely be staying here next time I visit Puerto! Thanks Sergio"
40,"I enjoyed my time at the Paraiso Escondido,Sergio is a can do manager and Ida at reception was most pleasant and helpful.My suite on the top floor was very comfortable albeit simply furnished.The wi-fi worked perfectly well and I used the small kitchen at the end of the hall to make my daily coffee.The pool was absolutely delightful and much appreciated in the extremely warm weather.The access to food options and the beach was convenient."
40,"Stayed here for 2 nights, and must say first impression was rustic! The pool was good. You have to be able to walk well, as it's a bit on a hill side, lots of stairs, no elevator. We were on the 2nd floor and still had  a view. Air conditioning worked well. I wish there would have been a mini fridge in the room or at least an ice machine on the premises. The rooms had no tv, but did have a little balcony! It's within walking distance to the beach."
50,"Hotel Paraiso Escondido is an awesome place to stay!  We stayed in the master suite, with amazing views out over the beaches from the spacious terrace, and it's own private pool and kitchen. We loved having our very own private penthouse apartment that had so much character and so much space!  Sergio is extremely helpful and gave us some fabulous tips on where to go and what to do.  The service he provided was absolutely outstanding, genuine and friendly.  Puerto Escondido was definitely the highlight of our trip to Mexico, due to the awesome accommodation and outstanding service we enjoyed at Hotel Paraiso Escondido."
20,"We reserved the cheapest room that VillaSol had so I was expecting a view that was not very good and possibly noisy and was willing to put up with that.  But the room itself was quite pleasant and colorful.  The view was as expected.  The A/C was new and worked very well.  There was no soap of any kind when we arrived and from then on there was always something missing.  Towels one day, bath mat the next.  If you wanted to call the front desk with the phone in the room...nope.  Didn't work.  So if you wanted any of these items or report a problem you had to hike all the way  to the front  desk to get them.  The faucet in the bathroom leaked so that any toiletry  items, meds or cosmetics  left there were soaked.  The toilet stopped working twice.  I left my wallet in the airport"
40,"My family and I visited Puerto Escondido in April and stayed at Hotel Suites Villasol. We enjoyed our stay, the rooms were very clean, air conditioner worked fine, pool area always clean. We had breakfast and diner at the restaurant in the hotel and the food was delicious and reasonably priced. What we MOST enjoyed was the Beach Club! Right on the beach, it was  incredible. Great views of the ocean, great service at the pool side bar. We were lucky enough to release baby turtles. BEST UNFORGETABLE EXPERIENCE. We very much enjoyed our stay at Hotel Suites Villasol."
20,"Staff is nice and friendly. The hotel and rooms are ok...just ok.  However, this hotel is overpriced for what you receive.  Also, the Beach Club could be good, but it is poorly staffed. The staff that is there does not work hard, and are rude. They laugh together like they have their own little exclusive Club. I brought a bunch of tip money with me, but it stayed in my pocket.  We waited 45 minutes for drinks to be served AND THEY WERE VERY WEAK DRINKS. It was strange, because they were very slow at the time.  We switched to Mojitos and they were awful (and weak). I've been to Mexico over thirty times and have never experienced such bad drinks and service.  They charge a lot of money for their drinks too.  The Wifi never worked.  Not worth it.  We won't go back there."
30,"The Good:  they have a lovely beach resort 10mins walk from the hotel (or use free shuttle).   Rooms are large. Staff are very friendly. Very close to the airport.  The bad:  very dated property that needs refurbishment. AC doesn’t work that well. Shower is small and old.  Food is ok but not great. Service is not great, slow, and they seem disorganised all the time.   My next trip I would stay at Posada Real (next door), seems much better!!!!"
20,"I spent 3 nights here and there were some good parts, bad parts and ugly parts:  The good: The beach club that is included with this resort is beautiful and has great service. The swimming pool onsite is also nice, as is the food at the hotel restaurant.   The bad: When we arrived on Friday afternoon, they stuck us in a back corner room with a view of street construction, a phone that didn't work, a broken air conditioner (which is vital), stained furniture and a restroom without towels or shampoo. When we complained to the front desk the women that worked there were extremely rude and disregarded everything we told them. We had to speak to two other people before finally getting a better room.  The ugly: There is no WiFi in the rooms, and the WiFi that is supposed to work in"
30,"Good family hotel for Puerto Escondido Standards. Never forget it is 3 stars so don't expect premium service. It has hot water, rooms are clean and food is very good for a 3 star hotel. The beach club is great and has a delicious restaurant. Very close to the airport. Take taxis outside the airport (35 pesos) vs. taxis inside (250 pesos). Puerto Escondido is a surf spot so the beach is not an option for kids."
50,"For the second year, we enjoyed and relaxed at the Villasol Beach Club (Club de Playa Villasol) Purchasing a very reasonable membership (we rent a bungalow on Zicatela Beach), we took advantages of the beautiful facilities several times a week from January-March.  From the Managers to the pool waiters, the chefs and the receptionists, we encountered friendly, personable and professional service. The pools and swim up bar are always pristine, and the new bathroom facilities are both comfortable and hygienic. The food and drinks are outstanding! Of course, we love Happy Hour. And the view of the beach and ocean is fabulous. The only thing that was not wonderful were the lounges beside the pool, which have been stretched beyond comfort. Hopefully we will see new and improved ones"
30,"Staying in a condo in town, we didn't have access to a beach directly, so we decided to try the beach club here. It was quick taxi ride, to arrive at the beautiful resort grounds. We arrived early and were able to get a couple lounge chairs by the pool. There is obviously a lot of people playing the towel game here, because almost every one was already taken. As we settled in for the day, an older couple came beside us to their toweled loungers. They obviously don't like the day users of the beach club, since we were immediately called interlopers, and they spoke to others around us as if we were deaf to their comments. Now day users do pay for the use of the loungers, 100 pesos each per day. We tried the pool only to cool off since the ocean was very rough, but the pool was"
50,"Worth the splurge when visiting Puerto Escondido! This secluded adults-only, beachfront resort was the perfect girls trip to escape NY winter and to treat ourselves after a year of pandemic blues.  The resort is part of the Casa Wabi Foundation — peacefully located away from the hustle and bustle of Puerto Escondido, it’s the perfect hideaway to social distance and relax.  There are only 16 luxury, thatched-roofed bungalows on the property.  All have a private plunge pool and extensive patio just steps away from the beach —we practically stayed in our bungalow the entire day.    The room itself was comfortable and rustic-chic with thoughtful luxury amenities like beach bags, sun hats, and natural bug spray.  We especially loved sleeping to the sounds of the waves.  Both sunrise"
40,"I booked King rooms with balcony, but was not granted with it. It is not like I booked the rooms a week before, but I booked it at least 4 months prior to our arrival date. However, the rooms that we got was not bad. Comfy bed - 7/10, clean rooms - 7/10,  clean bathroom - 6/10. I guess to sum it all up, the rooms are perfect after a long day spending in the beach. So it was not that bad at all. Breakfast is included, BUT only selected ones. Breakfast would be 5/10.  The best part of staying in this hotel is their amenities. They have a club house right next to the beach with a pool bar (shuttle are available, probably 10th of a mile away from the hotel). Clean, yes. Drinks are OK. Food is JUST OK.   But overall, I enjoyed my stay here. Beach, sun and sand makes me happy and"
40,"This is our first trip to Mexico. Puerto Escondido is such a beautiful are, with something for everyone. The hotel itself is very clean, and the staff are wonderful. There is a beautiful pool in the center court, and another pool down at the ocean edge with an amazing beach(this has a shuttle that will take you back and forth from 10 am. to 6 p.m.. Watch out for the surf there, it can be tricky. There is food offered at both the on site location and the remote location, but service is not very fast.  We learned the quirks and worked around them, so that was okay. Our room is in the older part of the hotel, bottom floor because my husband has difficulty with too many stairs. These rooms are very plain, and without much storage. A small hanging rack and three small drawers.  There"
50,"Hotel Escondido is an amazing secluded property perfect for disconnecting from real life. The best part is the unique setting, in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by mountains, jungle, and the pacific ocean. It's breathtaking and relaxing.   Bungalows are perfect, combining nature with barefoot luxury. Rooms open both towards the mountains and the ocean, making it a unique setting. All rooms feature a private plunge pool and direct beach access.  Service was consistently good and low key, fitting the location. Food and drinks were delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed all meals, including a diner at Kakurega, the hotel's omakase."
10,"We were very disappointed with the Hotel manager response to our Kakurega dinner cancelation claim. Even we booked one night at the Escondido Hotel, they cancelled us the dinner via email 3 hrs before, because we did not filled a pdf that was sent on an email 3 days before. So, be aware that the costumer service they provide is very low in comparison to their  “premium” service announced (400 usd/night for 2 pax). Instead of following up with us on the info required/missing to make the dinner reservation, they just simply cancelled it 3 hrs before the dinner. Also, she said she'd reward us with a romantic dinner that never happened. Also, wifi at the dorms does not work. You will need to move to the dining areas or deck, and our pillow was dirty (bird sediment) when we entered"
50,"This place is absolute paradise!  The property is absolutely gorgeous and very secluded, one of only a few spots on a very long beach, with mountains behind, the ocean in front and surrounded by cactus.   There are just 16 individual log huts with palm roofs located right on the beach, each with a private patio with sun loungers, hammock and a plunge pool, and views looking right out to the ocean. The room is minimalist but luxurious, with a very comfortable bed, doors that open on either side to allow the breeze to blow through and provide an ocean view from bed. There are thoughtful amenities, such as flipflops, sun hats, robes, lots of nice fluffy towels and bug spray. We shared our room with some gekkos and there were some bugs around, but nothing terrible, almost like the"
50,"This property is like no other. It is so intensely secluded that you can look for miles on the beach and count less people than fingers on your hands...and we were there during the peak season. This also means there are no little stores or restaurants to visit anywhere within walking distance, and to get to Puerto Escondido entails a long, bumpy and expensive taxi ride. We were prepared for this and were happy to stay close to the hotel for our 4 day stay.   The architecture and design of the hotel is smart and sophisticated. The cabanas are perfectly designed and the mid-century-meets-the-desert décor is sexy. We loved hanging out on our private veranda at night and watching the stars twinkle. The pool is huge and perfectly heated and there are no screaming children. It's a"
20,"We stayed six nights at the Hotel Escondidos. We loved the location, the pool and the beach. The service was friendly. We enjoyed really good breakfast and diners.  However, if you are afraid of large insects and mouse, you should avoid staying at this hotel. The rooms are nice and it feels good to go to bed hearing the waves. But during our stay we found multiple cockroaches on the bed. On our last night there, a mouse felt from the roof directly in front of the closet and ran below the bed. We called the front desk, they did not seem really surprised, helped us to catch the mouse but did not really get how a problem it was for us. They only offered us to remove a a taxi drive from the overall bill (USD 70) when we have not slept well as we were afraid to find more animals in"
40,"My wife and I decided to visit more beaches of Oaxaca. We decided to go to Puerto Escondido and chose the Hidden Hotel for being in a good place and belonging to a known hotel chain.  When making the reservation, I requested the transport Airport-Hotel-Airport. It is not cheap US $ 74.00. When we arrived and leaving the exit door, there was a driver with my name already waiting. I had read in the hotel comments about the lack of drinking water in the rooms, so I asked the driver to stop at a convenience store next to the airport exit. I bought several bottles of water and good I did it, because in effect, there is no drinking water inside the hotel rooms. You must ask for it and they just fill a small jug in the afternoons.  We drove about 20 minutes from the Airport until a"
50,We decided to go on a mini honeymoon to Puerto Escondido and couldn't have chosen a better hotel! Everything about the hotel was exceptional! All the hotel staff was extremely friendly and always willing to help. We took a very early morning flight to fly into Puerto Escondido so ended up arriving to the hotel a few hours before check in but the staff did everything to make sure we were comfortable and happy while we waited for our room. From the very first meal to the last one everything was extremely delicious - definitely wished we had a bit longer to be able to try all the menu but that would mean staying forever as dinner is always changing! On our last night we even enjoyed a romantic dinner on the beach with a bonfire and that experience was one of a kind. The hotel is
50,"We had the most wonderful experience at Hotel Escondido! From the food to the people to the secluded location, it was everything we wanted for our relaxing vacation.   Location: The hotel is located about 40 minutes outside of town. If you are looking to spend a lot of time in town, this is maybe not the best hotel for you. For us, it was perfect! We traveled on a rural mountain highway about 25 minutes and then continue on a dirt road for another 15 minutes to get to the property.   Property:  - 16 palapas (rooms) - plunge pool for each room - infinity pool  - library - no kids (great for us)  Palapa: We were there in mid-May and while it was pretty warm, the ocean breeze kept us cool at night (also used the AC a bit). We kept our palapa pretty open day and night. The shower"
50,Hotel Escondido counts 16 bungalows 50 meters from a roaring ocean. Perfect spot to get away from the chaos of everyday life. The restaurant serves fresh healthy options. Staff is polite and attentive. You will love it here.
50,"We stayed 2 nights, and we did not want to leave. This hotel became our home away from home. Paul and Jane made us feel truly at home, so much so that we did not want to return to New Jersey. The rooms are large and clean. The restaurant has a very friendly atmosphere and the sangrias were prepared just how we like them. Paul and Jane we are coming back, for sure!!!"
50,"We returned again to the Flor de Maria, and as before Joanne and Paul, the hotel's long time owners and their staff of helpful and accommodating folks made our three week stay feel like visiting family without those tensions. Paul's recommendation of a hotel in Mexico City made the stopover on route and returning to the States a pleasant mini-stay. We flew into Huatulco, where they'd arranged for a taxi to pick us up like visiting celebrities. There was our name on a card with a smiling driver making the drive to Puerto a smooth transition. We checked in, got our smiling hugs, and we were sitting at the roof-top bar sipping a cold drink as the sun set dropped into the Pacific. As usual, Joanne's restaurant selections were terrific, and it's easy to see why visitors from other"
40,Friendly staff who are helpfully in setting up tours or answering questions.  The rooms are large and clean.  Centrally located. There is a small pool on the roof with a great view of the town.   It has an excellent restaurant open every day with the exception of Tuesday.   I received excellent help with both a birding tour and a diving tour.
50,"This place is faultless!  The location is perfect, on a quiet road just set back from Marinero beach, and very close to Playa Zicatela, but just far enough for tranquility!  The rooms are spacious and cool day and night and have two beds in each room and a large shower with plenty of hot water.  The rooftop terrace is perfect for relaxing in a hammock, taking a dip in the pool or enjoying a cocktail or cold beer whilst watching the sunset. The restaurant is wonderful, with a fantastic choice of fresh dishes which changes daily. However hard you try to visit some of Puerto Escondido's other great restaurant, you somehow keep ending up here! Finally, best of all is the hospitality; Jo-Anne and Paul (and their staff) are so accommodating you feel like a guest in their own home,"
50,"Our first night, we stayed in a beautiful hotel on the Aldoquin.  We had no idea how loud and tacky this strip would be.  Luckily, we found Flor de Maria for the following 3 nights.  Just a stone's throw from the beach and tucked away from the nightlife noise of the Aldoquin and Playa Zicatela.    But it was still so close to the day time activities of these places, it was quick and easy to hit the beach, watch the surfers, eat, drink, etc. in these spots.  Best of all, Paul (the owner) went above and beyond to make us comfortable and happy vacationers.  He gave us great tips on things to do, set up tours with the best (and most affordable) local guides, directed us to great food, etc.  When I got sick, he made sure to check in on me.  Bottom line: the dude cares a lot about"
50,"We were so lucky to stumble onto this hotel.  Looking for something not on the loud beach commercial areas (where the bulk of the hotel are), I came down a little street to see this lovely hotel with a peaceful courtyard.  It is half a block from the beach and between the two main beach area so you can take your pick.  The owner made us feel welcome and comfortable.  He offered to help with any side trips we were interested in.  He recommended a tour to see the turtles and lined it up quickly when we decided to go.  We loved the guide.  He also helped us arrange tickets to fly back to Oaxaca City after we experienced the 8 hour van experience.  The hotel is super clean, quiet and well tended.  I could not believe the price compared to the other hotels I looked into.  It is a"
50,"Staying at the Flor de Maria is like joining an extended family of owners, staff, and guests in a garden setting adjacent to one of the best beaches in Puerto Escondido. Starting with Paul and Joanne, the owners, I was welcomed into their community in both English and Spanish. The staff is long-serving and seemed always to be happy to be there and of great help. Many of the guests, I found out on this my first trip, often return and meet each other there annually. The rooms, restaurant, and roof-top were exceptional. This hotel made my trip to Puerto Escondido."
20,"Having decided we would like to stay at this hotel, my partner and I arrived with our infant daughter, and were kindly advised that children are not accepted. What a shame. I am posting this to warn any parents who may be considering staying at this hotel with their children. We did find suitable accommodation closer to the beach, at Zicatela."
50,"This lovely hotel was better than I imagined.  It is less than a 100 meters from Playa Marinero—a good swimming beach, and a about a 5 minute walk to either Playa Zicatela or Playa Principal.  The rooftop area with a pool, bar, and shaded hammocks as well as tables & chairs offers a wonderful view of the beach.  The restaurant on the premises offers excellent meals at reasonable prices.The neighborhood is quiet & feels very safe.  The staff is friendly.  The Canadian owners are very pleasant and helpful.  It is about a two minute walk to catch buses heading down the coast towards Puerto Angel.  The hotel is clean and secure.  Rooms have fans, screens & a safe.  A great value in an exciting town.  My wife & I will definitely book here again when we return to P.E."
50,"We had another fantastic anniversary party at flor de Maria.  Joanne and Paul and the entire staff go out of their way to make this annual party sooooo special.    After 15 years to PE, we enjoy dining at Hotel Flor de Maria during our stay in PE.  Marc and Jacque  Minnesota"
40,"Perfect place to hang out for a while. Nice Pool, hang out area, perfectly placed on Beach (Zicatella). Large range of rooms from plush apartments for a handful to cute bungalows. Stayed in Bamboo with my son and now ex husband for 2 weeks and it was perfect. Staff helpful and friendly. Owner speaks english, german and spanish. Very family Friendly. Scuba diving school on premises who will always let you know if the whales are passing and get you out to them. Food and bar great right next to pool. Reasonably priced. What more can you want"
50,"Sensational service form the moment you arrive!   The pool is clean and  relaxed and right next to the bar handy for pool side cocktails and coronas!  Puerto Escondido is one chilled out place, once you get there it is difficult to find a reason to leave.  The rooms here are simple and comfortable the hot water is reliable. Each room is decorated differently some have hammocks some have views, it is just such and easy going place well run and super friendly"
50,We were suppose to stay here for 5 nights but ended up staying for 10 nights!  We stayed in the Heike room/apartment which was fantastic. Such a great place to stay. The food is really nice and reasonably. Natalie the lady that greeted us is so helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend this place!
50,"We stayed here in an ocean view room with 4 friends and didnt want to leave! Its a great, cruisy hotel and very affordable. The rooms are very funky and beach friendly with big balconys looking over the famous Zicatela surf break. Right amongst all the nightlife and restaurants, Hotel Ines also has hammocks and a pool!"
40,"Hotel Ines is located right in front of the Surf Break Zicatela, in the middle of the ""beach strip"" which makes it's location unbeatable! There is sooo many rooms in this hotel, you are sure to find one for your budget... It goes from luxury room with ocean view to smaller cabana style room around the back for a fraction of the price. The restaurent has very good food and the staff is very friendly."
50,"My boyfriend and I travelled to Puerto Escondido with my sister and her husband and stayed at Hotel Ines for 4 nights. The location is perfect; directly across the street from the Zicatela beach, so you get a great view and sound of the waves. The room was very nice: we had two rooms, an air conditioner, and a balcony that faced the beach. The price was a little on the high side, but considering the amenities it was actually a pretty good deal. My only gripe is the water pressure in the shower, which left much to be desired.  There is a great pool with a small restaurant/cafe next to it. The food was fantastic, and very good value. The hotel is located in a great spot that is ideal for walking to shops, nightlife and surrounding beaches. The staff is very friendly and a great"
50,"Stayed for one night then decided to remain on for seven more days. Loved the room with balcony facing the ocean. Clean, bright, spacious room with very large (firm) bed and thick sound blocking walls. Has a security lock box in the room, remember to bring your padlock.  Bar / restaurant had great food and strong morning coffee. Later after dinner it became like a living room to socialize and meet new friends. Sort of like the neighborhood bars in Europe. Manager was very attentive. Room had a fridge which was great for those who prefer to grocery shop a little and have drinks and light meals in their room. Free WIFI reached everywhere and was high quality to support VOIP on G-Talk. Quiet at night yet only a short walk to the action down the strip or a serene sunset beach right"
50,"So many fine things to say about the Ines and the zicatela in general, suffice to say i have been coming for most of twenty years and it gets better all the time, the Ines is well run ,extremely friendly and accommodating and if possible only gets better, its the destination as much as all the wonderful things this part of Mexico offers, for me only the Ines"
50,"Once again I stayed here for 3 weeks, including the Chrismas and New Years period. Located in the middle of the Zicatela strip code to beach and everything else. I was there to join many others from all over the world to participate in a skydiving boogie, so was able to see others rooms at different hotels and nothing came close. Their restaurant at the pool was also outstanding. Rooms were very nice, clean with zircon and fan. Beds were softer than ant others in Puerto Escondido"
50,"We spent 3 lovely nights here after searching in the early morning for a hotel change.  We walked into the hotel Ines and were greeted by a lovely woman who speaks 3 languages.  She showed us a cute little bungalow that was artfully decorated, fan cooled, nicely lit with a table for 2 outside the door for only 380 pesos per night we took it.  The whole place has a nice chill out vibe, the pool is a relief from the heat (i'm not crazy about swimming in the ocean so the I loved the pool) and oh my gosh, the food in this place is outstanding! The guacamole is thick and chunky, the fruit salad/granola/yoghurt is more than generous, very good coffee, you have to have the seafood dinner for 2. So good.  The pasta is perfect, the margaritas during happy hour have lots of tequila.  The"
30,"Location location location .That is pretty much the best part of this hotel  The beach is wonderful .The personel at the beach club are fantastic. Our smallish room was well attended to by Arecilia who was always jovial .   With more attention to details and service this hotel could be awesome! That beeing said, the all inclusive package is not what you would normally expect,   rather more like a hotel with a meal plan .( We had to pay a premium for something as basic as capuccinos) . Based on other reviews, we were expecting the buffet to be small and we really did not mind that at all, except when the hotel was extra busy, then there was  quite a waiting time  to get food or service . Public bathrooms are subpar WI Fi . Frustrating    Tip: The beach club has the best internet"
40,Just returned from our first visit to Puerto Escondido Posada Real. This is a beautiful quaint little gem. We understand it was one of the very original hotels in the area. It has been newly renovated and we found it clean and the Ocean view upgrade is well worth it! The grounds are immaculate and the Cocos beach club was stunning. You won’t find music blaring or pool entertainment here. This hotel is quite and tranquil. The nightly sunsets are never disappointing with an ocean view from a rocking chair. If you are looking for a peaceful get away you will not be disappointed. We did find the food to be very predictable and somewhat mundane. With that being said we did find eating out very reasonable at the local restaurants some within walking distance or a short cab ride to
40,The hotel is located outside of main area of town and a short cab ride. The food is really good served throughout the day buffet style. Very relaxing either at the beach or pool.  Service is excellent and recommended for family or couples.
10,"By far this is one of the most outdated and rundown hotels in Puerto Escondido. Not worth the price, because the actual hotel is a 2 star hotel at an overpriced 5 star rate. There are better options at the edge of Zicatela beach. With far better food, entertainment, pool, and beach access. The owner/manager hangs around the property only talking to people he feels are wealthy and neglecting the larger percentage of his guests. "
20,We booked this place via Expedia and sent them a message a few days before we arrived to request a twin room. We never received a response to that message and on arrival were told we didn't have a booking. They found the booking a couple of hours later and there was no harm done. The staff came across uninterested and unhelpful but not rude.   The rooms are modern. A little small maybe. Ours had a bit of an ant problem but we bought a can of Raid which seemed to get rid of them. No safes in the room. Bathrooms are a little dated. Pool areas are fine but towels and sunbeds could do with a good clean. The beach directly in front of the hotel is nice but there aren't that many sunbeds on the sand.  One thing we weren't told when we booked is that this is predominantly an all
50,"Love this place, we had one of our most peaceful and relaxing vacations. This area is not a sell out to commercial tourism, and the surrounding beauty is some of the best I have seen. We had the most spectacular ocean view from our bed, could see the beautiful sunsets from our balcony. Really enjoyed the hospitality, we took a short walk to town or a cab ride to Zicatela and never felt uncomfortable. Coco's beach club has one of the best beach accesses I have ever enjoyed. The food was buffet but I looked forward to the breakfast omelet."
50,"We so enjoyed this low key hotel with amazing view and excellent service.We could sit and watch the whales breeching from our balcony, the garden bar or the generous number of rocking chairs provided on the lawn."
50,"I've returned this year for my vacation and was so happy with my choice to come back. This small, well maintained,  friendly, peaceful hotel sits on a most beautiful property with sunset ocean views second to none. This year I had one of the new ocean front, balcony rooms. This was spectacular.  The meals, beach club area, gardens and lobby area all met my needs perfectly. If I didn't want to sit around the beach or pool there were all kinds of places, shops and other beaches that I could walk or take a short cab ride to. The nightly turtle releases were always  entertaining. I swam in the ocean daily, always in areas where others were also swimming and didn't mind the ocean waves at all. Thanks to all of the friendly staff and beautiful hotel for my wonderful time!"
40,"Posada Real is very well situated in Puerto Escondido. The service and the staff was excellent.  The rooms are clean, the A/C is quiet and the mattresses are really hard. The food is average and the buffet is lacking variety. Since the price of restaurants in the area is extremely affordable and getting fresh produce is very accessible, I would recommend going without the all inclusive. The drinks selection is also extremely limited. The SunWing representant in the lobby was very helpful at answering our last minutes questions before we left for different attractions throughout the week."
40,"Great spot to relax. The property is well kept,. The rooms newly renovated and clean. The view from our room was lovely as we upgraded to a ocean view.  Great staff, helpful and friendly. Great beach area with all the amenities one needs close at hand; food, pool and bar. Beach area has lovely sand and lots of palm trees for shade.  A safe swimming area is close as is a place to walk the beach and watch the pounding surf. We were lucky enough to see breaching whales while walking!  Location of the property is close to a small strip of shops and cafes if you choose to eat out. Check out the Brown Sugar cafe. The place is immaculate and the owner very friendly and also has great coffee and smoothies.  Check out the other beaches close to the hotel. They are easily accessible by a"
50,"We stayed 6 nights in the newly added loft upstairs, and we loved every aspect of the room and facility. With the open wall design of the room, you can feel the cool ocean breeze at all times of the day and night. Nothing better than awaking to the sunrise in paradise. The room is VERY spacious; equipped with a large bed (and one smaller bed), mosquito nets, hot shower, and full kitchen! The kitchen was very nice as we mimicked our at home routine with French pressed coffee every morning :)  Without a doubt, we plan to return and book the same room! Lastly, the accommodations were incredibly clean, and you would be hard pressed to find anything nicer.  The owners, Manuela and René, were very courteous and helpful. Manuela provided invaluable recommendations for everything we"
50,"Super clean,quiet,perfect location and great staff.we stayed in the loft for 20 days and we felt like at home, during the day you can appreciate the sea wind and you can cook in your own kitchen.Very confortable bed and nice bathroom.👍"
50,"This is the best place we have stayed during our journey through Mexico. And this is also the reason why I write a review for it (I usualy dont do so). But you have to experience this beautiful, cosy and very romantic Oasis.  It has all a travelers heart need to rest. Unless you are those kind of people who need a TV and AC, then it's might not be the right choice for you. But if you like it calm, cosy and clean - this is it! The atmosphere is very relaxed and it makes you feel like home. The owners, Manuela and Rene, are there is you need anything but not are not instrutive like I have experienced in other places where the owner lives at the property.  The crowd: Most couples and single travelers Average age during our 10 days stay: 35  We will come back, for sure!!!"
50,"Been to Mexico many times, and I love it. Never had a bad hotel, meal, or margarita. This is our first time in Puerto Escondido, and obviously our first time at Hotelito Swiss Oasis. Manuela and Rene have a beautiful place. Need to know anything? They are right here with all the information you need. Our room? Super. Nice bed, cool, and spacious. With only nine rooms, there is always a spot at the pool. Half a block from the beach and less than that to a sea of great restaurants. We booked our trip in February, and looked forward to it for months. The second we set foot in the courtyard, we knew we made the right call. If there was something to complain about, it would be that we will have to eventually leave. I am working hard to grow extra arms so I can give it the fifty"
40,"loved staying here. hosts were incredibly helpful, friendly and accommodating. we loved the room and the pool was great. not sure we were aware the beach was not swimmable but likely thats our fault and based on a lack of research rather then anything else! everyone and everything at the hotel was great."
50,"We absolutely loved our stay here and can't recommend it highly enough! Manuela was super accommodating and the place has a great feel to it, nothing is a problem. AND such a nice and relaxed space by the pool to hangout when it is too hot to do much else. We'll definitely be back :)"
50,"Perfectly calm Oasis a few meters away from the main street in the centre of Playa Zicatela with plenty of restaurant options close by. The Swiss Owners are wonderful: super nice, helpful and always around when you need them. Rooms are spacious and really stay cool throughout the day without the need of AC. Perfect for some relaxing days and surfing some of thrilling waves!"
50,"I had a wonderful 9 night stay at Hotelito Swiss Oasis in August 2017. Manuela & Rene are extremely nice and so helpful with recommendations. The room is very quiet & comfortable & there is a very positive/happy energy with the other guests i met. I was there in summer and it was cool in the room with the fan and breeze. The location is right in the heart of Zicatela, near all the main beach bars & restaurants but you dont hear any noise as the Hotel is down a lane which is perfect. The pool is great if the waves are big and there is a very convenient self serve bar which is very nice. I will definitely be back!!!"
50,"My husband and I spent 4 nights here. We loved the quiet that you get by being a road back from the main strip. It felt like a little secret staying here! You are with in walking distance (1 min) to the beach, all the main bars and a sunset spot. The pool is lovely and clean and a real sun trap. After being served really bad coffee in many places we particularly loved the help yourself ""proper"" coffee. Lots of friendly, like minded travel types and the owner is super friendly. Another plus is the laundrette right next door that were doing 15 pesos a Kg of laundry! They even cleaned my tennis shoes for only 30 pesos. Book here and you won't be sad. If you are a beginner/intermediate surfer and you came to do more! The Zicatela beach was far far too powerful for us but it is a"
40,We stayed here from March 10th to 14th and had a very good experience.  I would have to say my comments would be very similar to the recent posts by Clare H or Yuba_11.  The rooms are basic but comfortable and people were respectful of not being noisy after 10pm.  The common kitchen is great especially the fridge and the hotel is close to all the restaurants and shopping that the area has to offer.  A taxi to one of the more calm beaches as 40 peso's and taxi's are plentiful.  Mirella was really helpful in arranging a surfing lesson for us which was a great experience.
50,"The Tabachin is located right at the intersection of Playa Zicatela and Playa Marinero, a minute's walk from either beach. However, the hotel is on a shady side street behind the Hotel Santa Fe, so it feels cozy, safe, and secluded given the incredible location.   Breakfasts were delicious, and sometimes fun social events with the owner Paul, his friends who stop by, and other guests. The courtyard where breakfast is served is shady and lush, and the coffee is delicious and the juice fresh-squeezed. Every day of my week-long stay started out wonderfully. I asked a few questions about the food, and Paul took me to the kitchen and invited me to talk to the cook about her recipes and methods.  The rooms were clean and spacious, and had wrap-around balconies. The rooms higher up"
40,"We had a good time in Hotel Tabachin. I may not be the most modern place, but it's charming and the owner Paul and his staff took very nice care of us. The price is fair and the breakfast very good - and it's only 3 minutes walk to the wonderful beach."
50,"Stayed for 9 days and enjoyed it very much.  Paul (owner) and his staff are very helpful and friendly.  Our room (more like an apartment!) was large, beautiful with a big wraparound balcony and was cleaned to perfection every day.  The breakfasts are amazing.  I am not a vegetarian but loved the tofu (homemade).  A great place to stay!"
50,"The Tabachin is so much the place I had hoped for. Vacations are precious time to me and I am so tired of the same old thing. The Tabachin is far from the same old thing. It is an anomaly. Beautiful room, wonderful breakfast, informative conversation, magnificent view, a few steps to the beach."
40,"Really amazing value at the Tabachin, perfect location, amazing breakfast, english speaking host.  Just be warned if you plan on participating in the nightlife, they are not too happy when you return at 4 am especially if you bring guests...  You will have to do a walk of shame similar to that when you live at home with your father at the breakfast table."
50,"I stayed at Tabachin for 2 weeks in May. It's a quiet, charming little B&B, tucked away at the end of a dirt road that may at first look a little dicey to the uninitiated, but is quite safe and wonderfully quiet!! Paul is an innkeeper extraordinaire, avid reader and keeps an eye out for his guests. There's also a nice view of the rocks and beach from the roof. I loved pulling up a chair, drinking a beer, and watching the sunset over Playa Marinero and Playa Zicatela. Ask about their weekly rates, which are very reasonable - especially compared to other options. I highly recommend this hotel (and I don't feel that way about many places)."
50,"To everyone who has or intends to stay at the Tabachin..you'll love it.  Actually, I can't remember if we stayed with Paul in FY06 or 07..not that it makes a difference.  My husband and I have travelled to Puerto Escondido every year over the past 20 years and love this place!  Actually, we've stayed in a wide array of hotels/condos/houses etc and the penthouse at the Tabachin was perfect.  Paul Cleaver is the perfect host and his staff are pleasant and helpful.  Paul's family also own the Santa Fe.  You can order coffee online from Paul's coffee plantation, but it can take a while before you get it.  Delicious!  I highly recommened the Tabachin and hope you enjoy your stay."
50,My husband and I just got back from spending a week at the Tabachin and we loved our experience.  We had the Penthouse that had enormous windows on three sides and a wrap-around balcony.  The view was breathtaking!  The staff was extremely pleasant and the breakfasts were outstanding.  We definitely plan on staying at Tabachin again!
50,just a great place out of the madness of puerto. i will go back there when ever i can. don pablo is a nice man. thx
50,"We had the Buddah Room overlooking the inner patio on this trip.  It's the smallest room and the loveliest by far.  Oyster shells tiled into the overhead lighting fixture, 19th century drawings from Goody Two Shoes framed on one wall, perfect natural lighting through two walls of windows.  Guests from around the world at the breakfasts, in several languages.  On this trip, we worked well forward on the ""Hotel Tabachin"" movie script, taking rich cues from the hotel's daily visitors and goings on."
50,"I agree with many of the other reviews: the setting of the place is exceptional, not the least because of the gardens. However, there is more: the owner apologized for the smallness of my room, so I assume I had one of the smaller units--but I was very comfortable. The separate bathroom was newly renovated and contemporary. The housekeeping was impeccable, sheets were changed regularly. The assistant Ivanna did a fantastic job: she contacted me in advance about my arrival, and gave me advice as far as taxis were concerned -- which helped me save a bunch of pesos! Also, Ivanna arranged for a driver to pick me up when I left, proactively, without me asking. The attentiveness was exceptional. The location is also notable: in the Rinconada neighborhood of Puerto Escondido, close to"
50,"Wow wow wow, this place is beautiful, the gardens, the location, but mostly the staff made me feel welcome, Ivanna is amazing, she took care of different things for us, she went out of her way to make us feel welcome and comfortable, I will definitely go back again. They a have a Restaurant in sight which serves breakfast, Rosy the Chef, cooks some food out of this world, the chilaquiles verdes are my favorites, the fruit salad and the coffee, the artisan bread and the home made marmalade is excellent. but i can't say anything less about them, even Chepe the garden keeper is very respectul and helpful.  Just one thing I would like to add and had nothing to do with the staff, but an improvement for the hotel, the rooms need Air condition, just he fan is not enough for the heat"
50,"The host is incredibly welcoming and helpful. The hotel is very clean. The garden is peaceful and is nice to sit in a hammock. The internet works well, and the beach is very close by. When you go down stairs to the beach I like sitting on the left side. Get some beers and sit in the chairs so you don't have to pay for a lounge chair. Cafecito nearby is a great little restaurant, as well as the one that begins with an M Mando? On Playa Zipolite (The Surfing Beach). There are many restaurantes and shops right near the hotel, especially the tile shop has beautiful artwork. The art within Macondo hotel is excellent. Sculptures, paintings, furniture. Everything is original and must have been done by a very prolific artist. When in Puerto Escondido, this is an excellent place to stay"
50,"We stayed at Villa Mozart y Macondo for 2 nights and found it one of the best places we've stayed anywhere in the world. Stylish, beautiful, friendly, kind people, lush gardens, and a pass to the beach club? Yes, yes, yes! It honestly could not have been better. Lovely Ivana and owner Angie were so kind and wonderful, we honestly feel lucky to have stayed here. So amazing, a rare paradise with kind and generous hosts. If I could give it 10 stars out of 5 I would."
50,We LOVED our 2 day stay here. We were able to leave our bags and explore a little since we arrived early. Ivanna greeted us and gave us so much information and a map.  She gave great recommendations such as Almoraduz for dinner. The room is huge with a huge comfy firm bed. Bathroom is good size as well. Everything is super clean! Bigger than normal fridge which is stocked with pitcher of water each day. Huge windows that let natural light in. The pictures from Orbitz do not do this place justice. Relaxing and charming garden with several places to sit and relax including a hammock and small table and chair on the room porch. The room didn't have AC but it had a super powerful fan that was adequate for March nights. Best part was the LOCATION! 5 minute walk to the steps to Playa
40,"We spent one night only on the suite. The room was extremely clean, lots of light and in a sand garden. Our only problem with the place was that we could not get the room with air conditioning and it is super hot!!!!! Too bad, I would have liked to stay in the place."
50,"The greeting when I walked into this place set the tone of my whole stay. I was warmly greeted by Ivanna and asked if I wanted a coffee straight away. This place is lovely and intimate and incredibly well looked after. Lovely and close to some amazing beaches and great restaurants- and far enough away from the business of down town that you ""feel"" like you're on vacation. I can't speak more highly enough about Villa Mozart y Macondo and the entire staff. Definitely eat breakfast there!!!"
40,"We stayed in the bungalow with kitchen and it is a really good option to save up on breakfast. Just 5 minute walk from playa Carrizalillo and the main street filled with restaurants. 15 min walk to 'el Adoquin'. Peaceful place with a great staff. Although during our stay we had constuction noise from 7 am, the owner came to explain and was very apologetic so no problem about that, it should be done by now. Good place to stay and relax for a few days."
50,"Wow! What a fabulous place! My husband and I stayed here for eight nights and absolutely loved it. The bungalow is comfortable, clean and full of charm. We loved relaxing in the hammock and it was so peaceful to be surrounded by so many lush plants. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful making sure we had everything we need. I will miss seeing their friendly smile everyday. The location is also perfect with Playa Carrizalillo a short walk away and plenty of restaurants and a little supermarket just around the corner. We would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone staying in Puerto Escondino. Thank you to all the fabulous staff for helping make our holiday so fun and relaxing. "
50,"The garden looks amazing, the staff is incredibly nice and helpful, and the location is perfect, right by the most beautiful beach of Puerto Escondido. We definitely recommend !! You can have breakfast there, and there are plenty of restaurants right nearby."
50,"Definitely clean. Not overcrowded.  You enjoy all the resort with no crowds. Staff is friendly. Rooms are excellent.  It is far from downtown, but we enjoyed taxi traveling and talking  to the driver as they always recommend places to visit and activities  to do. "
50,Wanted to relax for a few days and found Vivo. The hotel is great with beautiful rooms and pools. The beach is beautiful and I took a walk every morning. Apparently they have a.new manager company and they seem to be doing a good job. Met a few people and they told me.  Resort is far out and you come via a very rough road to get there but it is all worth it. Would go back in a heartbeat.
30,"We stayed here over the first week of Easter break, so naturally figured it was going to be busy.  Surprisingly, it was nice and relaxing, with not many people present.  We were able to get pool chairs every day without any issue.  The rooms and facilities were kept clean.  Wifi issue has been resolved, from previous complaints.  However, this resort needs to get their staff trained as soon as possible.  Everything regarding the management of this resort lacks in detail and care.  It will literally take you 25 minutes just to get your water once you order it.  Chips and salsa (or your appetizer) will arrive close to one hour after you sit.   Our dinner was delicious every single night we were at the resort with the exception of the last night.  Looking back, they had a"
20,"From start to finish, our stay here was a mess.  At check-in, we were not given the room we had reserved -- the front desk tried to stick us with a vastly inferior room.  After a big hassle, we got the room we had reserved, but at a highly inflated price.    Food service here is like, well, the worst diner you have ever seen.  The promised linguini or fettucine never arrived -- only overcooked poor quality spaghetti.  The rest of the menu revolves around burgers and omelets and something that was claimed to be pizza.  This is fair warning.  You cannot dine elsewhere unless you have a car because this place is so far away from civilization.    On the (rare) plus side, the room was clean and decently appointed.  The beach is basically yours -- there's nothing and nobody else"
10,"If you're an owner here, I would seriously suggest you check on your investment. Every owner I talked to in the 3 days we stayed here was upset about the management staff or lack thereof. We booked a 3 bedroom penthouse and paid mote than $400 per night. When we arrived on Sat night they had 1 person working the front desk that spoke limited English. They put us in a different room (4 bedroom condo) and said that the 3 bedroom penthouse we booked was not available because of a ""broken stairway"". We later found out this was a blatant lie, it was overbooked because of a wedding party. Over the next 2 days there were many other lies and avoidance altogether. Avoid this property if at all possible, the management is horrible, the service is nonexistent, the food is sub par for a"
30,"This place is strange, in the middle of nowhere with NOTHING else around for 30 minutes. There was a lot of construction going on, we were given a room directly next to construction and overlooking a construction site- we moved but could still hear the noise on both sides of us, all day and starting at 9am. Not nice when paying so much for a room. Other than that it is a bunch of private owned condominiums run as a resort so the two we saw were very different and different equipped kitchens, different furniture different layout so it's impossible to tell from the pictures what you're going to get.  The Wi-Fi is really poor as well. We didn't try the restaurant as we cooked our own food... I had both a massage and a pedicure at the spa and they were very poor and not worth the"
20,"The room that we are staying in is beautiful. Top floor overlooking the ocean and the pools. However, major problem that would prevent us from ever coming back here… Absolutely no Internet service in the rooms at all. The resort “says” they have Internet and they provide a password for Wi-Fi but it’s completely useless and there’s absolutely no signal whatsoever.  It sounds charming to say that you can disconnect however the reality is the world is connected these days and you have to access reliable Wi-Fi when you travel.  Also the resort is very remote and located 25 minutes from town so it requires a $25 cab ride each way if you want to leave the resort.   I read online that they have a hotel car to drive us but due to Covid they no longer transport guests.  Lack of Internet"
50,"We arrived early morning on the 15th and stayed in a 2 bed 2 bath unit. Condo was clean, modern and a great view of the beach with the waves crashing. You could really hear the loud waves crashing...so awesome. Meals at the restaurant we so fresh and tasty, great flavor!!!! Restaurant staff we very friendly and service was great!!!  Facility's were clean and well kept. The pools were warm and sparkling clean and with the infinity edge facing the Pacific ocean was the best. The resort was peaceful and calming being a few miles from downtown Puerto Escondido. We loved that!!!"
50,We just returned and spent a week.  Being it was our first time traveling in almost 16 months we are not sure what we should expect.  We found the resort to be going above and beyond following health protocols to help protect all staff and patrons.   The food and service was exceptional in Ernestos.  Although the one pool bar was closed the resort was fairly quiet and it was expected.    We arrived late and Carlos was able to arrange to have room service waiting four our arrival which was perfect.  Great place to relax and get away highly recomended.
20,"The hotel is in the middle of nowhere, 30 minutes away from the beach life. Is probably good for couples looking for a secluded nest, make sure to clarify first what you are looking for in your trip.   Wifi connection is very bad, and personally had a bad experience at check in: check in time was 3PM, it's 6.15PM and they are cleaning my room now...   For the price they charge (which is high compared to what Puerto Escondido has to offer) is not worth it. "
50,"We spend with our baby 6 wonderful days at Villa Lili. I loved the every day changing mexican breakfast, always fresh and always in a familiar and friendly atmosphere, a nice beginning of a day.  Adelina is a great host, makes everything possible. When our baby got very sick, she helped us a lot and this was a great support. Thank you!!!  The room we had, was huge and we had a great view, was always very clean like the whole hotel was. It´s close to nice beaches and nice restaurants. But in a quiet surrounding, a perfect place to relax.  A great host and great staff. I really hope to come back again!!!"
50,"We stayed at Villa Lili for 4 nights in January in the Exotica Suite. Everything was perfect - gorgeous room with jacuzzi and loungers, delicious fresh and filling breakfasts, great pool, peaceful location and excellent hospitality. Alex and Adelina were very welcoming and gave us some tips on places to eat and things to do. This included releasing baby turtles on a nearby beach which was a wonderful experience. The closest beach is idyllic - not too busy and warm clear water. We loved it so much we extended our stay by an extra night. Would definitely recommend Villa Lili!"
50,"We celebrated our 10 year anniversary here and enjoyed the master suite, views, delicious breakfasts and quiet time in the pool. The hotel is beautiful with handcrafted works, tiles and details throughout the property and a gorgeous collection of orchids that are in various stages of growth. Some of the fruit offered at breakfast time is grown right on the property! We got amazing recommendations from our hotel hosts for all our interests, many of which are very convenient to get to from Villa Lili. Villa Lili is a real oasis from the vast beaches of Puerto Escondido. This place was hard to leave!"
50,"Really not sure where to begin with explaining my stay here. My partner and I arrived here after a terrible trip down from Oaxaca and instantly felt welcomed and relaxed. We stayed in the master room, which every day was made to look immaculate. Each night we had an amazing view of the sunset, which I still miss now! The tours that Alex and Adelina recommend were fantastic! The hotel is close to loads of restaurants and a beautiful beach. Every morning we woke up so excited with what we had waiting for us at breakfast, I cannot even start to describe how incredible these were! The staff that work in the kitchen were such lovely and talented people, I still look at the pictures of all my breakfasts and wish I woke to that every morning. Because of the fantastic hospitality that"
50,"My partner and I stayed in the ‘Nemo’ room at Villa Lili in early January. We were on our honeymoon and it was the perfect room and hotel for a relax and unwind. The room had a private jacuzzi inside which was very fun and the view from the private balcony was breathtaking. We had full, uninterrupted view of the sunset every night! The hotel has a beautiful fresh water pool and is an easy walk to some great restaurants as well as beaches. Adelina, the host is very helpful. She gave us a map and pointed out some great places to eat in Puerto, as well as booked us in for some amazing day trips.If you request it, the hotel also makes a fresh, local breakfast for your every day! I would highly recommend staying in this hotel and exploring the beauties that Puerto Escondido has to"
50,"My trip to Puerto Escondido was one of the best holidays I've been on, and there's not much of the world I haven't explored. Villa Lili was a fantastic place to stay. The hotel itself is stunning, it had a great vibe and I really felt like I was holidaying in Mexico. The hospitality went above and beyond anything I could have imagined. Nothing was too much trouble and Adelina and her team truly went out of their way to ensure I had a wonderful stay. Villa Lili is positioned in a good location in Puerto Escondido. It's close to great restaurants and the beach. I was a single female traveller and had a ball but I'd also recommend it for couples and groups."
50,"Our family (my wife, our 4-year-old son, 1-year-old daughter and I) stayed 14 nights in Villa Lili over Christmas and I can say, hand on heart, that it was the most enjoyable hotel experience we have ever had. The rooms are really spacious and beautifully decorated, the location is second to none (within 100 yards of a strip of top class restaurants and walking distance of three great beaches), the breakfasts cooked by Sylvia and Irene are the best we have tasted in all of Mexico, the pools (adults and kids) at the back are the perfect place for a dip after returning from the beach. All of these things are fantastic but none fully explain our enthusiasm for Villa Lili. What really sets it apart is the warmth of the hospitality from Adelina, Alex, Luis and their team. They were"
50,"DIVINE!  Villa Lili and Puerto Escondido are beautiful and unforgettable. Put together you get all the wonderful parts of being on vacation in a tropical oasis while retaining the comfort of being right at home. Here, you are not a number, but instead are welcomed to be as much a part of the family that Luis and Adelina have created and the culture as you’d like.   They invite you to share a unique stay that honors your needs as a guest while infusing your stay with experiences and adventures that illuminate the wonders that the region has to offer. You can join in anything from eco-tourism such as riding high into the mountains on horseback with a local guide to natural thermal, healing pools to dolphin watching, releasing endangered baby turtles back into the ocean, to"
50,"Everything was spot on during our stay at this delightful hotel in Puerto Escondido. Rooms and grounds are kept absolutely spotless and are incredibly well thought-out in terms of style, space, privacy and comfort; criteria they fulfil to a tee. The staff are an absolute delight: Adelina, who runs the hotel, is helpful, friendly, great fun and, above all, passionate about the local area, actively giving tips on what to do, where to EAT (food being our favourite topic of conversation) etc. Irene and Silvia, who prepare and serve by far the best breakfast we have (and probably ever will) eat, are kind and welcoming, and we shared many a discussion on local cuisine and customs. Going back to the breakfast... A different hot breakfast, from potato or fish tacos, to ceviche, eggs and"
50,"We love Villa Lili. It is a wonderful small hotel with spacious rooms, beautiful grounds and an extremely gracious and helpful staff. We have been coming to Puerto Escondido for 24 years and Villa Lili is the most beautiful and comfortable place we have been. We think it is the best value and has the best service in town. It is a Bed & Breakfast, with great rooms - each one different – and comfortable beds with nice pillows, sheets and towels. But it is the breakfast that sets Villa Lili apart from others. The wifi is great and all your valuables are safe.   Every day, there are large bowls of fresh pineapple and papaya and a pitcher of agua fresca (fruit water). The pineapple is truly the most delicious we have ever had. There is also yogurt, granola and coffee or tea. But, the"
50,We arrived in Puerto Escondido dripping in sweat and shaken from a motor vehicle accident we had been in on the way. It didn't take long for this lovely place to work its magic. I could have stayed in the pool all day. The owner was very friendly and his staff were very helpful. There seems to be a community of retired people that spend winters here. The location was perfect for almost anything we wanted to do - there was a surfing beach close by with lots of restaurants and it was only a cheap cab ride to other neighborhoods to check out other restaurants or beaches. Our room by the pool was very comfortable. No complaints. I attended the morning yoga classes in a very pleasant second floor yoga studio onsite. The only thing I wasn't quite so excited about was the restaurant.
50,"This place was an unexpected oasis. The grounds and pool are meticulously maintained, my room was breezy and comfortable with interesting decor. The weekly dinner for guests was delicious and a nice way to meet other travelers. I will stay here again and again!"
50,"All aspects of Casamar were delightful. Close proximity to all the fun, food and quirkyness of La Punta and an easy 10 minute ride into town and the wonderful Zicatela beach just outside the door. Highly recommend "
50,Absolutely brilliant hotel. The management and staff really went out of their way to help. My flight there was cancelled and they changed my booking and didn't charge me for the lost night and then when I finally arrived the next day they gave me a free upgrade to a bigger room. Such fantastic service!   The rooms and grounds are beautiful. The wifi is super fast. The swimming pool is fantastic and there's a great atmosphere around the whole place. It's also very close to the beach and to restaurants and cafes etc. I just wish I could have stayed longer. 100% recommended.
50,"Spent 7 wonderful days there. Will the owner and staff are so accommodating. Free supper on Tuesday, free movie and popcorn Thursday, fantastic pool and yard. Loved it!  Will be back!  Rooms are great. Loved the kitchenette and probably best wifi I’ve seen."
50,"This was more guesthouse than hotel.  It was a lovely and personal setting, with lush gardens, a small but attractive pool, rooms and suites of various kinds.  It was comfortable, attractive, restful, friendly.  The staff were all accommodating and helpful, the rooms were spotless and attractively decorated  - everything comfortable! The breakfast and lunch food was fresh and delicious. I also loved the location - perfect access to beach in the quiet and charming Punta neighborhod.  I would definitely go back, and recommend this lovely little spot."
50,"My 2 kids and I stayed at Casamar for nearly a week.  We loved the chlorine free pool, the lovely art everywhere and the friendly people.  We wouldn't hesitate to spend a month or longer here.  It's very close to a quiet area of the beach, perfect for watching the sunset every night."
50,"Mexico is the most polite country I have visited and the Casamar is one of the most enjoyable hotel stays I have had. The grounds are attractive, the rooms immaculate, decorated colourfully in Oaxacan colours. Staff are great. These are very personable people who seem to enjoy their jobs and guests.  The little restaurant serves freshly made and tasty food. Other guests are mostly older, friendly-people who seem to have returned year after year. It is steps away from Zicatela Beach with magnificent sunsets and truly inspiring breakers. It is about 3 miles to PE but a taxi only costs $50 MXN or about $2.60 USD. One more thing, the temperature is pretty much about 85F with cloudless, azure skies."
50,"This is our 3rd stay with Casamar Suites in Puerto Escondido.  As Usual, the staff was exceptional.  We stayed for 10 nights. Onsite cafe open each day from 8am - 4pm with some of the best guacamole. We also had coffee there most mornings poolside.  The front desk staff was always very responsive to any of our requests.  We set up all our excursions and cab rides through the front desk. Most of our cab rides were into town for food or to go snorkeling.  Average cost was 50 pesos (less than $3 US).  My spouse took advantage of the onsite massage which she loved.  She said it is by far the best value for the quality of the massage she has ever received. You have to attend the Meet and Greet.  This is a very friendly atmosphere with great food and a great way to meet other guests"
50,"We wanted to check out Zicatela but we had a feeling some areas might be kind of loud with nightlife, etc. This place ended up being very peaceful and quiet, and just the right distance from the fun strip of spots in Brisas de Zicatela.   Just so you know, to get your bearings, the main part of Zicatela is busier and more developed, with lots of bars and restaurants and a lively nightlife scene. At the end of the strip, the area known as Brisas de Zicatela (or punta de zicatela?) is more of a backpacker surf scene, less developed, with super casual, shoe-optional, sandy bars and cafes catering to the hippie/hipster crowd. Casamar is just a few blocks walking distance from that little neighborhood, which is super fun.  We loved our apartment there (Gardenia), which was clean,"
50,"Incredibly relaxing during the day and, if the mood is right, its like attending the best house party at night. You'll share drinks and stories with the owners and guests in what was the friendliest hostel of our 4 months travelling. Excellent staff know the area well, mostly because they are all guests who simply never left and were offered work!   The owners are incredibly invested in the place and are the heart and soul of it, installing solar panels to make it environmentally friendly, despite it not being financially the best move. They take all feedback to heart and will bend over backwards to make sure your every need is catered too. Truly lovely people.  Me and my girlfriend arrived, with my girlfriend suffering from a severe illness, the owners new a local english"
30,"Nice hostel, excellent staff, beautiful pool. But, I got eaten alive and was told that it was not bedbugs,.. it was. sorry, hope the proble gets cleared soon. I almost did not write, but decided i would like a warning if I was thinking of staying here. No one else was bitten, so it may have just been my mattress.?"
50,"This is the first review I have ever written, for good or for bad.  For this place I felt I had to make the effort to write one.    Tower bridge is exactly what you want in a backpackers hostel.  It's fun, welcoming, well priced, relaxed and it is set up perfectly in a spacious and well laid out contained area, amidst a tropical garden that boasts a great pool, different communal areas, a pool table and a kitchen!.    I wanted to write this review as some people say that it's not in a great area, but I disagree.  I've been to puerto 5 times in the past 5 years and most the times I have stayed here because it's close to the market, which is great for breakfast and is the best place by far to buy cheap and fresh produce and it's also within walking distance to the best 2 swimming"
50,"Amazing hostel with a such good atmosphere and vibes. Very pretty common areas with the swimming pool and hammocks. It also very well constructed to meet people with the bar and the pool table. The owners and volunteers are very kind and there are here all the time to help you, meet you etc. I especially recommend if you want to have fun. The only bad think would be that it is a bit far away from the centre and beaches but taxis are very cheap. And there is a very nice woman just in front of who sells amazing quesadillas ! Well a place to go"
50,"Stayed at tower bridge for 5 nights when we initially planned for 2. This place had such a warm, friendly, family vibe from the minute we walked in. I wasn't feeling well for a couple of the days and the staff where incredibly helpful- finding and calling a local doctor for me and genuinely making me feel cared for. There is a really nice pool and plenty of hammocks in the shade to escape from the heat- a bar and a kitchen with the local market close by. Highly recommended this place :)"
30,The atmosphere and the staff are pretty cool but the location is its downfall. In town and a decent walk to any beaches. The place could do with a decent clean. Don't bother with brekky. Mattresses need replacing. I guess it's good value for money because it's dirt cheap..
40,Couldn't have asked for a more fun filled week with great people!! stayed here throughout semana santa and couldn't have had more fun!! chilled out by the pool to escape the heat than had beers at the bar by night with colin the bartender who was an absolute legend!! the owners were constantly working on the place doing maintenance and making it a more presentable! only down side was that the beds could be a bit better with decent pillows and maybe some individual fans since it is so hot there! but other than that its a great place.
50,"I had never stayed in a hostel before... This one is DEFINITELY one of my best experiences of my life!!!! Beautiful pool, friendly staff, upcoming renovations making the place even more spectacular!!! Walking distance to beautiful beaches and local markets. I cannot WAIT to return :)"
20,"Well, they obviously got one of the best place I've been (talking about hostel) in Mexico, plenty of colors, super nice swimming pool, well decorated and chill bar, but unfortunately that's only the place...  Not really well located, far from the city center and beaches,  Okay it's 100pesos for a dorm which is correct but you should pay 40pesos for the breakfast, you also pay for the water (the first time  I've seen that in Mexico), and it's definitely not clean, nowhere, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, outside........ Really bad point. Beds in dorm is not comfortable at all. NO ONE speak Spanish, even the receptionist, but come on you are in Mexico.  And anyway they aren't friendly, doesn't look open minded to others peoples. Never smile or a super fake one, even the owners..."
40,"I loved this place!  I travelled on my own and this was the first hostel experience on my trip. I had been worried not making any friends and this hostel was just the perfect spot to hit. They have lots of long time volunteers working which makes it easy to get in to their little group of friends. Everyone just hung out together, went to the beach together, took surfing lessons together and went out together.   Only bad thing is the location, but if you get a collectivo its not more than 7 pesos to get to la punta. Cab is cheap as well if you share.   Over all great experience!"
40,"Very well located, clean, cozy and comfortable. Make sure to rent one of the villas with an ocean view. Just enough comfort while maintaining Puerto Escondido’s laid-back essence.  We had the stairway to Carrizalillo Beach right from our villa.  The pool is small. The restaurant is quite popular among local people. "
20,"The view from our villa was amazing and Playa Carrizalillo is a gem. The villa was big, comfy and well equipped. Unfortunately, the hotel is not very friendly with the environment:  abandoned concrete stairs leading to the beach for new wooden ones, abandoned pipes on the cliff... We ate every day at the hotel restaurant (4x breakfast and dinner), good food but we got comments from staff if we left any tip under 15%. We did not get any 'thank you for your stay' or 'how was your stay' when leaving which you would expect not only from starred hotel but from any hospitality business. We do not need to be pampered at a hotel and did not come to a starred hotel for extra treatment but we always appreciate warm and simple exchanges which we did not get at Villas Carrizalillo. "
50,"We stayed in Villa Holanda in July 2017.   The hotel is located on a cliff above the best beach for swimming and beginner surfing.  There is a restaurant at the hotel which we felt was a little on the pricey side for the area, although the food was good. About 5 minutes away is a promenade of restaurants, including an excellent Italian restaurant, so there is plenty of choice.  We are vegetarians and had many option - we stayed a week. Puerto Escondido ""town centre"" with a market and more restaurants and hotels is about 15 minutes walk away. Walking into town we notice how blessed the location of the hotel is, it would get noticeably hotter walking into town.  Our villa was comfortable and much like described on the website. The hotel has a charming little pool and several"
50,"My vacation here was a splendid getaway. This place allows you to see gorgeous sunsets, enjoy time by the ocean, and make unforgettable memories. It was a tucked away villa where you can relax and enjoy the ocean view, but also very close to areas to shop and eat out. The friendly staff and cleanliness of the villa made my vacation more enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone looking for the perfect beach getaway and I would definitely come back again!"
50,"Clean clean clean, I've never been to such a clean place.  Friendly and accommodating staff.  Sunrises and sunsets were amazing to watch swinging in a hammock while enjoying a margarita and listening to all the birds.  The beach was incredible, was like having a private beach.  On-site restaurant food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  The green juice was delicious and nutritious. The staff went out of their way to help celebrate the birthday of one of the girls in our group, it was awesome. Would recommend this place to anyone, can't wait to come back next year."
50,"I don’t want to share this little piece of heaven-on-earth (so I can keep it all to myself) but yet I want everyone to know how wonderful it is.  Our vacation at Villas Carrizalillo was more than I could ever imagine.  The Villas were so authentically charming and cozy and of good quality.  VERY CLEAN!  We felt so at home. QUIET. RELAXING. The views from our villa were breathtaking.  Sunsets were magical.  Absolutely beautiful!  The size of the beach was perfect.  It felt like “our beach”.  And it was right there! The restaurant, located on top of the villas, served very good food, great staff and the ambiance was fabulous.  And it was right there! You can stroll a few blocks to a strip where there are a variety of numerous charming restaurants along with a bodega, shops, etc. "
40,"Great staff, terrific location if you want to be right at the beach andlike a laid back atmosphere (it's not the disco scene). One caution - don't eat in the on-site restaurant. Service was good but food really bad. Really. And pricey! It's a 5 minute walk to El Cafecito sidewalk cafe and bakery where breakfast, lunch , and dinner are delicious and prices are great. Also we had  a really good breakfast one morning at the beach at the bottom of the stairs from the Villas."
50,"I have traveled and stayed here twice and it is one of my favorite places on earth,  The views are breathtaking, the villa we have stayed in is gorgeous and equipped with everything you may need, the staff is so attentive & friendly and the food at Espadin is always delicious.  I can't wait to go be back!!"
40,"My partner and I spent three nights there.  Quiet, lovely views and a great beach which is below the hotel and not really accessible for those who are not mobile.  Meals in the restaurant were fine.  Only drawback worth noting is that the lighting in our room was poor, making it pretty much impossible to read a book for any period of time."
50,"My family had a magical week at Villas Carrizalillos.  Our Villa was well equipped, great porch and hammock... perfect for relaxing.  Its a short walk to the stairs down to the beach and beachfront restaurants.    The food, views, and staff at the Villas restaurant were great.  Its a great place to relax, eat, enjoy the views, hang at beach and disconnect.  Truly magical"
50,"What an amazing experience this place is! I can’t wait to be able to bring my family back, and recommend this place to friends. The staff is amazing; just to chat with or with questions about the facility. The frozen mojito was sooo good ( highly recommend ) and the rooms were thought out perfectly. We showed up on a Thursday which is live music, and it’s so much fun bringing people from all over to the hotel, and just overall a great vibe. If your thinking of booking this hotel over a large resort.. do it, just try it and I am telling you; you won’t regret it!"
50,"Everything went great on our trip to Puerto Escondido and our stay at Casa de Olas. We arrived too early to check in, but the staff was really accommodating and allowed us to leave our luggage in a safe spot. Everyone was really laid back, smiles everywhere and the staff was great overall. The place has this zen vibe on all its areas and delivers a really consistent and peaceful atmosphere. The yoga/workout room has a phenomenal view and it really invites to enjoy your workout. They did provide me with the best yoga class I have ever experienced thanks to their amazing, knowledgeable and capable instructor Charlotte. They keep great attention to detail such as placing earplugs in the room, their decoration of the place, or even providing neat yoga mats and hand wraps ready to"
50,"My partner and I loved the location. It is a short walk from many great restaurants, cafes, the beach and cocktail bars. The room was great. The bed was comfortable and I enjoyed the balcony. The staff was exceptional. They were friendly, helpful, and always had a smile. Javier went above and beyond on our first night when he offered to run an errand for us- my partner and I were visibly exhausted from the traveling so we were very thankful. The front desk staff, Josmar and Mimi were super helpful as well. At the end of each evening, Raquel was always available to listen to our stories. Gracias, Raquel! Dale un abrazo a Winston departe de nosotros:) We only saw Oliver one night but, boy, did he make an impression on us. Real nice guy.   The hotel offers a wide range of fitness"
50,"The staff are tremendous and this hotel has everything you could ask for and more! Perfect location, amazing food and so much to do. Don’t miss the live music nights!  The atmosphere at this hotel is amazing. I will be back!!"
30,"I stayed 4 days at the hotel, which is perfect to stay one or several days in Puerto Escondido, it is located in Punta Zicatela about 3 minutes walking from the beach and everything you need to have a perfect time. The employees of the place are the best, always giving excellent service. Unfortunately they offer tours and ditch you, an incredible way to spoil a vacation and a service that so many people insist on. They summoned us 7 am to go see whales and dolphins. The ""guide"" never came, no one from the hotel knew how to solve it, much less tell you anything. I was for more than 1 hour and a half waiting for them to tell me something but I never had a response from anyone. As if this is normal for them. Outside of this you can have a very good vacation but do not request a"
50,What an amazing way to experience the true Mexican culture. Only a 2 minute walk from the main strip/beach in La Punta. Staff was great and extremely accommodating. Awesome food and drink selection. And the accommodations are 5 Star. Nothing even comes close in the area. I would highly recommend.
50,"My stay at Casa de Olas was nothing short of amazing.  A special thank you to all the staff. They went over and above to ensure our stay was perfect. They were all so friendly and we had so much fun with them. The resort was sparkling clean, the food was great and the beaches were incredible. The location was perfect as all amenities were at our finger tips. I highly recommend staying at Casa de Olas , you will not be disappointed. We truly couldn’t have asked for a better hotel."
50,"Have stayed at a lot of beautiful resorts but this was definitely my favorite place. Food was amazing, highly recommend the tacos and quesadillas with chicken ! Loved playing tennis and staff are so great. Few minute walk to a spectacular beach and lots of great restaurants and nightlife. Rooms are clean and the one I stayed in was huge with very nice kitchen area. Make sure you are there for Thursday when they have live music. I will definitely be back and recommend to all my friends and family. If your going to Puerto Escondido or Huatulco this is the place to stay!"
50,"This hotel is amazing from the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave.  There is something for everyone to do from Tennis, Numerous workout classes, massage studio.  The beach is a very short walk away.  Within 2 or 3 minutes.  Besides the Hotel being in great shape the staff treats you even better.  Everyone is always smiling and trying to make sure everything perfect.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to go to Puerto Escondido!"
50,"What an incredible experience. The room was fantastic,( lots of space), the staff was incredible and the excursions and classes available were amazing. Everyone there, even other guests are friendly and gave this place an incomparable atmosphere. Great choice of food. Try one of the fitness classes while you're there. Everything from surf, yoga , boxing. My only regret was not enough time and not trying more classes."
50,"After staying a week in Puerto Surf it was time to leave, which I did reluctantly. The week was spent with daily surf lessons, under the professionel and safe guidance from David and his team. It was a lot of fun, and my surfing skills improved immensely. The surroundings in the surf house and the area were perfect for relaxing, exploring the area and if in mood for a party, this was also within a short distance. The room was lovely and each night i feel asleep to the sounds of the waves breaking."
50,"My girlfriend and I spent10 unforgettable days in Puerto surf ! This surf house located in La punta de Zicatela is perfect for those who want to surf and rest in a quiet and peaceful atmosphere, 2 minutes walking to a wonderful spot surf. The Owners, David (Mexican) and Swantje (German) are very kind and caring people with their clients. Surf lessons are given by David and his instructors, all very dedicated to the transmission of their passion.  The house is lovely and has a lovely tropical garden with ""hamacas"" where you can have a nice ""siesta"" during the day. Rooms are simple and comfortable, equipped with a fan and mosquito net. There is also a kitchen to share, cook and prepare food. You will also appreciate the small restaurants very close to the surf house, where you can"
40,"We spend a week end in the Surf House and we had a really good stay. Cosy place in front of the beach, run by a very nice couple. They also provide surfing lessons, of good quality. Maybe we would have appreciated hot water in the bathroom to have an hot shower, but luckily the weather was warm enought to put up with it."
50,"Had a great stay at this small spot by the beach in La Punta. The owner was a gracious host and went out of her way to make sure my friend and I were both comfortable. The break at la punta is a bit crowded for what it is, but the surf house was a great spot to call home base when exploring the area around Puerto Escondido. Simple, clean and friendly."
50,"My friends and I had an incredible time with David and Swantje. The property is cosy and comfortable, and the surf lessons were excellent. Thanks to their attentiveness, support, and tireless support, we all got up multiple times! And then relaxed in their hammocks after - It was magical.   Highly highly recommend."
40,"So surfing is not easy.  But they got me up.  It was amazing.  The instructors are all great surfers and had us in the water shortly after arriving at the beach.  The accommodations are great, simple and  a lot nicer than I expected.  Only catch was no Air conditioning which was a little tough coming from freezing temperatures back home.  Walking distance (half a block) to the beach and waves.  Great place to hang out outside checking your email on the free wifi."
50,"Just got back from an excellent stay at Puerto Surf house. Though the owners were away, my friend and I were well-looked after by Nazer and Sylvia. Met some great new friends who were staying there as well. Clean rooms, excellent surf lessons. I talked to a bunch of other travellers in the neighbourhood and they all said Puerto Surf was easily the best place to stay. It was booked solid so book early! I fully intend to return and feel it's safe enough to come alone next time. "
50,I had a wonderful time here! The host family is very amiable and helpful and the rooms are very nice and clean. The openair kitchen and the hammocks in the beautiful garden are the perfect place to relax and the beach is just around the corner. The surf lessons were great and we went to different beaches (according to the daily wave conditions). I definitely want to go back and I highly recommend this place to everyone looking for accommodation and surf lessons in a laid-back atmosphere!
50,"I recently spent a week at Puerto Surf House after a stressful 2 week workshop and was looking for a place to relax and unwind - and I definitely found it here. The location of the house is perfect, about a 30 second walk from the beach and one street back from the ""main drag"" where the restaurants are. The house itself is fantastic with beautiful flower filled gardens around it. Nothing better than relaxing in the hammocks after a day spent relaxing on the beach!  I stayed in Room 4 on the first floor; simple, clean and perfect. At night I slept well with a mosquito net over the bed, the fan on low, and only the sound of waves breaking, crickets chirping and geckos to be heard. There is an outdoor kitchen with a gas cooktop, cooking utensils and fridge that is available for"
50,"I have traveled extensively in Mexico and I felt this was the best bang for your buck type of deal. During this trip we visited Oaxaca, Oaxaca and had stayed in a hostel (similar to this surf house) but that was a total mess.   Puerto Surf House is very reasonably priced for what you get. The surf lessons almost feel like a bonus since the rooms the packages are very inexpensive.    The only thing my boyfriend and I wanted to advise is that the rooms do not have AC. Therefore, you must leave your windows open and this makes you feel like there is not much privacy.  We stayed on the first floor and people tend to gather in front of our room. Not having AC also makes you feel very warm at nights. I typically don't mind but my boyfriend had trouble sleeping because he felt very"
50,"The staff here are amazing.  Sergio, the owner is so helpful and asks to make sure that everything is fine and that the guests are happy.  He went out of his way to try to help us make flight arrangements to Oaxaca. Ieda, at the front desk is very nice and so helpful as well. Flora, the maid in our room was amazing.  She made cute towel animals and she did a great job of cleaning. The pool fellow (can't recall his name) did an excellent job of keeping the pool clean. Everyone there was so friendly and helpful.  The architecture of this Mexican hotel is lovely.  The view from the top floor (of Zicatela  and Principal Beach) were amazing, as well as the sunrises.  Sharing a kitchen was easy when there were only two rooms sharing, but when it got busy, and with various"
50,"Staying at the Hotel Paraiso Escondido was the highlight of my trip to Puerto Escondido. A terraced and rambling grand hotel full of charming, whimsical details - a true work of art, created by a German transplant. It's currently managed by his gracious son, Sergio, who does an excellent job maintaining the property and overseeing the staff. My room was large, bright, and airy, with high ceilings and lots of character, a generous shower with plenty of hot water, and a lovely balcony with a panoramic view. There is also a very nice pool that's cleaned daily. And,I loved the location...walking distance to good restaurants, the Bahia Principal, and the fabulous El Mercado in the downtown area."
50,"Hotel Paraiso Escondido had everything we were looking for for our beach vacation.  It's location is great - about a mile walk or an inexpensive taxi ride to all of the beaches in the area, close to the pedestrian street, and near a bank and super store for any supplies you might need.    We stayed in a king suite that was lovely.  The room was huge and had tons of great built in storage.  We had a lovely balcony that overlooked the town to the Pacific Ocean and could sit there and here the birds chirping each morning and evening.  The room was clean and well-maintained.  The staff were friendly and helpful as well, and were always willing to give us suggestions and advice."
40,"Puerto Scondido can be hot ! As can Jaipur India, however the talented individual who created this fine establishment has given back to the arts community through creating an enviroment consisting of stone carving, fresco painting, tiling and a range of other wonder Architectural finishes all with a touch of the Pink Palace India dashed with a Morocan favour. The rooms are rooms with a view, the bedding firm and comfortable and the bathrooms large and well finished, the pricing is moderate.  No Breakfast ! No fridge to keep a cold drink, and missing the vital ingredient of room service for icy cold beers or a coke. That said the eclectic mix of design and decor puts this hotel in the unique category and I would not hesitate to recommend it."
40,"This hotel is so charming.  I am sure it was a large grand hotel in its time.  The location is walking distance to all the beautiful beaches and restaurants and also the mercado.  This hotel is clean, and the staff is very helpful.  Aida is an exceptional person for all information for places to see, restaurants and she even helped us with getting a plane reservation and getting us in contact with the right people.  She saved us,1 day of travel.  Her customer service skills are awesome but let me not forget to mention everyone that helps maintain the place also do a great job.  "
50,"The place is nice and clean. Close basically to everything. Both main beaches are 5 minutes away in taxi, or a 15 minute walk. The staff is friendly and helpful. We stayed in one of the suites with a great view. We will definitely be back. We needed to send a package and they helped us even to get a box to send our stuff in. Sergio is a great host."
50,"We wanted to go to a nicer hotel after traveling a bit and that's exactly what we received at Paraiso Escondido! It's close to most of the beaches but quite,clean,great AC and great service.... The pool was nice and clean and felt great after we had been in the beaches for so long.. The front desk will call you a taxi whenever you need one and the taxi usually arrives within 5 min and are super cheap.. The restaurant was closed due to slow season starting but they gave us a key to the kitchen and said we could store food in it if we like. Over all everything was great! If you need a quite place to relax this would be it :) "
50,"my wife and I needed to get out of the heat and some of the charmlessness (and mosquitos!) of smaller coastal town in April.  This place saved the day!  75 years old - old school details, some quirky, all delightful -- ac and internet ! nice people - clean pool -  all these architectural details and whimsical artistic touches that you just dont find anymore - not ultra modern - better than that - like finding a Hitchcock film at the mutliplex"
50,"Beautiful hotel. Rooms were clean and had everything needed. Small terrace with space enough to chat and play cards at night. Clean swimming pool that is perfect for playing. Great hammocks around. Only 2 minutes to shopping street and beach, but also close to the city and ADO bus station. The receptionist and owner were really helpful and nice, cleaning staff were always smiling. Only negative was the staff at the restaurant wasn't so nice. But don't let that scare you away. The place is really nice."
50,"The hotel staff is very accommodating. This place has great views and the pool and courtyard are really nice. Landscaped beautifully this hotel represents the extraordinary Mexican architecture. A short walk to great restaurants and the beach. A bank on the corner We love this place. As nice as the place is, the part we like the most is the totally responsive, staff. Sergio, Aida, and the staff do everything they can to assure your  satisfaction. It's economical as well. There is nothing here but beauty and a great time."
50,"We enjoyed 10 days at Quinta Lili and were sad when our stay ended.  This small hotel is the perfect beach accommodation in Puerto Escondido.  It's close to the beach and good aerobic exercise walking the stairs to a wonderful protected cove.  The rooms, grounds and pool are clean.  But the best parts are the staff and breakfasts.  Adelina made us feel like we were her Aunt and Uncle.  She genuinely cares about her guests and works long hours to ensure they are happy.  Magdelina cooks and cleans and is a jewel.  She has the most beautiful smile and displays it all day long.  By day two the entire place feels like your most comfortable  pair of jeans.  If you can't relax and enjoy yourself here you're trying way too hard."
50,"We enjoyed a fabulous week at this B and B and will be back.Fantastic location, great suites, great staff and super hosts.Food was fresh and tasty each morning. It made our first trip to this area special."
50,"We stayed in the top room with the spa and it was incredible to say the least. We loved having drinks in the spa (which is kept very clean by the way), watching the sunset. Just a short walk to the beach."
50,"We had a wonderful holiday staying at Quinta Lili. Our hosts Adelina and Luis were so welcoming and assisted us with everything from airport transport to helping us choose the best restaurants to eat in. Quinta Lili is in the perfect location to enjoy your Puerto Escondido holiday, away from the heavy tourist areas of Zicatela, yet within easy walking distance to beautiful beaches and great restaurants. Everything is an easy cheap taxi ride away and we always felt very safe there also. The breakfast at Quinta Lili is delicious with a selection of home cooked Mexican dishes and fresh fruits. Thank you again to Adelina and Luis for making our holiday perfect. Kiralee and Steven"
50,"We spotted this hotel from the road before the taxi dropped us off and It looked fantastic with a quirky spotted dome and a thatched roof. Once inside we fell in love with its little bridge over a pool and the balcony you can sit and dangle your legs off. The owner Luis appeared to give us lots of great information on all the brilliant things you can do in the local area (dolphin spotting, massages, yoga, turtle releasing, surfing etc.) and told us he had designed the house himself. You can feel how homely and personal this place is and Luis make you feel right at home. He even went to fetch some mint tea from his garden for a guest who wasn't well. Very kind! The hotel is located on a quiet road. It is a 2 minute walk from a street of really nice restaurants/cafes. Our room was"
50,"My husband and I stayed in Quinta Lili for 4 nights, and we loved it. The staff were great. Luis was very helpful in helping us plan our activites (we went to the Temazcalli Spa one day and did the baby turtle release activity - both were awesome). We stayed in the master suite on the second floor, which was really nice. There is not air conditioning, but with all the windows open (there are of course screens) and the multiple fans blowing, it was very comfortable. The bed was also comfortable. Quinta Lili is a short walk from the beach Playa Carrizalillo, which is an amazing beach. It's also very close to lots of restaurants and some shops, and a market which was very convenient. The homemade breakfasts were delicious, and they made us dinner one night which was also great. We"
50,"My husband and I spent five days here. It was absolutely fantastic. The staff was phenomenal. Location is great -a short walk to one of the main drags with bars and restaurants. Various beaches are walk-able as well, but taxis are cheap and easy to find too. We thought the price was incredibly reasonable for the value we received. Included in your stay is breakfast, which was always delicious. The ""honor bar"" was a convenient touch too. We would definitely stay here again next time we are in Puerto."
50,"You walk through the gate and immediately feel a sense of calm.  Quinta is in a quiet, safe neighborhood with lots of restaurants in walking distance and when you return after a day of activity you feel like you're returning home.  I had the best sleep there!  Luis and all the staff are sweet and do everything they can to make you feel well taken care of, particularly by providing transportation from and to the airport (even if you're plane arrives 2 hours late!).  The breakfasts are delicious, authentic and homemade Mexican dishes.  Luis was available to assist with arranging activities, suggest restaurants and generally help me to navigate the town and area.  But you can easily walk to one of the most beautiful cove beaches you'll find anywhere in five minutes time. I will"
50,"Quinta is the perfect romantic beach holiday destination. Just a short walk from sheltered Playa Carrizalillo (where you can swim safely or just eat shrimp tacos and drink cold beer on the beach), the rooms and building are beautifully-designed (there's a solar-powered jacuzzi!), the breakfasts (go the Oaxacan option) are amazing, and Luis and Magda are extremely attentive and warm hosts who are always willing to provide more info about activities or short trips in the Oaxaca area. Highly, highly recommended!"
50,We just visited Quinta and had a fantastic few days in Puerto Escondido. The owner Luis is super friendly and helped us find our way around and book tours and taxis. Breakfast is served each day down by the pool and they change it up each day which is a nice touch. The hotel itself has a pool that also goes under the bridge to the front of the hotel. The room was big and clean and decorated with interesting art and objects. I'd definitely go again. Thanks for a great time!  Jonny
50,"The hotel was excellent, the bed comfortable, room clean and an amazing view from our balcony.  They upgraded us as per our email request and it was very appreciated.  The service from the front desk to the housekeeping was great and while there was a slight language barrier, nothing was missed.   The beach club was the high point for us as it was beautiful to lay there and watch the beach.   The hotel shuttle was perfect, the walk down the hill was fine but back up sometimes a wee bit too hot.  It ran right until 6:00 which suited us perfectly.  The only downfall I could see was that the doors are old style lock and key so people would slam their doors rather than use the key to lock it.   Even the construction noise wasn't bad.  It did not bother us at all and appears the"
30,"Hotel is very pretty and clean & the workers are nice.    ---Hotel is VERY NOISY with construction that is worse during the day but right now (5:15 pm) I'm hearing construction noise also. Sunday they were constantly hammering until 6 Pm. --When we booked it said breakfast was included in the price and right now, on trip advisor says ""BREAKFAST IS INCLUDED"".  We are getting charged so we asked a manager who said it's not included anymore. PLEASE CORRECT THE LISTING.  --The beach is very close (< 1mile) away, has a nice pool with lots of chairs but you need to take a taxi or the hotel shuttle (starts at 10 ends at 3pm, I think). There's also a pool in hotel courtyard -  very nice. There seems to be a beach towel shortage, couldn't get any day 1 so we are just bringing them back"
30,"Desk: not very helpful, not great attitude Bar/restaurant staff: extremely nice and friendly Breakfast: Excellent buffet choice every morning Bedrooms: OK. Sort of spartan. No chairs to sit. No shelves or closet, just a hanging bar. Room service: forgot to bring fresh towels couple days. Pool: not as large as it seems in the pics Location: Good. Away from the crowds and noice downtown. Twenty minute walk to main bay, and 15 to a most beautiful beach (Carrizalillo)"
20,"The good parts: Hotel Villasol is situated in a quiet neighbourhood outside of the slightly down at heel main strip of Playa Zicatela, about 5 minutes by plentiful & cheap taxis. There are glimpses of the Pacific from some parts of the property and the gardens and pool area are well maintained. The young staff are friendly and keen to help where they can. The beach club is located on a very nice beach & Villasol runs half hourly shuttles between the hotel and the beach club. However unfortunately there are also some not so good parts.  Its not apparent from the website but there is a very big difference in room quality between rooms without a balcony and those with. Make sure you get an upper level room with a balcony. Its very much worth the extra MXP200 per night. There are a"
50,Only complaint is no comfortable place to sit in the room.  Bed was comfortable.  The staff was very good; friendly and very helpful. That includes every one from reception to maid. Great food in the restaurant. The beach club is wonderful.  Highly recommend.  
30,"My kids had a good time since they spent most of their time at the pool. Service at the pool started great then was very slow. I think because when they got busy, the staff could not keep up. Will come back and try again"
40,"I spent 4 nights there with my family and we really rested and enjoyed it. The hotel is beautiful, all services are perfect, especially the simming pool, restaurant and beach club. It is not in the downtown but you can take a taxi, very cheap and 10 minutes to the Zicatela Beach."
40,"I stayed at the hotel the past week with 5 friends of mine. Let me tell you that I had the most pleasant stay at the hotel. It was really clean, the room had a lot of space for everyone´s luggage. It had only one bathroom and for big groups it can be a little bit uncomfortable but we did our best to try to make it work. The beach club was good, and the food also good. Anyway, if you are one of those (like me) who likes to go out and explore, let me tell you that the hotel´s location is reeeeeally good. It's like 5 mins away (by car) from the beach Carrizalillo, about 10-15 mins from Zicatela (very popular).   The service at the hotel was very good, they were really friendly. The only bad thing was that service at the restaurant took too long :(   I would definitely would"
50,"Statyed here with my friend and we had a great time! Our room was clean, the staff were friendly and even if the hotel is not located in the center irs still close to everything! My favourite part with this hotel is their beach club ! Only 2 min away with a free shuttle bus. It's located at the beach and it's beautiful ! The beach club it's a must while here!"
50,"Great Oaxacan hospitality. This hotel is located at a more residential area away from the Zicatela noisy street with a beach club, pool and outstanding food. I was traveling with my girlfriend and the experience could have not been better."
50,"The hotel is exactly what it looks like on pictures. The property is very well manicured. Walks on the beach are stunning and the food is amazing! We had a list of restaurants we wanted to try in Puerto Escondido that we never went to, because we were so impressed with the delicious cuisine in our hotel. Will defenderlo go back. "
40,"The Hotel is for couples so I felt myself lonely and lost in this paradise considering the hotel is far from everything.  The food is not that good and many few options.  The service I considered regular because the cleaning people and the pool people were insisting too much for help. Felt uncomfortable. Couldn’t read a book or relax under the sun without being bothered.  I would visit this place accompanied in other opportunity, the view is amazing and the weather is perfect.  "
30,What a site to see. Great architecture.   all looks grand  I ate in the resturant- good but expensive for Oaxaca standards. I didn't stay in the hotel as it is rally close to nowhere -- 20 miles from Puerto Escondido but worth a visit-- also next door is an art school  with very interseting buildings and pool done by the smae architect of Hotel Escondido.  If you want to hide away and stay in one spot for your vacation- this is the place.  Nice beach with next to no one on it.  Great get away place
50,"We just left Hotel Escondido after 3 days in paradise and we miss it already.   While totally off-the-grid, the hotel was easy to get to, about 30 minutes from Escondido and the airport.   The second you enter the hotel, you feel that you are staying at a one-of-a-kind place. From the design to the landscaping, everything feels like it has been thoroughly thought-through. And while incredibly artful, the whole place feels warm and welcoming.   We got in around lunch time so our room wasn’t ready when we got there. The team offered us welcome cocktails made from local Mezcal and fresh tamarind juice, which we enjoyed over a delicious Oaxacan lunch. This first meal was amazing, and from there, the kitchen never let us down.  From the breakfasts to the “snack menu” (lunch) and the"
50,Had the best experience and meals at this hotel. Highly recommend this to anyone traveling to Puerto Escondido. Each room has a private pool which is amazing and great for relaxing and privacy. I really enjoyed this place. It’s the best!!!!
50,"I did not know much about Puerto Escondido or this hotel, but it was one of the best places I have ever been. It's around 40 minutes from the airport and you have to drive down a very rustic road (avoid getting in at night). From the moment we arrived we experienced great service and our little palapa was cozy and well designed. The wait staff is very attentive and the drinks and food are fine dining caliber. We really enjoyed all the mezcal cocktails (margarita and paloma were favorites), Mexican wine, and range of Oaxacan mezcal. Every night we ordered every special and were blown away with how fresh and innovative each dish was. The beach and infinity pool are gorgeous (especially as the sun is setting). The hotel beach was a bit too rough to swim, but we took a surf lesson"
50,"Upon landing in Puerto Escondido be prepared for about a 40-minute taxi ride to the hotel, you will not be disappointed. The area is secluded and fantastic. Arrival was a breeze as our luggage was taken to our casita while we were checking in.  This hotel is very peaceful if you are looking for a loud, active nightlife this man not be the place for you.  The housing staff was very attentive to our needs. The restaurant staff, especially Erick and Arnie, went above and beyond in taking care of us.  They did an excellent job of telling us about dishes and drinks we might like to try, and they did not disappoint us.  We really liked enjoyed the mezcal with Jamaica. The casitas are incredibly private with lounge chairs, a private pool, and hammock. If you would rather be on the"
50,"This resort would be special on its merits, but its out of the way location also makes it feel off the beaten trail and therefore special in today's marketplace of cookie cutter resorts.  The standalone rooms are very location-sensitive but still luxurious, not skimping on anything.  And don't miss the amazing bio-luminescence bay tour, one of the very few in the world where you can actually still swim in these magical waters.  The great staff work to make you feel at home, and they succeeded.  "
50,Dear Etienne and the whole team at Hotel Escondido: Thank you for everything. We appreciate your efforts while staying at Hotel Escondido. We felt really welcomed - the hotel is a wonderful hidden getaway and everyone there was really helpful and accommodating to our needs. Antonio and Aries pampered us at the restaurant which exceeded our expectations - especially for a small boutique hotel like yours. We're happy to come back one day. All the best for and your team!
20,"Wonderful kitchen staff and restaurant waiters, beautiful design and views, friendly staff, BUT air conditioner did not work in 95 F heat with no repairs done during our 6 -day stay, the room was unbearably hot during the day but ok by night, insects are a problems, the beach is absolutely not swimmable, the room window  shutters are not maintained, service friendly but inconsistent. We asked 4 times for the air conditioner to be repaired and were assured it was done- of course, nothing was done but “friendly smiles and promoses” were issued with no hesitation. The place appears to be mismanaged and no attention is paid to details. For example, minibar contained open drinks, and nobody appears to supervise house keeping.  The place charges usd $300 per night and receives a lot"
50,"Staying in this quiet clean well-priced hotel so close to the ocean made our stay just perfect. Owners Paul and Joanne welcome guests and do whatever it takes to make your stay relaxed and memorable. The hotel is clean, well staffed, and safe. Joanne, who owned and managed a Toronto, Ontario, Canada, restaurant for many years, oversees very capable kitchen staff and in preparing superb dinners each night. It's the best accommodation in Escondido."
50,"A refreshing reprieve from the ""all inclusive sameness of resorts"".  From the friendly, social owners Paul and Joanne to the smiling, helpful staff, this wonderful old hotel offers a charming peaceful vacation in an exqusite setting, seconds walk to the most beautiful swimming beach, fabulous food and the roof top terrace bar and pool offer spectacular sunsets.  The quaint setting, friendly locals, palapas beach bars (Lisa's Bar and her exotic birds, and Brad's Split Coconut where we enjoyed the  Blues Festival) provides an oasis of activities, sights and fun.  What a wonderful place!  One of the best holidays ever.  Linda Urquhart"
50,"We stayed at the ""Flor"" last week, and we found that the welcome by Paul and Joanne was absolutely fantastic.  Felt ""at home"" at the front desk. The room was clean, and the beds were comfortable. Balcony was small, but great to have a door that opens. The rooftop pool and bar was a great place to spend some quiet time and enjoy the view of the bay and a great breeze. Restaurant was excellent....Try the Shrimp in Garlic...... Will return to this hotel when we return to Puerto Escondido Many thanks, Paul and Joanne"
50,"You can't ask for much more.  Simple full service rooms with comfortable beds, fans, good bathrooms, a 30 second walk to the beach (but enough off the beach to give you a feeling of being set-back), the best restaurant in Puerto Escondido, charming under-stated Mexican decor (yes, there is such a thing) and friendly hosts who are Canadian, European, and Mexican all at the same time. You can walk to town, to the world famous Mexican Pipeline to watch the surfers, or to any of several local beaches, either Playa Marinera or Bahia Principale in front of the hotel or two minutes to the Zicatela, or ten minutes to Carrizalilla or Manzanilla. We have trailed on all continents and would recommend Flor de Maria highly on any standard"
50,"I was incredibly relieved to find this place - when I first landed in Puerto I stayed at an absolute dump in El Adoquin. Flor de Maria is tucked away at the Playa Marinero end of the main beach -  the cleanest place to swim. Its a 30 second walk from the beach, and a great place to stay if you want to relax away from the tacky bustle of backpackers at Zicatela. The hosts are unbelievably helpful. The hotel itself has a restaurant with cheap, delicious food, as well as a terrace on the roof with hammocks, a swimming pool and a bar overlooking the beach. I spent many an afternoon swinging in a hammocks reading books borrowed from their library. The rooms are spacious and very cute, too. I had a wonderful stay here - highly reccommended."
50,"We traveled during the last week of November....a very slow time with few tourists.   We were trying to decide between Quinta Lili and Flor de Maria.  We are so happy we stayed at Flor de Maria.  Quinta Lili is far from  the center and a lot of the activities ...and the walk from the nearest beach can be daunting....75 steps straight up.    Flor de Maria is within a block of  the main beach and we could walk to Zicatella beach easily.  The sunsets from the rooftop bar are worth the stay.  We were there during a quiet time so there was no one ""hogging"" the chairs --- no old codgers in the hammocks.  The hosts were very friendly and helpful.  The rooms very large.  We had a room with 2 double beds and a balcony which gave us lots of light.  Liked the restaurant too.  Our breakfast"
50,"This charming, Canadian-run hotel is on a quiet street just steps from a wide, sandy beach. The hotel has a Mexican 1940s art deco feel to the place. The Crown jewel is the restaurant, which is the best in Puerto Escondido and tends to offer more European than Mexican fare. Joanne, one of the hotel's owners, is the chef. Her husband Paul is the front desk man. They are fabulous hosts. The rooms are spacious although there is no air-conditioning so fans are necessary to keep the temperature down. There is a rooftop pool surrounded by a large deck overlooking the ocean. A perfect place for lounging in the afternoon and having a sunset cocktail."
50,"We have been coming to PE for about 7 years,  always staying at Flor de Maria. What a wonderful place! Situated between 2 different beaches with a fabulous restaurant, maybe the best in town. Everyone here is warm and inviting. We love coming here."
40,"We fell into Flor de Maria, unexpecting and found the most wonderful oasis.  Lovely staff, comfortable rooms, great location and fabulous roof-top pool from where we could watch the sunrise and sunset, along with family, friends, and anyone who wanted to join.  Don't miss it.  Great local flavor yet a notch above ""local""."
40,"Flor de Maria is a small hotel owned by a Canadian couple (as far as I understood) - very kind people. The wife rules the kitchen with very much success - tourists from other hotels very often eat there. All prices are modest. The hotel´s interior is charming with a lot of wall-paintings, a terasse with a splendid view to the ocean, and it is very near to a fine beach. If you like fishing the possibilities are great. I caught a dorado on 150 cm, a yellow finned tuna o 100 cm and another, unknown fish of the same size. It was a great pleasure that we a lot of the time were surrounded by scores of dolphins that jumped meters above the sea. And on our way back to the shore we saw at least hundred turtles. 14 km away from the hotel you have the Manialtepec Lagoon - a fantastic"
40,"nice and clean room, nice pool, good location and EXCLENT food. would go there again for sure :)"
50,"We were very sad when we left after five fantastic nights here. Beautiful updated rooms, treehouse like hotel, hanging pots and flowers everywhere. Lovely clean pool, and nice restaurant with fantastic service. Hotel is right across from the beach and close to Okko, more restaurants and shops. Will come back!"
50,"very good location, clean pool, very good food, and the stuff are great"
50,"We normally stay at Bunglows Zicatela, but on this occasion, they announced they do not allow pets. Our Chihuahua -Sushi had stayed with us every other visit, but we were put back on the street looking for a new place. The third hotel down the road let us all stay in a great room facing the beach for 700 pesos.  The owner/manager was very decent and said that because it was low season, she would let us have our pet. I think, if you were here even in the high season, she'd let you have your pet too."
40,"We had a double room with bathroom for only 380 pesos. We had a fan and not aircon and it did get a bit hot! The pool and bar were perfect and the staff were really friendly. Less than a minute walk from the hotel is the beach, which you can see while in the pool. The whole place was beautiful!"
50,"beach front, clean grounds, clean hotel, well run, we loved it there, easy walk to everything  in  escondido"
50,"friendly, very very clean, great pool area with bar & hammocks & beds & shade, value for money and good food!  will be back for sure"
50,"Hotel Ines is a gem!  It's located across from world class surf.  It has a number of clean rooms at various prices.  The new pool area has wifi, a bar/restaurant, and a very friendly multilingual staff.  I highly recommend this hotel for couples, surfers, and families."
40,"My husband, 17 year old son and I stayed for two weeks at the BHI and we loved it. It has the best location on Zicatela; there are several choices for rooms that can fit any budget and the food is great. We are from Canada and have travelled extensively as a family. If you are looking to relax on a hammock, drink an ice cold beer and eat fresh guacamole with warm tortilla chips, then this is the place I recommend. I am a vegetarian, but my husband said the Filet Mignon was mouthwatering. We ate at several locations (Benditos - great pizza & pasta; Sativa - amazing coconut shrimp; El Cafecito - best breakfasts) but whenever we needed some comfort food with no surprises; we ate at the BHI Restaurante Bar.   The rooms are clean and linens are crisp but there are occasional moments"
40,Popular hotel in the middle of zicatela beach. Not the best pool area of hotels we saw as not enough loungers or space. Rooms clean and well protected with mosquito screens. Bathrooms a little tired but good hot water. Good value for location and friendly helpful service. In January hotel is popular with older Americans.
50,"This hotel had staff that look out for us and after us, though the front desk staff had almost no English. The rooms were clean and simple and the food was excellent, though limited choices at each meal.   Travel agents Miriam, Gregory and Daniel who worked for Pascon, greeted us and translated when necessary, booked and took us on our tours."
40,"We just returned from two weeks at the Posada Real and were sad to leave. However, this is a bit of a difficult hotel to review as we loved certain aspects but had a couple of disappointments. The good is that our room was modern and well maintained, anything that went wrong was fixed immediately, housekeeping was spotless, staff were mostly great, the beach is beautiful and we loved that it’s a quiet, peaceful place with no late parties or loud music at all hours as we’ve experienced elsewhere in Mexico. The weather in Puerto Escondido is fantastic! One disappointment was being given a bottom floor room looking out on the lawn when we had paid several hundred dollars extra for a superior, ocean view, balcony room. However, after some discussion with the front desk we were moved"
50,"This is a great property.  It is small and homey and the staff is excellent.  I would suggest getting a room with a balcony it is an upgrade but the view is fantastic.  Yes the view, at sun down from the lawn is wonderful, get yourself a drink and enjoy it.   The beach club is good the pool is clean, it was never crowded, no towel game or chair game the beach is long and sparsely populated. The ocean is rough but not dangerous. There are lots of beaches around to go to but this is the most quite, the others are good but many more tourists.   The breakfast is good, egg station and rolls toast, beans, tortillas and sauce fresh fruit and fresh juice. The lunch at the beach is good, hamburgers, tacos and the like. I would suggest if you want a hamburger or club sandwich to order it"
40,"Everyone was terrific, all the staff was amazing, polite and friendly. All  needs or requests were attended to and felt extremely welcome by all. The community & area is beautiful and the people are very friendly. Room was reno'd and very nice, clean and fresh. Only issue was a slight sewer smell from bathroom and there was a smoking room which had an odor and the smoke smell from next room was strong, We attempted to rectify this with a towel between adjoining door. Spoke to the front desk about this but there was not much they could do,did not really want to move, lesson learned, request no smoking! The food was good and wait staff was great, Eduardo was great and was treated very well. After a few days it was a bit plain but always good. Overall would stay at this facility"
40,"We just got back from a very enjoyable 2 week stay at the Posada Real.  What started out as a major disappointment, quickly changed and we will likely return.  We arrived at the PR about 6:30pm.  We hadn't eaten all day and were looking forward to getting some dinner.  Well, there was no one in the restaurant and the bar was closed.  We went up to our room and it was like a dorm - small, no balcony, no refrigerator, no safe, lots of TV channels (in Spanish), pillows like sandbags and noisy neighbours.  Oh dear and we're here for two weeks.  We later found the restaurant opened for dinner at 7pm. There were only a dozen people there and the food selection was very limited. There was no music, entertainment or anything to do.  We could hear the beach but we couldn't' see it.  We"
40,"Excellent value in a small resort. Beach Club is beautiful with lots of Palapas and beach chairs - no worries about rushing to save a spot and lots of towels (with no hassle or threats!). We were all inclusive so it was well worth the small extra to get a room with balcony, beautiful view of ocean and sunsets. All the rooms are recently modernized with truly excellent (quiet) air conditioning. We swam laps every morning in the Hotel pool and walked both ways to the Beach club - really only 5 minutes. Food was great quality with reasonable selection for a small resort, we were there 11 days so went out for dinner twice, cabs are easy to get and there is a good selection of restaurants very close by. The Resort is very well maintained with lots of happy and efficient staff."
40,"Arriving at Huatulco airport is followed by a two hour van ride down a winding road as we came to this resort as a package with sunwing. The driver gave information on the area and drove carefully which I appreciated. Check in was a bit confused , a group of travel agents had arrived as a fam trip. Front desk was friendly with passable English Although we thought the resort would be rustic Mexican we were surprised to find the room was a modern design after having been renovated, this may be more appealing to some people. There was two double beds in most rooms and they were quite comfortable. The air conditioner was the new design sitting high on the wall. It ran quietly and worked well. The shower was the modern glass enclosed design with plenty if hot water. Our room had an"
40,"Whent to Puerto Escandido to surf the big waves and I loved that hotel, basic but nice all inclusive, minutes from Playa Zicatela!!   Best place not to expensive. Super view and super sevice!!!  Will go back next year for sure."
40,"We had been to Huatulco many times but this was our first time in Puerto Escondido.  We just wanted to see something a bit different.  We got in late Saturday afternoon after about a two hour shuttle ride (the first part of the ride is a bit hairy by the way) and checked in quickly.  It has more of a hotel feel to it as opposed to a resort, but the rooms were fine and it was clean.  There is no in room safe but there are lockboxes that require a two key entry at the front desk and it was fine and possibly more secure than some of the in room safes at other places.  We really keep to ourselves when we travel and feel no need to be pampered by anyone. That being said, the staff was friendly and attentive.    We did not do the full all inclusive based on other reviews so I can't"
50,"We have been here for a heavenly ten days and will find it tough to leave shortly. Simply put, it is a great little hotel. We never tire of its  laid back charm, stunning location, professional and warm staff, brilliant beach club, excellent food and fine tour service Pascon Travel. The management of the staff is encouraging and supportive and these fine people, who do not always speak much English are as helpful and supportive as possible. A very friendly environmen.to say the least -like being home. We have enjoyed all of the changing buffets and some particularly tasty Mexican and Oaxaca specialties. The bartenders and wait staff are flriendly and efficient. Special thanks to Vladimir, Oliver, Erick and Carlos who introduced us to the Mescallin! The pools are clean and"
10,"What you get is a room with bed, ceiling fan and basin plus private bath.  Noise from other rooms and from guests outside their rooms. Poor value as charged in dollars instead of pesos, which I believe is against the law. Small pool. Poor value. Maybe good for geriatric backpackers.  Very poor value. Hot with no ocean breeze."
50,"We spent two very relaxing weeks at  this lovely hotel and we hope to return. Very quiet and  and just  1/2 block to beach and great restaurants. We had a room on the main level and then moved to 2nd floor. There is a main courtyard communal area on the 1st floor , found 2nd better for me as it was a bit quieter - but no issues with noise at anytime during our stay. Rooms have fans , no air con but the fans do a good job.we did use a portable fan for the back patio for a couple of days until we got more used to the heat. The rooms are thoroughly cleaned everyday as well as communal kitchen and sitting areas, the two ladies that clean do an amazing job. The owners live on site and are available for any assistance or advice .they have a lovely dog and 3 social cats that would"
50,"We had a great experience at Hotelito Swiss Oasis, and we spent eight nights there, not one. Manuela and Rene are gracious hoteliers, whose information and tips made the visit to P.E. better. The room was great, with a balcony on the backside that did, yes!, look over into a neighbor's backyard, but we rarely saw anyone there. The other window looked out over the beautiful pool.  The bed was the best bed I have ever slept in, huge king size, and perfectly firm. The sheets were soft and light. The shower was great.  The room was cleaned every day. The common kitchen was convenient, with a fridge and countertop gas burner. All the guests looked after their own activity, and it was always clean. Lots of free amenities like shampoo, lotions, fruit, popcorn, hats, etc.  Excellent"
50,"The Hotelito Swiss Oasis is my new favorite place to stay in Puerto! I have stayed at several other hotels in the area but from now on I will stay at the Swiss Oasis. The hosts are wonderfully accommodating and knowledgable about the area. We loved the scooter rental, the pool and the rooms. Everything was clean, quite and beautiful.  My partner and I highly recommend the Swiss Hotel. "
20,"We can understand the raves about the welcome, the little extras, and the artistic touches. But much is missing. The ""pool"" is barely large enough for a dip. The room was small, with no closet, and no chairs because there was no room for them. There was no air conditioning--ridiculous in this climate and at the price we paid--and the fan wasn't enough to cool the air or keep mosquitoes at bay. The back balcony of our room looked out on a neighbor's work yard.   Worst, perhaps, is the layout, so that loud guests who talk across the patio into the night send every word into the rooms above. A polite word was not enough to still them, and the owners had melted away.   A comfortable night is available nearby for the same price, but if you need the other assets of this hotel, it's"
50,"I would love to give an informative review but what can I say that over 200 other reviewers haven't already said. We had a great time at Hotelito Swiss Oasis and as the name suggests it is an Oasis where you can get off the street and relax, all day if you like. If a small quiet place steps away from the restaurants and bars and 1/2 block from the beach is your cup of tea, you will like it here. I need to give some props to the two ladies who clean the rooms, they are great and do a fantastic job on your room everyday. As has been said over and over, the proprieters are fantastic and hearing Mauela flip from English to Spanish to French to German without missing a beat is an experience in itself. Another thing that must be said is regarding the lack of AC. Having experienced the"
50,"  Great place,only 8 rooms so very quaint. Beautiful pool and courtyard shaded by palm trees and manicured foliage. Close to everything you need. The best pillow I've ever had in Mexico. No kids is I nice touch since we left ours at home. "
50,"My friend and I spent nine nights at Hotelito Swiss Oasis over the New Year's holiday. We had a wonderful stay thanks to the hospitality of Manuela, the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms, the tranquil, peaceful setting provided by the pool and grounds, and the general sense of staying in a true oasis away from the front street of Zicatella. This was our second time in Puerto; during our first, we stayed in a much larger, busier hotel on the main drag. Hotelito was a wonderful compromise as it was mere yards from the street, the shopping, the restaurants and the beach, yet still gave us a quiet place to spend our days and evenings when we felt like having some peacefulness. The hotel had man charming amenities, like the ceiling fans, room patios, clean toilet facilities, and a"
50,"This hotel was exactly what we wanted: A quiet place to relax for two weeks. Manuela and Rene could write a great book on hospitality! We felt like a part of the family, they shared tips on the best restaurants, surf guide and activities. The hotel is perfectly clean and in a great location in the middle of Zicatela. We are excited to return in the future!"
40,"Hotelito may not have an ocean view (a mere 3 minute walk away), but  this small sweet hotel has been well thought out.  From the ample hooks for hanging clothes, towels etc to the good ceiling fan in our room (with comfy king sized bed), to the lovely pool and landscaping in the courtyard complete with hammocks and communal kitchen, hats, snorkel gear, and sunscreen available for all guests.  Manuela is very approachable.  We appreciated her connecting us with a great surf instructor.  Ava kept everything really clean.  We loved our stay and hope to return!  Muchas gracias para todo, Hotelito Swiss Oasis!"
40,"A fascinating proprietor who made the leisurely, enormous breakfasts 'with conversation' a real part of the holiday experience.  He and his staff helped us find our way around the local area and the views along the beach from our penthouse apartment were breathtaking."
50,"I actually visited the Hotel Tabachin twice during the same trip, about a week apart.  I liked the hotel so much, I stayed there again upon my return.  The hotel has a charming and colorful tile exterior and the rooms are spacious and comfortable.  The proprietor, Paul Cleaver, is a very gracious host.  He takes personal interest in his guests and is quite engaging, being more than willing to converse and to share experiences of mutual interest.  The breakfasts are splendid, truly living up to their reputation as the best in Puerto Escondido.  The Tabachin is also very conveniently located, only a block from the beach and the interesting Zicatela area.  - Arthur"
50,"We just got back from an 11 day stay at the Tabachin-- we had planned to visit elsewhere but the Tabachin was so perfect for our family that we couldn't be bothered! First, it is on a small point with Zicatela (Mexico's Pipeline-size wave) to the left and Playa Marinero, with perfect boogie-boarding waves 2 minutes fro the hotel and water safe enough for a 5 year old. Next, the Tabachin itself is truly wonderful--Paul the owner set up the kitchens (with all you need plus thoughtful extras like blenders and microwave ovens). The staff is truly lovely; Felix the day manager speaks fluent English and is truly hospitable, while Rocio and the rest of the gang couldn't be sweeter. The room is nicely furnished with large balconies overlooking the ocean. The observation deck on the top"
50,"Traveled to Puerto Escondido with 3 other girlfriends and we were taken back by how wonderful this seemingly simple hotel was.  The truly humble and joyful staff, including the owner, Paul, take great pride in caring for their guests and making sure that you thoroughly enjoy your time in Puerto.   Would highly recommend to anyone heading to Puerto!"
50,"The owner, Paul Cleaver, at one point said, ""You know, we have had 11 email exchanges."" That just about tells you all you need to know about how absolutely patient and kind this man was as our travel plans were on and off due to the flu scare. I can't say enough about this place. Spacious, great location, amazing breakfast, great staff and enough charm to make it all worthwhile. We took all Paul's suggestions: where to eat, where to go to the beach, etc., to our great benefit. The hospitality was fantastic without being overdone. This is the kind of place you could settle on as your beach destination for a couple of weeks every year."
30,"We spent 4 nights at Tabachin. We booked one of their penthouses and we can guarantee you that the top unit has the best view of Zicatela beach. We don't surf so we realized that the location of the place may not have been the best. The owner Paul was very nice and entertained us daily with Mexican History lessons. The rooms could use some updating especially the AC unit. Breakfast is included and the selection will find everybody happy and satisfied. Just FYI, apparently the credit card machine does not always work so be ready to be asked to take a credit card cash advance or come prepared with enough cash or traveler's checks. Otherwise, make sure that you ask Paul before  you arrive. Overall a good value for what is offered... One last thing thoug! If you have Verizon"
50,"I highly recommend this boutique apartment hotel. I stayed in one of the studio apartments in this lovely hotel behind the Santa Fe Hotel and a block from Zicatela Beach. The owner, Paul Cleaver, is a charming host. The extensive and delicious breakfast served in the courtyard attracts others in the community. In addition to the guests, we are treated to a continuing array of interesting people and discussion. The apartments are clean, comfortable, and fully equipped, offering a stove, microwave, fridge, in-room safe, TV and phone. I think it’s the best deal in P.E. I’m a single, older woman, traveling alone and couldn’t have felt more comfortable and safe here."
50,"I just got back from Puerto Escondido for the first time last night and I stayed at the Tabachin, located behind the Santé Fe Hotel on the main street, this hotel is clean, nice, and functional for anyone, just not people looking for a hostel type or on a serious budget. My group was three guys that wanted to surf, go out, and be close to everything. Tabachin nailed it for us. We walked to Mex Pipe everyday after a huge homemade breakfast from Don Paul's staff. We stumbled home after long nights at the local drinking spots on the beach without any problems and we were easy to find for our taxis, etc...No pool, but it turned out ok anyways. Very affordable when you figure in the homemade breakfast menu, wireless web, sky TV, room cleaning everyday, pumping A/C units, surf look"
50,"This is such an amazing place to stay. The room we stayed in was HUGE, had an amazing balcony, wonderful wood work... it felt like the kind of place Hemingway or Bukowski would be fond of. It's right next to the main drag on Zicatela Beach, but not on the drag, which is a good thing in my book (You don't always want to party). If someone gave me $1,000,000 dollars and said ""Open up your dream hotel in Puerto Escondido"" I can't imagine it look much different than the Tabachin. Oh, and the breakfast is the best in town, by far, I'm talking like outer orbit far, seriously, it's really rather good.   If you don't stay here I can only assume you have some sort of  phobia of beautifully unique, inspired and amazing hotels. In which case I would advise you to seek immediate psychiatric"
50,"WOW ! Room was beautiful, breakfast is memorable, hospitality plus"
50,"What a lovely place!  We had only planned to stay a couple nights before moving to another area of town, but we enjoyed the environment at the Villa and the neighborhood so much that we ended up staying there our entire visit in Puerto Escondido.    The location was wonderful - super close to Playa Carrizalillo (wonderful for swimming, and depending on the waves, good for beginning surfers with boards rented at the beach), and slightly further but still walking distance to Playa Puerto and Manzanillo (also great for swimming).  It was a super chill area of town and very safe feeling, and only a few blocks from several very good restaurants that ranged from upscale to casual.  There was even a wonderful ice cream/popsicle shop right around the corner.  The property was lovely and"
50,"We booked this hotel last minute as our plans to board a bus failed because it was full. We called them 9oclock at night and she(Ivana)willingly came out of her  way to meet us and check us in. Everyone was so kind and welcoming. The rooms and entire compound were EXACtLY what i look for in an exotic and beautiful place like Puerto Escondido. Pricing was very reasonable for such a magical, enchanting atmosphere. I will definitely be back!! "
40,"we stayed here in th garden room which was spacious and clean as well as having all the modern facilities and gadgets. The owners are thoughtful and considerate and made our welcome warm and breakfast in the garden was typical and traditional which we loved. I found a local bar to watch the footbal and was joined by the owner who is german with a mexican wife so a well balanced team. The beaches close by are raw, natural and fun with local restaurants and fisherman willing to share their catch which the restaurants will cook while you enjoy a cocktail!!!! We arrived by small plane from Oaxaca which was special and with Puerto Escondido and Oaxaca you have the best of Mexico. I would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend it for a real taste of this fascinating area and"
40,"These B&B is really well located in a walking distance from Carizalillo bay and the comercial area of restaurants. The gardens are really nice, the staff and owner really sweet. I hated the pillows of peer bungalow that will be my biggest complain and not having a pool. "
50,"If you are looking for an idyllic place to stay in Puerto Escondido, then Villa Mozart y Macondo is your spot!    I am a solo, female traveller and my requirements for accommodations were cleanliness, close to a body of water, cute/quaint, quiet, and reasonably priced.  Villa Mozart exceeded all of my expectations.  So much so that I extended my stay from 3 nights to 4 and then 6!  (Being that I was a first time solo traveler and first time PE visitor, I was a bit indecisive on where to stay.  I booked a few nights at a Hotel Paradaiso because it had a pool, but it was a DISASTER.  Filthy rooms and super crowded and not in a great location.  I went RUNNING back to Villa Mozart.)  Upon my arrival, I was greeted by Emilio who helps manage the property.  He was the SWEETEST and"
50,"Villa Mozart was a dream! Staff were friendly as soon as we arrived. Even without a reservation, we were greeted with warmth and they accommodated us for one out of the two nights we stayed in Puerto Escondido. Playa Carrizalillo, which is a 5 minute walk away, was the perfect retreat - not too busy with easy waves for swimming & surfing (for beginners). Also, the hotel's garden with hammocks, sculptures and library (with books in many languages) was a nice escape from the hot afternoon sun."
50,"We stayed for 7 days (March 8-14) -- it was so beautiful, clean, quiet and restful that we didn’t want to leave, ever!  The hotel is situated on  a very quiet street, the nights were so quiet and calming, we slept very well every night.    The hotel has furnished bungalows with hammocks outside, large private bathrooms, lots of space inside, much original artwork and a cheery atmosphere.  However, we stayed in the smallest room, with a shared bathroom, both of which were immaculately clean. The room has a fan, a large comfortable bed, and beautiful original artwork on the walls.  The bathroom was cleaned frequently, I noticed that it was cleaned often during the day after it had been used, so it was always immaculate.    The hotel has a lush green garden and contrasting red"
50,"The warm and inviting atmosphere at this unique location is wonderful. Located in Rinconada, near to a mix of restaurants and close walking distance to a swimmable beach, this place is ideal for a relaxing vacation with great breakfasts and a garden filled with sculptures. It is a short easy taxi ride from the hubbub of the  surfer's beach in Zicatela.   "
50,"This small hotel consists of a few nice bungalows set in a lovely garden decorated with whimsical carvings and art works.  It's away from the main part of town but close to a street with some very good restaurants.  Also close to a good surfing & swimming beach, though you have to climb a fairly long stair up & down to access the beach.  Wifi but no air conditioning, hot water or pool.  High speed fan in the room & hammocks outside in the garden.  A small restaurant for on-site breakfasts but also plenty of options on the next street."
50,"Behind the Villa Mozart, attached to it by a charming garden, is the restaurant Tololote. I believe it serves only breakfast, and only a few choices- fruit ( the best I've ever tasted ) and yoghurt; eggs with crispy bacon, absolutely great bread and jams- and endless cups of great local coffee. ( there are more choices but that's as far as I've eaten! ) Service is prompt and impeccable; the servers are pretty and friendly. All for 80 pesos- so good! It's cool in the shade, surrounded by plants... I assume if you stay at the Mozart you can access Tololote through the villa, but as we stay elsewhere we enter from the road paralleling Benito Juarez. Highly recommended!"
50,"I highly recommend this villa. The personnel is at your service and is very kind.  You can feel at home, not like in big hotels. The decoration is very nice and the owner can advise you a perfect restaurant close to the hotel, she also speaks english very well."
50,"We just came back from a week stay at Villa Lili. My sister and I joined our brother and sister-in- law for a mini reunion. Wow, what a great choice for us. Our rooms on the 2nd floor were spacious and airy and so clean. Our balcony overlooked the pools (pretty and refreshing), the bar (adorned with an outrageous collection of orchids tended by the fascinating Adelina, owner of Villa Lili) and the outdoor kitchen (where Irene performed her magic every morning preparing the most delicious breakfasts). The property is kept spotlessly clean by Silvia and Irene. Villa Lili is in the Rinconada neighborhood; walk 2 blocks down the hill to restaurants, grocery, hardware, amazing gelato, coffee, bakery, craft beer store, and the entry path to a lovely beach. One notable feature of"
50,"I have stayed at several different hotels in Puerto and without doubt I would recommend Villa Lili and its sister hotel as the best. Closest to my favorite beach in the town, the space is relaxing and well appointed. The hotel is very clean and Adelina and her staff are super friendly and accommodating. Breakfast is made for you and is something different every day depending on what is fresh at the market. All the rooms I have stayed in have had a beautiful sea view. Wifi is also excellent."
50,"We spent 4 days at Villa Lili with our 2-year-old daughter and had wonderful time. Villa Lili is comfortable, quiet and located in the not-so-touristy part of Puerto Escondito. Adelina is a great host and her staff are super nice and friendly. The freshly cooked breakfasts of local specialties are a treat! We had the best recommendations for things to do, places to eat and kind-friendly beaches. We would love to go back."
50,"Great place with the best people in Puerto, Adelina you are the best host ever. Stayed in Villa for few days but I really enjoyed myself. The place has great access to the airport and most importantly to wonderful beaches. Definitely Im coming back soon and do recommend the place for anyone looking to relax and enjoy the real Puerto Escondido."
50,"Villa Lili is a charming boutique hotel in the quieter side of Puerto Escondido. It has quick access to  a great surfing beach, quality restaurants and convenient stores. The service at Puerto Escondido is unparalleled. We had a variety of authentic local breakfast prepared daily by Irene, personalized excursions facilitated by Adelina and Alex and recommendations to their favorite sites/restaurants. Our kids enjoyed the hot tub, balcony and spacious open room layout. At the end of our 7-day stay, we felt like family - Alex even drove us to the airport!"
50,"What a wonderful stay at Villa Lili.  We were picked up at the airport and whisked away to the beautiful guest house.  We stayed in the bedroom on the top floor (had a private hot tub).  The daily breakfast cooked and served by Silvia was the highlight every morning before surfing.  Adelina was an incredible, knowledgeable host and very pleasant to converse with.  Great stay, thank you for the wonderful vacation!"
40,"Thanks for having us guys you were so fun and friendly! Breaky was always delicious, the rooms clean and comfortable , and the pool A great way to cool off!! Adelina you are the perfect host! Tours booked for us and even drove us to the bus stop when we left. So lovely! "
50,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Villa Lilli, the hosts were super friendly and the room was well presented. I loved the mosaic detail which made it all part of the Mexican experience. The breakfasts were so tasty and varied every morning, there were a lot of vegetarian options which I was really happy about. The pool was very refreshing and great to have the cooler jacuzzi next to the lap pool. Thank you for being such wonderful and helpful hosts, we loved every minute of it."
50,"We stayed here for a week on our honeymoon through Central America and couldn't have been happier. Carrizalillo beach is fantastic and it is good to be a little way from Zicatela, $2 cab ride away. The hosts were great to us and even offered us a free nights Accom when we were left stranded by an airline muckup, which we didn't take but the offer was very kind."
50,"We stayed there for some days and it was amazing! The staff and the new owners are friendly and nice. The Hostel is clean and secure.The closes beach is 10 walking minutes away, but you can rent a bike to come around in town. Great Hostel and a cozy atmosphere."
50,"Really enjoyed my stay at Tower bridge, and met some great people. The owners are lovely and make the effort to get to know all the guests personally, which is really rare in the backpacker world, and the whole place has a really chilled out vibe. It's has a really relaxed feel unlike most hostels, and feels quite similar to a lot of places I've stayed in around South East Asia. Bar sells cheap beers, the restaurant at night does tasty snacks, and the pool is great to cool off during the day. Only 20-30pesos in a taxi to all the local beaches as well, will definitely be coming back here one day 👍🏻😊"
50,"I get the feeling that under former management, that this place was a bit of dump.   Now it is one of the best hostels I've stayed at: it's clean, secure (I needed to unlock two padlocks to get to my room), and the clientele are fun but without behaving like a frat party.   There are so many people working and volunteering around the hostel that it really feels like a labor of love.   The new owners, a German couple, are two of the loveliest people I've met.   Trip Advisor should get rid of the reviews that are older than a year.  It isn't the same place at all."
50,"Great place to stay and meet people. It's cheap even in busy days. The staff have always a recommendation and the manager it's very kind. You can visit many places while staying here. Don't miss Carrizalillo, Puerto Angel and Bacocho beaches. "
30,"This hostel is a fun place to stay in while in Puerto but it's no where near the beach and it's a bit run down. The staff is great and the hostel has plenty of activities like pools, pool, darts, etc but it all comes with plenty of wear and tear. Average basic rooms."
50,"We were supposed to stay 3 days, we stayed 10. we had a huge double room with private bathroom (guys i want the same when i will be back!) the ambiance is very friendly, the pool is refreshing, the coktails are awesome ! I was glad to celebrate my birthday there, they make me feel like family :) we could have stay there few months or even for ever!  see you soon !!"
50,"Initially intended to stay a night or two and ended up doing seven. The price is so much cheaper than anywhere else we had stayed with all the same amenities. Kitchen and utensils are not amazingly clean but completely usable. Everyone was friendly from the minute we got there and we all drank together every night. The cocktails are crafted by a wizard and i miss the dirty mother dearly. The location is great for the beach, for surf lessons and good restaurants. Highly recommended, there is even a free pool table.     "
50,"This hostel is amazing! I met a lot of really nice people here and the personnal is lovely! We were always having a lot of fun, most of all at the hostels bar from 7pm till midnight. They have everything you want or need! A Pool table, a kitchen, a bar, a pool and comfy beds. I suggest it to anyone whos looking forward to having fun!"
50,"We had a great time at this place. The common areas of the hostel (the pool and the bar) are great and are really conducive to meeting other people. We had a great time drinking at the bar with other backpackers before going out together to the bars on Zicatela. The dorms are big communal dorms. You don't come here for the beds, you come here for the party. Will definitely be back here if we come back to Puerto Escondido."
10,"The property is not a resort. Let’s start with that.  It’s a bunch of private condominiums that are managed as a resort. If you’re planning on using WiFi at any point in your trip - RUN AWAY. The internet here is practically not existent. At <3mbps you’ll be lucky if a few of your emails loads. Most areas outside of the lobby have no WiFi and no cel signal.   There is also a tremendous amount of deferred maintenance at the property. You can see this from the flaking  mirrors, yellow/stained towels, etc. We stayed at a penthouse suite and the problems were all over the place. The view is nice but the rooms are not well cared for. All in all, for the price I’d look somewhere else like Hotel Escondido. Bottom line, stay away.   If you’re a property owner here. I highly suggest you"
30,"A really nice place for vacation, clean and safe, incl. direct access to a clean and beautiful beach. Personal for service was missing, the remain personal made a great job but not all could be covered. Lots of pandemic rules was no easy to implement (face mask near to the pool but inside not). Cleaning of the flats was suspended. Internet service very poor."
10,"We made the mistake of making a non-refundable reservation for April 2020.  When hotels shut down because of the Covid pandemic, Vivo Resorts refused to refund the price we had paid or offer us alternative post-pandemic dates.  Of course our reservation was ""non-refundable,"" but under the circumstances of the pandemic, they should have at least offered us future accommodation for the price we had already paid.  These people are dishonest as hell."
50,"This resort has it all-except too many people.  Staff is top notch, food & beverage are fabulous and the views are spectacular!  We were in #132 and awoke to ocean views from our master bedroom, living & dining room and kitchen."
30,"This is overall a great place in the middle of nowhere, and that is what attracted us. It is not a Cancún, Puerto Vallarta type hotel zone. Rooms, facilities and amenities are pretty good, but gym equipment does need some upgrading. Yoga and fitness classes are great. Main Restaurant is a work in progress it seems. Service and portions are inconsistent. You can order from a menu, but choices are limited we found. At times their is a buffet, but why would I pay approx. 30$ Can., so we shuttled into Puerto with friends instead. People (owners and workers) here are very friendly and helpful.  At first, we decided to use the family pool for a couple of days since we were staying nearby, but, realized it can get very loud and noisy with more kids and music around. Wanted  to enjoy"
20,"The building is great, rooms are fine and clean, service is kind and food is acceptable.  But this is absolutely not a recommended place to stay if you are expecting a 5* hotel: - Air conditionning malfunctionning, solved 4-5 hours late leaving us with a 35C room during this time, midday  - wifi slow or not working - TV not working when we arrived - no hair dryer available, even if asked - extremely dirty curtains, full of stains - broken ironing board, solved after 2-3 hours complaining - No AMEX accepted for arriving credit-voucher - poor check in and check out experience"
30,"Vivo resort is first class but you could be at one of the big hotels on Miami Beach.   the Hotel is located about   10 miles from the center of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca.   Northwest of the town of  Chila a very Mexican little town Which goes to sleep at dark.  A trip from the hotel into the city of Puerto is a major event getting one of the hotel buses or a cab.  It is a winding narrow two lane road— one best not to drive at night.    Everything is provide for at vivo— swimming pools. Restaurants;   but it is very much a tourist hotel with many full time residents who have purchased a condo.     Not much of the Oaxaca Mexican culture at the hotel. the fun and interesting Mexican town of Puerto Escondido is a gem with lots of great places to eat— a couple super Mercados— local"
20,"We had visited the resort once before from Puerto Escondido to get a tour and thought we would stay here for a week so we rented a two bedroom place with our cousins. We knew it was in the middle of nowhere, but were prepared for that. On arrival, the staff did treat us very well. The rental was not good. Whenever we have rented a place where you can cook, there are the basics there and you replace what you use. In this place there was nothing, not even salt and pepper! Pretty shocking. The toilet was leaking in the master bedroom, and we discovered later that afternoon that there was not any hot water. This shows how poorly managed the place is. Both were fixed by the afternoon of the following day. We never did get any english tv even though we asked for it to be fixed several"
50,"We arrived via airport shuttle to very friendly and helpful bellhop. The rooms are extremely beautiful and feature huge sliding window panels, patio, full kitchen, washer/dryer, living room, spacious bedrooms and excellent A/C delivery.  Detail-oriented housekeeping takes a while to clean your room but the wait is worth how spic and span the suite is.  Go see Mike at front desk to hook you up with very affordable tours, i recommend the lagoon tour, it is a beautiful boat ride for birdwatching, suntanning and a delicious lunch after.  Go see Oscar at the swim up bar, he makes the best Pina Coladas.  Dont feel like leaving the resort? Check out the activities with the fine resort staff who provide kid's corner club, spanish lessons, latin dancing lessons, zumba, auqa aerobics, and"
40,"Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here.  The grounds and rooms are lovely and well kept, with charming tile decorations.  The beds were very comfortable.  The grounds are spacious enough that you can relax alone if you'd like, or meet other travellers if you'd rather.  The location is amazing - it's only a couple of blocks to the ocean and a strip of lovely restaurants, and a short drive away from several other beaches.  The hotel felt very safe and secure, and we really enjoyed the pool and the hammocks.  What stops this from being a perfect review was the awkwardness of the Christmas eve meal (I'm told a similar gathering happens every week).  It's a nice idea to host a meal so gusts can meet each other, and the idea of free drinks and a free meal is nice as well.  What was"
10,"Our first meal we ordered a Cesar salad and soup, the lettuce was brown and the soup had no flavour.  The next time we went to the restaurant there were 10 of us, Half got their meals, the other half waited for 7 to 10 minutes after the first meal was delivered.  We went to the Thai restaurant today, 3 of us ordered wings but they only had enough wings for one order.  They had a BBQ buffet the other day for 500 pesos and they ran out of ribs....really?   They segregate the owners and the renters by towel colour at the pools so everyone knows who is an owner and who is a renter, not sure what the purpose of this is ....??   The management sit around in the restaurant in the late afternoon to be served their afternoon lunch and drinks which takes away from the service of other"
30,"Nice place, definitely purchase AC & prepare to possibly have some geckos in your room. Feels like a home away from home, paradise! Minutes from beach and beautiful areas to lounge both on decks (some with sea view) and by the pool! Great place!"
50,"We had a very nice stay at casamar! The staff gave us a warm welcome and the owner treat us like we were family. It is a place where you can socialize with other guests but you can also easily relax on your own. The rooms and facilties were also very good! Our advise: start your day with a cup of coffee (which is ready on sunrise every day), and drink it at your terrace with view.   Greeting from the 'cousins' from the Netherlands!"
50,"We really enjoyed our stay at hotel Casamar. The accommodation was fully equipped! Even nicer and finer than presented online. The focus is (partly) on health. Healthy smoothies, salads and other delicious food. The swimming pool is chlorine-free. In addition, every day free yoga and aqua-robics.The employees are extremely friendly. They also spoke English very well. There were plenty of opportunities for excursions from the hotel. One word: Awesome!"
50,"My wife and 2 kids (5 and 3.5) and I stayed at CasaMar for 6 weeks (end of July, all of August and the beginning of September) at the beginning of a 1 year family sabbatical.  We loved our time here.  We came to surf but instead ended up swimming in the pool almost every day, sometimes 2-3 times per day and our kids left so much more confident and competent in the water.  The location is walkable to break at La Punta (the point) to the south (10 min)  as well as Zicatela Beach Break to the north or walk 20 seconds to the main road and grab a cab for 30-40 pesos ($2-3 US).  The staff were all so kind and after being there so long they became like family.  Willits the owner has put heart and soul into this enclave of 15 accommodations and the attention to detail really shows.  Do"
50,"I've been to Puerto Escondido the last three years, but this is the first year I stayed at Casamar Hotel.  After my stay, I am wishing it was my third time!  The owner, Wilets, and his staff bend over backwards to make your stay the most comfortable and secure ever.  He even hosted a meet and greet party for the hotel guests and some local residents that included a full home cooked dinner and drinks.  The grounds are beautifully landscaped, pool well maintained and air conditioning in every room!"
50,"I love the gardens, the food in the cafe is delicious, the friendly service, It feels like Family,  no chlorine in the pool, no smoking, no bar, no TVs in the Suites, lots of green grass, Hammocks between the palm trees,  3 minutes from the beach.  Many murals on the walls of the building.  Fenced in compound for great security.  Community library and TV room.  Yoga every day as well as aqua fit in the pool.  I love the cats. and now and then a dog.  I love this place and just keep coming back. "
50,It is the best place to stay in Puerto Escondido for sure! Nice pool without chlorine and a very beutiful garden and a very friendly owner. Besides there is yoga and aqua aerobics  for free. You can spend very relaxing days there. 
50,"Treated ourselves to the 'romantic suite' and were blown away at the top floor suite we found ourselves in, with a prime view of the ocean. Close to the lively La Punta area, south of Puerto, the hotel provides the perfect balance of seclusion with proximity to great local restaurants and bars. Not to mention the fabulous garden and on site amenities... You almost don't need to leave the grounds. Our stay at Casamar was a real treat and we highly recommend it 👍"
50,"I recently stayed at Casamar Suites Hotel and I am so very glad I did. I  found it to be very comfortable and quiet. I loved the chlorine free, copper ionized pool. I also loved the staff who were extremely welcoming, helpful and kind.. 5 star service!!  Casamar is situated just a short walk to the thriving little surf town of La Punta on Playa Zicatela. I would stay here again without hesitation."
50,We could not ask for a better place for our vacation.  The views are spectacular!  The food in their restaurant id delicious and the the staff was so warm and inviting.  Sunsets and margaritas and hammocks... Perfect!
50,"Everything from the room, atmosphere, and food were incredible! I will never forget waking up every morning and looking out my bedroom window and seeing one of the most amazing sites ever. I couldn't imagine having anything close to a bad expeirence at Villas Carrizalillo."
50,"If you are looking for an impressive, affordable, relaxing getaway, look no further! This place is the best Mexico has to offer - comfortable accommodations, fabulous beachfront and pool, gorgeous atmosphere, and stellar food! I really appreciated the responsive, helpful, and very professional staff who seemed to truly enjoy what they do and knew everything there was to know about the area. Our clean and cozy villa didn't have a beach view, but it had a lovely stone shower, an excellent hammock, plenty of outdoor patio space, and a huge, beautifully tiled kitchen! I only hope I am lucky enough to stay here again someday."
50,The entire experience at Villas Carrizalillo was incredible. The property is stunning and the staff was incredibly accommodating. There is a beautiful beach a short walk from the villas and you can spend the whole day there easily. There is a wonderful restaurant on the property.  I would highly recommend staying at the Villas anytime you are visiting Puerto Escondido.
50,"My wife and I got married at the Villas and everything was perfect.  They made all of us feel so special.  The hospitality was so warm and thought full, all of our guests felt so welcomed and well cared for.  The food and drinks were off the charts and we are all addicted to the Jugo Verde.  The spectacular view made for an ideal setting."
40,it is the best location to see the beach and enjoy the breakfast. food is like the other restaurant . but the service is better. and you can really feel relaxing. the only bad thing is  that we had to walk in the dust with a 4 years old kid to reach there.
50,"We only went for the sunset and dinner at the restaurant of the hotel, is totally worth it to arrive early for the show, the view from the terrace is amazing you can have a mezcal margarita and enjoy the sunset, before having a great dinner. The staff is really nice and service is good. "
40,"After walking and motoring around Puerto for three days I can say this was the best location IF you are not a hard core surfer AND can handle walking up steps.   Access to restaurants (Cafecito a must for breakfast) and a convenience store within a 7 min walk. You can access Playa Carrizalillo right from the property. The beach has what a family needs (assuming your not a hard core surfer) to chill, eat, drink and take surf lessons.   Taxis come and pick you up at hotel and can take you to/from the playa Zicatela boardwalk where there are about 25 beachfront restaurants and assorted shops. It's a 7min ride and costs ~30 pesos mx.   Couple of notes ref the hotel: 1) There is NO better view in Puerto to dine. Food was simple, clean, very flavorful and the drinks were also very"
50,"I recently visited Puerto Escondido with my boyfriend for a last minute getaway from our hectic lives in the US. When originally planning this week getaway, we knew we wanted a few days in Mexico City and a few days at the beach. By the time we actually booked a flight within Mexico to the coast, most of your typical US to Mexico destinations were too expensive for the time we would have been there. By the grace of God, we stumbled upon inexpensive tickets with Viva Aerobus and decided to check out Puerto, not really knowing what we were getting ourselves into.   We were also happy to find a very last minute room at Villas Carrizalillo, in their Terraza villa, and we could not have had a better stay with them. The staff is friendly, knowledgable, and very accommodating. The"
50,"There is NOTHING that compares with sitting in the restaurant Espadin, enjoying the highest quality Mexican cuisine while sipping their fantastic house Mezcal (don't forget to ask your waiter!) and taking in the most spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean and the stunning Playa Carrizalillo. We spent two magical weeks in the Villa Londres, taking it all in and loving it! From the stunning sunsets to the refreshing pool to the accommodating staff(shout out to Freddy and Magdalena!!) and the mind-blowing beach, the Villas literally has it all!! If you are privileged enough to spend some time there, don't forget to ask the front desk to arrange for an ""in-villa"" massage therapist visit....heavenly! Can't wait to return..."
50,"What a lovely place ! Very clean and high service.. Employees are always smiling and ready to help you if you have questions. There are plenty different nice spots in the hotel that will make your stay unforgettable (pool, fitness, restaurant bar, games etc..) We will definitely come back :)  BIG THANKS for this amazing experience !"
50,This place is awesome !!! The staff is really friendly and helpful and it has a real family feel about it all.  Josemar and Javier at the front desk are great guys and always had time for a chat and see how the day was going.   10/10 I would stay there again.   The pool is pretty kick ass too. Great way to cool off in the hot sun.
50,"Very nice friendly place , lots of activities with bike and surf board rental included in the stay .  Breakfast was nice with options for a larger meal for only $MX 100.   I would strongly recommend staying here when visiting"
50,"The hotel itself was an oasis of peace. I loved the two rooftops (one with a bar which was not open when I went and the other one a yoga/fitness studio) and watch the ocean and the trees. It was very quiet and meditative.  There was always music around the hotel, which was never too much, jsut the right amount to want to hang out at the pool.  The room itself was very nice, clean, had everything I needed really.  The location as well was great, hidden from the main road, in a quiet street, but easily walkable to the beach and the main buzzying street. Shout out to Noemi and the staff who made my stay very enjoyable!"
50,We had a very pleasant stay at this picturesque boutique hotel. Javier and Josmar did an excellent job at ensuring that we had everything that we needed to enjoy our week to the fullest. The tours that they arrange for us were top-notch and competitively priced. My wife and I will definitely be coming back!
40,"The staff is super nice and the amenities are great. There is a fitness studio and a well equipped yoga studio with classes and the opportunity to use it on your own. The beekeeper is super nice and creates excellent drinks for you which are not expensive at all.  The hotel staff also arranges excursions and surf lessons for you. They are very helpful.  The included breakfast is not good. Just fruits, bread, filter coffee and a narrow selection of teas. If you want anything extra, you have to pay. That can be definitely improved! Anyway, you find several nice breakfast spots nearby. The hotel location is very good.  Last, but not least, the rooms in the older part of the hotel are quite bad. One mattress was super old. There are no windows in the sleeping rooms, no reading"
30," It was clean, beautiful, nice pool, really good location, nice with all equipment for activities (like bikes). The things I didn't like was the service. The staff was friendly when everything was calm but when you had some questions or needed something else (like extra towels to the pool) they almost didn't help or talked unpleasant. Specially during breakfast itd was frustrating. It says that breakfast is included BUT you need to make it yourself..! And the fruit bowl is little. I tried to ask for other fruits than what i saw her cut (I say they had plenty other) but she answered that it was what I could get..  Also, we where three persons in one room (that is supposed to be for even 4 persons) and it felt really little! Still I was in general content, but next time I'll"
50,"Casa De Olas was a wonderful place to stay. The staff were kind and helpful. The rooms and facilities were clean and well kept. The fishing trip was an amazing and unique experience and the surfing was unreal Will definitely be returning. Thank you, Casa De Olas."
50,"Excellent hotel. I recommend it 100%. It is super nice, clean and with excellent service. It is located very near from many delicious restaurants and fun bars, as well as from de beach. All workers have a very good vibe, they are very attentive and friendly. Perfect place to spend a perfect vacation with friends."
50,We loved this place! and  we will definitely return again! The balcony was perfect for out door yoga. The rooms were spacious and clean. The pool area was totally our vibe! The owner was very friendly and helpful! Glad to come back again for our next trip to puerto!
50,"When you want to book a hotel/hostel you usually look at 4 different things. 1. Is it well located? YES, 30 seconds to the beach with an awesome point break, La Punta 2. Is is clean? Yes, extremely clean 3. Is the staff welcoming? Yes. Once you meet David and his wife Swatje, you will feel right at home. 4. Is it expensive? The best deal around. Surf instructor, with board and a place to stay for under $100 a night? You can't beat it.   Great for solo traveller, couples or possibly a small family.  Thanks for a great time.  D  If your flying into Escondido, your a 10 minute taxi drive to their Beach House($5), maybe less"
50,"I stayed here for a week in eraly october and it was really perfect! David and Swantje are fantastic - chilled out, really friendly and the acocmodation is really great. I stayed in two different rooms and both were perfect - really clean, good attention to detail and the garden is lovely! The surf spot (if working) is just in front of the house. I also loved that it was not in puerto zicatela itself. It was just 30mns walk into the main town (or 5mns in a taxi), but there are also a few good restaurants right by the surfhouse so you didn't have to go into 'town' unless you wanted. I would go back tomorrow if I could!!!"
50,"This place is great. David and Swantje make you feel really welcome from the start. Their house is 50m from the beach, the rooms are big and clean, and you meet great people.  David and the other surf instructors are fun and get in the water with you to make sure you get as a many waves as possible.  The best thing is it's a bit like staying with a family so its a different vibe to hostels.  Would definitely go back."
50,"We had an amazing stay at the Puerto Surf House. The location beside the beach is great, the place itself is beautiful and clearly maintained with care and love. The waves at La Punta were incredible to watch but not appropriate for beginner surfers so we headed to Carrizalillo where the waves were great for learning, and under excellent coaching provided by David, we were both by how many waves we rode on the first day! The area around the surf house is perfect for relaxing at the end of the day, with nice bars and excellent local food options. I certainly hope that I will be returning to Puerto Escondido Surf House in the not-so-distant future!"
50,"I have stayed in many places in Puerto Escondido and this is by far the best one. The rooms are really clean and comfortable, close to the beach and not expensive at all. Plus the surf lessons are awesome, they take you to the surf spots in a cool VW Combi, they even take you pictures while surfing! And the staff is great too, I will definitely come back here."
50,"I stayed in Puerto Surf House a little under a week and really enjoyed my time there. The place is incredibly relaxing a little away from the main tourism centre. La Punta break is a few minutes walk which is much more suitable for beginners and intermediates than the main Zicatela beach. David has a good selection of boards that you can rent and even though I did not take lessons, I often went together with the guys to surf spots which was loads of fun. The room was great, clean and well designed and there is a lovely garden where you can hang out and enjoy the hammocks and an evening drink. Highly recommended."
50,"I really enjoyed my week at the Puerto Escondido Surf house. David was a great host and always checked to make sure we were comfortable and were getting the most out of our daily surf lessons. Room was clean and comfortable. We checked out other beaches during our stay but prefered to just hang around La Punta for the last few nights of our trip because we liked it that much.The beach was clean and not too crowded. The local restaurants and cafes are of a high standard but aren't cheesy and commercial. They are high quality organic-type places - which I like. Getting to the other beaches from La Punta is easy and economical by taxi. If I have any friends heading to Puerto Esconidido, I'll definitely recommend Puerto Escondido Surf House without hesitation."
50,"I initially stayed 5 days my first visit to Puerto Escondido as a solo traveler.  I came not too long after my first surf trip and wanted additional instruction as a beginner.  This place totally exceed all of my expectations.  Not only was the value great and the rooms nice, but David the owner was so welcoming and hospitable.  The Surf House is located right next to the beach where the break for beginning/intermediate surfers is located, so you don't have to walk far.  The instructors were very helpful and competent, and I improved over the course of the week.  David's technique for getting up on the board was definitely easier that the one that was taught to me before, and I instantly was catching more waves.  You can tell that he has a passion for instruction because his"
50,"It over exceeded my expectations of what my stay on Puerto Escondido would be.  The place and the people managing it gave a unique touch to this amazing place.  From the rooms that connect you with the mother nature without loosing the 5 star comfort, to the dedicated surf classes that they provide during the whole day plus the excellent hosts that in short time will became good friends, disconnects you from the world in the most pleasant and relaxed way, at the same time having an adventure and discovering the paradise of one of the most beautiful Mexican Coasts."
50,"The Surf House is fantastic.  My room was great, the kitchen was super convenient, and sitting in the hammock in the backyard listening to the surf was perfect.  David and the rest of the instructors were super helpful, not only out in the water, but also with answering questions about other things to do and local knowledge.  I hope to make it back again and I'd certainly recommend David's place to any of my friends."
50,"After 6 years of being there my husband and I decided to go back to this hotel, it is located in a very quiet neighborhood and a 5 minutes walk to Carrizalillo beach which is also the best beach in Puerto Escondido in our opinion, also 5 minutes from different choices of restaurants, no need to take a taxi unless you want to go to ""El Adoquin"", also is very easy to take a taxi you just need to walk one block and wait a few minutes. The hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly, during the afternoon or night you can rest in the small pool or in the mini bar listening music, I will definitively stay again in Quinta Lili if I decide to spend a few days in Puerto Escondido in the future."
50,"This place is simply fantastic, we felt so welcome and it simply felt like a home away from home. We arrived early from our flight from Oaxaca City to a warm welcome and fantastic breakfast. A quick rundown of the best sights and restaurants helped us plan what we wanted to do, the best part being they can organise actives for you. Playa Carazalilla is less than 10 minutes walk and a great place for a dip/surf lessons. The rooms are great, the pool is great, location IMO is great (close to some great food and away from the noise of the main town). But the best part are the hosts, it really felt like we were visiting friends and they were the most humble people we've met in Mexico. I cannot praise their hospitality enough, seriously they were so lovely. We came here to relax for"
40,"Quinta Lili was a wonderful place to spend our vacation.  In a calm and quiet location, located by the best beach for swimming and learning how to surf. Also near the most delicious cocos frios in town! Lovely and fascinating conversations with hotel owner, Adelina, every morning! Hotel staff was very helpful in finding the best eats, shops, beaches, etc!"
50,"We got a surprisingly warm welcome when we arrived very early by plane in Puerto. Hotel staff received us as if we had been friends for years. While we installed ourselves in the room an excellent breakfast was prepared. In a relaxing atmosphere we got all info you could dream of. Super! The hotel is located in a very quiet corner but in walking distance of shops and restaurant and only 10 min from the amzing beach of Carrizallio where you can safely relax and under a palapa. A good book, a swim every half hour and a few ice cold drinks is all you need 😉"
50,"We had the Sunrise Room. It was beautiful, clean and spacious room with a fan. The staff was super-friendly and helpful in every matter. Breakfast very delicious and changed every day.  The hotel is close to restaurants and the beach.  I would always come back..."
50,"My boyfriend and I were staying at Quinta lili in April.  We had picked Puerto Escondido kind of at random, but once we got there we realized it was the best choice ever!  Our stay was incredible! The architecture of the hotel is so special, and gives the whole place a dream-like feel. There is everything you need at Quinta Lili, you really feel at home.  Adelina was super sweet, she helped us plan our days, and made sure we did everything we wanted. She knows everything about the city, and shared amazing advice.  Magdalena who also helps take care of the place, is an amazing cook, and the sweetest person ever. She always had a smile to greet us!  The breakfasts were exceptional, it made us love mexican food. The rooms were great, we had everything we needed and more!  We can't"
40,"I liked the hotel, however, the pool water was cold for my taste and I couldn´t enjoy it The owner is super nice! she is there every morning to welcome all guests. The cook prepares breakfast infront of your eyes, while you wait in the kitchen bar for it.   The quinta is located rather in a secluded place, it is not a touristic area at all, it is more like in a residencial area, BUT it is walking distance form my favorite beach in Puerto Escondido: Carrizalillo!  All and all, I enjoyed my stay! T"
50,"This place was ACE! Please note that if you normally stay in the Hyatt or a 4 Seasons or Hilton then this is probably not for you. However if you like customised service, great location in an enviroment that is a home away from home then this is your place. We stayed for a week and felt like we were royalty. Nothing was to big or small.  It was my partners birthday whilst we were there and they went seriously OTT for me, cake, flowers, bottles of fizz!. They even dropped rose pettals on the floor   So the food is amazing, breakfast is very typical mexican food, not your boring buffet.  The room we stayed in was the master suite on the top floor, it was very spacious and super romantic.  Cant say enough great things about this place! we will definately go back"
50,"My visit to Quinta Lili was awesome,friendly  owners and great staff. We enjoyed the cook/housekeeper's great Mexican breakfasts.They make you feel like family.The owner,Adelina stopped by every day to see if we needed anything. We received a discount on theamazing Dolphin Tour because we were at Quinta.  The locked and alarmed hotel made us feel comfortable and safe.We loved being in the  Rincanada area, if we wanted to stay in the neighbourhood,everything was a short walk away. I was there for 2 weeks and we were able to easily access  great  restaurants,beaches and shopping. Everything was a 2 dollar cab ride no less than 10 minutes away. Great vacation and I would definitely go back and encourage others to go."
50,"This is by far the best beach vacation that we have had in years thanks to the Quinta Lili team!!  -  The location is super convenient for people wanting to be close to Playa Carrizalillo (great waves!) and the hotel itself is in great shape.  From the moment we arrived, Adelina and her team went above and beyond to make us feel like home. The Mexican breakfasts are out of this world and were definitely one of the highlights of our trip. Magdalena (The Chef) was super attentive and ready to answer our questions about Oaxaca and specially about Oaxacan cuisine.    Last but note least: The fridge is stocked Biercito. This is beer is brewed locally by the Quinta Lilil team and it is the perfect refreshment after a long day at the beach. I wish I could bring some Biercito home. We"
50,"We spent a few days at Hotel Paraiso around New Year 2013, and enjoyed it. The rooms were comfortable and very clean, the pool and common areas very nice, the location convenient, and the staff very friendly. We'd stay there again."
40,Great place! Located close to the beach and also colse to the town center. The stuff are very helpful and wants you to really enjoy your stay here!  Pool could have been cleaner. We thought it was a problem but it did not seam to bother the other guest.  Only a two charging places in the room. Wifi did not reach our room. (29)  Over all a very nice place!
40,"i stayed at this hotel, and was clean and just right for the rate i paid. it's close to everything but at the same time you feel far apart from everything. the staff is very friendly and they always try to help people and they give you good directions if you don't know the city"
40,"This hotel gets 4 stars because of the manager, Tony, who welcomed me with a cold beer and went as far as to get me a lime from the back garden to go with it...and not just on my first day but every day I was there. He let me pay the day after I arrived so that I could pay in cash...ran into him at the grocery store and he gave me a ride back...whatever I asked he was able to provide. Some friends of mine recommended this hotel mostly because of Tony and now I understand why! He makes the hotel! I will be back but only if Tony is still the manager..."
50,"This was our fourth stay in this charming hacienda style hotel. There have been some improvements made since last year which made it even better. The air conditioning was upgraded and an extra wifi router was installed allowing better connections to the internet. The property is still maintained quite well. The landscaping is immaculate and the pool is cleaned daily. The top floor rooms offer the best view of the ocean. Room 5 is our favorite because it has its own small dipping pool and a full kitchen. Note it is also the most expensive room in this hotel. There is a shared kitchen which everyone can use and is really handy if you have food items to be refrigerated or frozen.  The hotel's location is central to everything. You can easily walk to the beaches, shops, Super Che"
50,"I stayed at Hotel Paraiso Escondido several times in the early to mid-90's and loved it.  When my wife and I returned in February, 2014, I was concerned it may have changed in all those years.  We were not disappointed, in fact, we loved it!  The hotel is charming and decorated with colorful Mexican tiles and pre-Hispanic images and statues.  The rooms are basic but clean and well-maintained.  The pool is delightful.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  It is a bargain compared to many more expensive hotels that offer less charm.  The hotel sits up a few blocks above the beach and the upper rooms offer panoramic views of the ocean (the view from the pool level is obscured by trees that have grown up over the years).  The A/C worked well and was necessary in the hot weather -- a"
50,"This place is incredible! All of the staff is ridiculously pleasant and helpful. The owner (manager?) is super friendly, and really goes above and beyond to make your stay pleasant - from recommending restaurants and places to go to getting beer out of his personal fridge for us when the bar was closed! He also speaks 5 languages (!). Their restaurant is fantastic as well - the huevos rancheros are the best I've ever had.   Clean, sunny room with closet and (small) TV, clean outdoor area, beautiful pool area with everything you could ever need steps away.   Rooms fully cleaned every day, private balconies, WiFi, fast-acting, powerful A/C (you'll need it!) etc."
40,"We really enjoyed our stay here even though it was off season and we think for a couple if days we were the only ones there.  It was close to the bus station which was handy for us, and just a very short walk to the beach.  The staff couldn't be more friendly or helpful even though we were suffering from the start of the hurricane which hit the south coast just after we left. Lovely pool, air conditioned room and we had access to the kitchen up on the third floor which was helpful. Taxis to and from town at night were very cheap and make sure you check out the bars on the beach, we had some amazing food with great views, well worth the long bus trip."
50,"Very nice hotel and very fairly priced for the quality. This hotel was much nicer than the rest we looked at and had very nice architecture. The Wi-Fi was a little weak in suite two for phones, but the computers and ipads picked up the signal just fine."
30,"We made our reservation through the booking website. Where it was also highly ranked. We arrived to the hotel which is in the city, close to the Main Street that goes down to the main beach in puerto Escondido. The service was amicable and information was given to us regarding tourist visits and so on. The general setting of the hotel is outdated and some upkeep would not do any harm. It is quite rustic and the rooms could do with a few re-touches. Air-con was a little noisy and toilet was broken, but fixed a ad later after letting the receptionist know. There was no restaurant service, we don't know wether this was due to season or just lack of staff. The rooms were cleaned but late afternoon. We left early morning came back after lunch and the rooms hadn't been cleaned, it"
10,"Ok, we arrived at Villasol exhausted after a 10 hour long journey through the mountains(which was not the hotels fault). The rececptionist was very young and unexperienced. He seemed nervous and couldnt find our reservation. It took him for ages and he allocated us in a horrible and dirty room with view to a road being renovated. After a complaint and enquiry we found out that for 12 dollars extra a night we could get a room with a balcony. Travelling 2 couples with children and tired after a long journey it was quite annoying that he didnt suggest this in the beginning or gave us a decent room.  Our friends had booked a master suite and this was a complete joke. The receptionist gave them a ""suite"" in the basement level, smelling humid and dark. So we also had to complain about"
10,"First the positives: this hotel offers an awesome beach club, just 2 min drive away (or there is a free shuttle). Use of beach club is free, reasonably priced food at the club, and great place for families: beach, pool, playhouse. Otherwise, I CANNOT recommend this hotel. We are family with 3 young children. Cancelled our second night here and went elsewhere. Why? First: our room was small, poorly maintained, and dirty, nothing like what was represented online. The manager was completely ambivolent. We had to pay an additional $200 pesos to upgrade to a room that with ‘acceptable’ standard of cleanliness. Even so it had a strong pet odor and the AC didn’t work (on the 3rd floor in the tropics!). Second: The Staff can only be described as indifferent. I pity any guest who doesn’t"
50,"Walking into the lobby and the reception I was met by Alejandra with a big smile and she spoke English too.  The hotel is large, surrounding a huge pool and garden area.  My room on the 4th floor had a private balcony overlooking the pool.  The hotel is just a tiny bit tired but the price was well worth all the amenities.  For my room rate it included a decent breakfast each morning.  My room had great A/C which was quiet.  The hotel was very quiet until the weekend when local tourist came in by the busload.  The beach club, just one km down the hill was perfect.  It has a great pool, a sort of swimup bar, attentive waiters and good food (except for the deluxe burger... the meat was pre-cooked and I couldn't eat it) especially the french fries.  Villa Sol is in the Bacocho, a"
10,"This is a horrible hotel, with such bad customer service, old rooms and outdated. No WIFI on our room whatsoever, we decided to call management to get another room with WIFI and they told us that the hotel was full, yes full in LOW SEASON! and the place looked like a ghost town.  The beach club near the hotel is almost 800 meters away and with transportation not fluent because of the low season, we ended up walking, when we got there, more disappointed was heading our way, the beach says that is not for swimming and that there they don't have a life guard so its pretty much every man and women for them self! We headed back to the hotel know almost a 1.5 K walk, and headed to the hotel to eat, since the hotel is not near any restaurants or the tourist area for that mater, so we"
10,"Hi there! I'm looking through these ""Excellent"" reviews and it looks like we were in different hotels. 1. It's expensive. 2. Rooms are old and broken. 3. Managers tried to interfere with our rest: you can sit here — not there (when we tried to sit with the chaise-longue on the beach), drink this — not that, etc. 4. It was absolutely unclear what was included in the breakfast and for what I need additionally pay. 5. Wi-fi is awful. ...the list can be quite long but we were only 3 days there.  Hope this will help you to make right choice. Cheers"
50,"We spent a lot of days at Villasol, relaxing in the pool area, having dinner and massages. The service is really good, and you can just relax and have a good time. Something really cool is there cinema night at the beach. Its starts right after sunset one day a week, and it`s really an amazing experience. We´re definitely going back to Villasol next time again."
50,"Last year 2013 in february, I visited this hotel because of the cinema on the beach that they are organizing on every wednesday evening. What do you want more on holidays? With friends? Your partner? Or your whole family? Nothing I thought! During this evening I saw the beach club that they have (swimmingpools, nice bar, perfect restaurant and on the beach) and I was sold: next year this would be the first hotel to visit in Puerto   So, one year later, this february 2014, I went to visit this hotel again with family and stayed there for some nights. Amazing nice and friendly stuff, all of them, the beach club looks as beautiful as last year (or maybe even more beautiful), good price for such a beautiful hotel and furthermore the hotel and the rooms are super clean too. Moreover,"
50,"I enjoyed my stay at VillaSol during my 14 day visit.  Although it might not be considered a ""four star or better"", it had everything I needed.  The staff were friendly and helpful, my room was cleaned to perfection each day.  The staff were very attentive to anything I brought forward (I had a near miss with a coconut falling off a tree that missed me by about 6 inches).  I reported it and the next day they had a guy removing coconuts from the trees.  The Beach Club is wonderful....a beautiful pool with swim up bar, excellent restaurant with a nice variety of foods on the menu, attentive waiters and staff.  The shuttle to take people to the beach is driven by the very personable Moresto (not sure I spelled that right) and his other driving partner Bento (spelling again?).  The"
50,"We loved our stay in the hotel, everyone was very nice and kind. We went as a family and everyone of us had an excellent time... Great beach club, the service is really excellent! Loved the restaurant Pez Gallo, very good food! Our stay was really good, we will be back soon!"
50,"We had our wedding in VillaSol on January 4th, 2014. It was a magnificent event, and we could not have been happier with how the night turned out. Nohemi and Enrique at VillaSol worked with us on a custom menu, special lighting and ambiance, and great musicians (mariachi and DJ).  While we sourced the decorations and music on our own, VillaSol was very open to this highly customized approach and it allowed us to have the wedding of our dreams.  The menu of traditional Oaxacan tamales, tacos, and chiles rellenos was delicious, and the guests enjoyed it immensely.  We would do it again in a heartbeat!  Thank you, gracias VillaSol!"
50,"My husband and I stayed at the Flor de Maria at the end of January.  What can I say?  We had the time of our lives - beautiful, quaint, clean little hotel close to the beach.  The friendliest of staff - Paul and Joanne welcomed us as if we coming into their home.  Joanne's cooking is wonderful and we will definitely be back.  We found lots to do and spent out time watching the surfers, meeting great people and watching the most beautiful sunsets.  We loved the live music in many of the little bars and restaurants around.  The local people were so friendly and helped us with out spanish.  I think we saved the best of Mexico until the last."
50,"This hotel is the best value we stayed in in Mexico, right on the beach with a lovely pool and bar on the roof which overlook the Pacific.  The rooms and very clean and comfortable.  The staff are very friendly and helpful - on our day of departure they let us leave our bags in reception until the evening and use the pool/sun loungers on the roof all day until our bus.  Also free wi-fi, drinking water and good restaurant."
50,"We have just returned from our trip to Puerto Escondido ,Oaxaca . We stayed at  Hotel Flor de Maria .  The hotel is spotless, the rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The staff was always smiling ;and the owners, Paul and Joanne and very gracious, helpful and knowledgeable.  It's a small hotel on a cobblestone street which ends at the beach ( a 2 minute walk ) and you can swim here unlike Zicatela beach which is just for surfers . The rooftop terrace has a small cooling off pool and a spectacular view of the beach, ocean and sunsets. They make the best drinks in town.                We found that the location is ideal, with no bars or discos close by, so it was very quiet for sleeping. The walk into town was about 10 minutes in one direction and 10 minutes in the other"
50,"This is a great hotel close to the beach with a nice roof terrace and pool. The sun sets from the roof terrace are fantastic. We spent Christmas and New Year in this hotel. The couple running the hotel, Paul and Joanne, are very friendly and helpful and made us feel at home. Their restaurant is best in town - great food! We enjoyed it so much that we extended our stay by an extra week."
50,We have visited the Hotel Flor de Maria many times over the last 20 years. For us it is perfect. Steps from a wonderful beach. Affordable clean room. Roof terrace pool and bar for relaxation and sunset and an excellent restaurant off of the lobby.
50,"It is a pleasant and comfortable place to hang out, the food is delicious and the owners are gracious...."
40,"In February I had the pleasure of staying at Flor de Maria and it was absolutely perfect for me, a single female travelor!  The hotel is located a two minute walk from Playa Marinero, nestled between the expansive but rough Playa Zicatela and the charming fishing boat filled bay of Puerto Escondido. The water is safe and one is less than a ten minute walk by beach or by road to the main town or to the Zicatela area. Joanne and Paul were extremely friendly and helpful hosts and I felt at home rigt away. The hotel is not luxurious but it is homey and clean and has a wonderful roof top with a small, refresing pool, shaded tables and hammocks and a bar that serves delicious, potent drinks. There is no music playing so one can read or snooze in peace. The view is spectacular,"
30,"The owners are very friendly and helpful. The location is okay, close to Marinaro Beach and good swimming. There is no view of the water from any of the rooms as far as I can tell. No real view of anything of interest. The owners must have something against people sitting down in their Hotel, unless it is in the Restaurant or rooftop bar. No chairs or benches anywhere! Large open air wrap around lobby on each floor and not one place to sit down. Even the roof terrace & bar was short of chairs when it was busy. They had a few hammocks up there, but they were almost always occupied by old fossils who looked like thay might actually never awake from their sleep. Rooms were adequate, nothing fancy. There was a lot of lovely wall paintings that had been there for years. Almost all of"
40,"Paul and Joanne were accommodating in every way.  Food in the dining room is very good, the hotel is close to the beach, very clean rooms, nice rooftop deck.  Not fancy, but a nice economical place to stay."
50,"We had a wonderful, relaxing 3-week stay with hosts Joanne and Paul.  Our room was comfortable and cool even in the heat of the day.  We loved the walks along the beach in the early morning, mingling with the local fishermen, reading and relaxing in a hammock on the roof during the heat of the day, Spanish lessons in the afternoon, followed by margaritas on the roof at sunset … then dinner served by Pedro in the excellent hotel restaurant. Thank you Paul and Joanne … we definitely plan to visit you again."
40,"spent two weeks here in Sept. Best location on zicatella beach handy to all the pubs and restaurants. Clean rooms, (you can get self contained with fridge and cooker if you want) and great food in the restaurant so we never ended up cooking once! Hotel is run by a really cool family and the staff are very freindly. Right across the road from Zicatella beach and the famous ""mexican pipeline"" If the waves are no good just relax poolside with a few cold ones and meet some new freinds. I would go back here again anyday!"
40,Beach Hotel Ines is a perfect place to stay in Puerto Escondido. A few miles or a 5 minute taxi from the main town this place is ideal if you have had enough of the bustling streets of Mexican cities and just want to chill out and enjoy the waves. Beach Hotel Ines was very good value for money with very large rooms and I believe that most of them have air con and balconies. The pool was also one of it's best assets as the waves on the beach opposite are meant for surfing and not swimming. You can also indulge in a massage for around 400 pesos an hour. Most of the restaurants along this strip are a stones throw from the hotel and ther are plenty of surf shops to chose from. We went for the one 3 to 4 doors right of the hotel run by two brothers and having never surfed before we
40,Great spot right across the road from one of the best beaches in Puerto Escondido. Friendly service from all we came across while there. The pool and restaurant next to it were lovely to hang out in when it got too hot! Rooms are relatively basic but in line with how much rooms cost there.
40,"Hotel was right across the street from the surfer's beach. Many very good restaurants within easy walking distance. Good swimming beach (we're not surfers), 10 min walk away. We met Ines, the hotel owner, in the restaurant one night - she was very gracious and friendly. Definitely recommend this hotel!"
10,"This hotel was recomended by a good firend. Seems that it is ok in low season. But in high season definitely not good. The priced is changed at arrival, the direction is really unfriendly. The price are high compared to same quality hotels on the beach. For same price prefer Olas Altas. It has prices of boutique but not the quality. It welcomes big groups of young people that are really noisy, drink in the swimming pool; let everything dirty, throw bear in the swimming pool.  Prefer other solutions on zicatelas. Aquario (or somthing like that) has same quality but for more reasonnable prices.  The wifi is free but getting up and down. FYI: a 5 percent fee is required to pay by card and Zicatela has no cash machine."
40,"Hotel Ines is rjight across the street from the beach. You can hear the thunder ot the waves coming in throughout the day and night. Nice chilled out swimming pool area with restaurant, bar, and tanning beds. Friendly service, clean rooms. My room had an air conditioner which rattled a bit, but still a good option to take advantage of."
50,"We had never been to Puerto Escondido before, but had an amazing experience. Hotel Ines is located on Zicatela beach, and it was such a convenient location and amazing view of the ocean. We got a room with a seperate bedroom, shared it with my parents so it was very affordable. We had a balcony right onto the main street on Zicatela, and had a great view of the surfers! The only negative was it was kind of noisy in the mornings and hard to sleep. The pool was awesome, and the restaraunt was great too. All the rooms have fridges, and some even have small stoves. Would definetly recommend to anyone going to PE!"
40,"If you are looking for posh, carpeted, and Ritz- like? Don't go there. If you love beautiful souroundings with flowers, rustic and just quaint. You will love it! The hotel it'self is beautiful! The rooms are basic and nice. The pool is clean and great. There are people from all over the world visiting there. It is in an excellent area of Zicatela beach within walking distance from resteraunts and little shops. Ines and her family are just wonderful people! Not to mention their doggys that live there too... Her resteraunt has delicious items to choose from and the waiter is a nice guy. We couldn't  have picked a better place, thanks to my inlaws that suggested Hotel Ines!  We love Puerto E. !"
10,"Hotel looked great online. After calling and reserving, seemed great. But once we got there, we found out we were lied to about rooms and price. We Were told over the phone which rooms we were going to recieve, so we checked them out and it looked good. When we got there, we were given rooms different from promised and turned out to be a nightmare, unbelievably small, barely enough room to walk around. Also told there was a kitchen, but tunred out there was a small refrigerator, sink, and one-burner stove outside the room on the porch. Management was horrible and critical towards guests. Also a lot of weird characters around. We ended up switching hotels after half the trip."
50,"My partner Jamie & I were guests of Ines', w/ our dog Keiki, for 10 days in Jan-Feb 2009, & we thot it was Heaven.  Our criteria were: a location on Zicatela, w/ an oceanview, our Princess SmartyPanys Perfect PuppyDog Keiki, WiFi, & TV (w/ at least English CNN), & a reasonable/non-hostel rate.  Done!!  If we didn't need a little more room, we've thot, ""we'd live at Hotel Ines forever.""   The coffee was brilliant!!  The WiFi was there, but unpredictable.....sometimes we'd have to go to the bar to connect, but once there, the Internet service---& the bar service--- was perfect, there by the pool.  We enjoyed meeting other people who were staying there, tho no one was pushy about trying to meet us.  The dinners we had there were good, but Ines is so close to other great restaurants"
50,Hotel Escondido is amazing. The location is beautiful and the rooms are mostly private with gorgeous views and private pools. The food is good and the cocktails are great. You can’t beat it for a few days of restful relaxation! My recommendation for people who are used to having their rooms relatively cool for sleeping (we visited in July) is to close the room up and turn the air conditioner on before you go to dinner so that the room has some time to cool down. We loved it here and would happily return.
50,One of my favorite hotels across all Mexico. It is very exclusive with less than 20 bungalows. The room is amazing with your own private little pool. The hotel is situated 30 min away of puerto so basically you have the beach for yourself. Staff is amazing and food also expectacular. I brought my dogs and they have so much fun. The only issue is that it was really hot weather.   
50,"Stayed 5 nights and can only say: go there and enjoy the place for an amazing setting, rustic and cool feel, great staff, and good food.  The accommodation and common areas are really really nice - private and exclusive. The feel is rustic and things are not as in a 5-star luxury hotel in the city but that’s part of the charm.  The location is a bit far from the town but go to stay mainly in the hotel. Didn’t rally to much but one evening in Puerto Escondido, and absolutely loved it.  The hotel has a good bar and the food is good. The evening meal can be a bit hit and miss but overall good.  Get hut #1 if you can because it is really private and gorgeous.  Loved it."
50,"I travel solo often and regularly seek to escape everything and reset for a few days (or weeks). This place was perfect in every respect: food, service, surroundings, design. The privacy and quiet combined with such beautiful, unspoiled natural surroundings made it easy to simply be and enjoy. All of the staff are friendly and go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. A special shout out to Fanuel at the front desk/reservations...he helped me book my flight to Oaxaca when I had issues with the airline web-site. Casa Wabi, just down the beach, is amazing and I highly recommend the tour if you are a fan of art and/or architecture--the building was designed by famous Japanese architect Tadao Ando and the concept behind the place adds to the uniqueness and"
50,"Sometimes you pay for the surroundings...and it is worth it  Hotel Escondido is a 16 suite hotel where each cabin is a hidden, screened, palapa style room with a private pool and patio.  While the rooms, central pool, service and meals are excellent, the mountains, natural vegetation and miles of pristine beach are the real attraction.  We went to relax after Dia de Muerto in Oaxaca (20 minute flight on Aero Tuscan or 7 hours driving through the mountains) before making an encore visit for my bride Faith in Puerto Escondido proper.  Directly in back of the hotel is patio/boardwalk with an olympic length lap pool (think swim laps or run/walk on beach as there isn't a gym) that serves as a central point with attentive service.  There are enough spaces for everybody in the hotel"
50,"Hotel Escondido is not the easiest place to get to, but that's part of what makes it so special.  Located 45 minutes from Puerto Escondido on a pristine stretch of beach, the hotel is made up of 16 concrete villas with palapa roofs, private patios and plunge pools.  They all have a view of the ocean which is accessed by little paths through patches of greener and cactus.  The rooms are furnished tastefully in a minimalist style with very comfortable beds.  The hotel also has a spectacular pool and deck right on the beach, a lovely restaurant that serves excellent food, and a nice lounge area for reading or working.  The hotel staff are very friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  Hotel Escondido is right next to Casa Wabi which is a must visit if you are in the area."
50,"Just a quick note of thanks to everyone on your staff. Our early morning departure today didn't give us the opportunity to thank everyone as personally as we had wished. I'm sure you are aware of how blessed you are to have such a dedicated and professional crew. Even though the weather didn't cooperate during our short 5 day stay, our welcome sunset on the 25th and the beautifull display of brilliant color last night made our stay all the more memorable. The flight with Sr. Vega to Oaxaca was great. We really got to appreciate the Oaxacan countryside low and slow. You live in a wonderful region and we hope we can return soon to explore it more. Please, pass along our best"
50,"I was here twice in one year with my girlfriend and it was always the best part of our trip! 16 individual pool bungalows all with the great same view make this stay so incredibly relaxed, it hurts when you eventually have to leave. The staff is super nice, gets to know you quickly and knows what you like! Frozen Margaritas in my case! Cant wait to come back!"
50,"This is a very unique place. The Pacific is too strong here, so no immersion. On the other hand, a fantastic sight and sound. The hotel is beautiful and comfortable, the food is excelent. Great for two or three nights. Don't miss visiting the neighboring Casa Wabi."
50,"We just returned from an amazing 3-night stay at this magical hotel.  From the moment that we were greeted at the front desk and heard the surf crashing a short distance away we knew we had found a special spot.    The hotel looks exactly as the pictures depict it.  In addition to the amazing common area pool which is literally on the sand, each casa has its own private pool which is quite deep and is warm (many where we have stayed are cold).  The rooms are well-appointed and come with all the expected amenities.  There are extra large towels for use by the pool or to dry off after a dip in the ocean.  Each casa also has a short sandy path which connects you straight to the large, wide and empty beach.  You literally fall asleep to the sound of the waves.  In all my travels I"
50,We originally only booked for 2 nights at Hotelito Swiss Oasis but ended up staying for 6 nights.   Manuela was a wonderful host who assisted us with anything we asked of her. Both Manuela and Rene understand travellers needs as they have traveled the world themselves.   The rooms are cool and bug free. The hotel is set back from the beach front making them quiet. There is a laundromat next door and Hotelio Swiss has a lovely pool should you want to cool off without the sand and heat of the beach.   The price of the rooms was very reasonable for the popularity of the area. We would return here without hesitation.
50,Really the hosts have gone out of their way to make a stay easy and enjoyable. There is a fridge full of beer and water. You take what you want and pay later. Free coffee. Small share kitchen and good refrigerator. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Good security and central location. Bars and cafes all around.  Good surf break across the road. Main problem for me was poor lighting. Impossible to read at night lock on rear patio screen door no existent. No air con but priced accordingly. Nice clean pool. 
50,"This place is perfectly situated and run so cleverly. We had room 3 and checked in during the evening. Rooms are spotless, quiet. Simple.  There is a shared kitchen to use, swimming pool and loungers. The hotel invokes an honesty board which I love! Get a beer, water or cola, just simply mark your room.  Help is given with whatever you want, even when checking out.  Loved it!"
50,"We loved our stay at Swiss Oasis and would highly recommend it to others.  A few reasons why... * Welcoming, helpful, and very friendly owners and staff. * Room and grounds are spotless. * Spacious room and a large comfy bed. * Pool, lounge chairs, hammocks. * Located within a two minute walk to the beach and only a few minutes from some great restaraunts. * Extra touches such as kitchen use; honor system for chilled beer/sodas/water; book exchange; and a selection of things to borrow for the beach such as snorkel and mask, straw hats, beach towels, etc.  We stayed here on our anniversary, which was also in the final week of nearly a year of travel... What a perfect place to celebrate both of these milestones!"
50,Couldn't be nicer ........Immaculate .......Steps from the beach..Great pool ..Nice owners ..........Great places to eat nearby.....I will definitely stay here again ....So many places down here miss the mark ..this one doesn't ..A little oasis
50,"After visiting Puerto many times over the years my son and I have our fondest memories of Puerto at this hotellito with Manuela and Rene, chill out immediately at this tucked away from noise but still right on beach beautiful hotelito and if there is anything you need to know M &R will know or point you in right direction. Couldn't be more hospitable. Looking forward to our next visit."
50,Lovely clean chilled out place.. Nice rooms.. Beer in the communal fridge.. Good coffee pot in the communal kitchen. Nice pool and hammocks. Good location some fantastic restaurants very close.. Just lovely to take an evening walk on the beach with the huge waves crashing..
50,"My partner and I stayed for 10 days, can't recommend hotelito Swiss oasis high enough. Great location, super clean, facilities were fantastic and the hosts were so friendly, informative, trusting and helpful. Can't wait to go back and stay!! "
50,"The Hotelito felt like home. The location is perfect, tucked away in a quiet spot just behind the main road across from Playa Zicatela. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and comfortable. The pool is amazing, always a great place to relax – surrounded by the beautiful landscape of trees, plants and flowers of the Hotelito. The beach is less than a minute away. Shops, bars, restaurants and other facilities are on your doorstep. The hosts were very kind and helpful, and provided lovely recommendations on dining in Puerto Escondido. There cannot possibly be anything more charming, comfortable, beautiful and conveniently located. If you want to watch the sublime waves, take a walk by the beach, swim, surf, go for a nice Mexican bite, have a juice or an Agua de Frutas, explore the"
50,"Rooms, grounds, pool, location. Top Notch. Everything a traveler looks for in a location. Not to mention amazing travel-minded owners. One thing I have to mention. The linens smell wonderful. A random thing to note. However, Manuela, it is somethings to be so proud of. Cheers :)"
50,"Had a very pleasant stay at this resort with my wife. Very nice accommodations, very good food and drinks, and staff was extremely nice and always willing to make our stay better. The pools were very nice and the grounds beautiful. I would highly recommended this resort to anyone who wants to get away and enjoy the great ocean views and white sands of this area."
50,"Clean, safe , quiet hotel, Food is average just average, but fresh, We ate breakfast fresh omelette station, lots of fresh fruit and yogurt. Snack on beach. Ate out for dinner every night. Terrible coffee, terrible wine, Servers in Restaurant definitely wait on Mexicans first even if You were there first, We had to get Our own coffee and refills , same as beach bar the bar tender would ignore Us wait on locals first ,  not very attentive which is silly as Us Gringos tip. First time in Mexico this has happened I am You serve who ever is first no priority. Rooms are clean lots of hot water, no decks only few on front, bar closes at 10;30. DO Not go for night life!!  Town or beach bars You will hardly see any one about. It was perfect!!  Beach club here is amazing one of the best"
40,"First off, it is a small hotel which means the buffet is not as large and varied as the mega resorts.  This was the only area which we were not highly satisfied but as the local restaurants were outstanding it was not an issue.  And we understand that with the small number of visitors there is no good reason to have a large buffet.    Back to the hotel, the staff was great and accommodating but were not all fluent in English, we know enough Spanish to get by so that is not an issue.  While we were there the weekend was semi-busy with what looked to be local Mexican families who were having a great time.  I would say if there was more than a half dozen Americans there I would be surprised.  Other than the weekend I would estimate the hotel no more than 20% booked.  The pool near"
40,Very nice small quant place The staff was accommodating but had language barrier. We were very pleased to be offered a room with a king bed and ocean view instead of beds put together and 4 walls to look at.  Every evening had the sun set if we were in the room. The ocean is rough there but has 3 other places u can go to if wanting to go in the ocean. The shore is long. Did not walk all of it when there. The buffet meals not the best and not much variety but it's a small place. Breakfasts were great thanks Salvador for great omelettes.To the cleaning staff 5star as they keep everything nice and clean threw the resort. There were 2 places we went out to eat the Mediterraneana pizza and split coconut which were both very good. Pretty much the only thing that bothered us was no
40,"As everyone has said, the grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The Coco Beach Club is a great place to spend the day and totally relax.  Its not fancy, but its clean, quiet, and very restful.  Eduardo in the main dining room at night was terrific as were most of the wait staff.  There are just a few negative things I wish to acknowledge.  The first one is the stairs and no ramps. My husband has to walk with a cane and had a hard time navigating the stairs (especially the ones with no hand rail). The second was the television.  With half of the guests from either Canada or the US they only had 1 English channel (Fox news) and once in a while an English movie with Spanish subtitles.  They could use 2 or 3 more.   This was our first"
40,"The hotel and grounds are as lovely and well maintained as the photos show. The location overlooking the massive beach is amazing and the sunsets are breathtaking.  The hotel is all inclusive but it is relatively small and a 2 hour drive away from the huge resort area of Huatulco.  Do not expect massive American style buffets, an activities team and constant entertainment.  I loved the food and really enjoyed the wonderful selections and Mexican flavors.The restaurants were all open air and clean. My room on the third floor was beautifully renovated, clean, comfortable, quiet and a great sleep with the window open to listen to the ocean waves all night. The air conditioning worked well but I preferred hearing the ocean instead. The beach club area (at the bottom of over 100"
40,"We stayed for 14 days.  The resort is a very quiet, relaxing place.  The view of the long beach is spectacular!  This resort is definitely a 3 star hotel sitting on a 5 star property.  They have rocking chairs where everyone would sit and watch the beautiful sunset every evening.  The property sits approximately 80 feet above the ocean so we whale watched daily!  I loved it!  There's a long set of stairs to the beach area.  You had the option to take a shuttle.  We climbed the stairs every day for exercise.  The beach is beautiful with plenty of palapas and shady areas to sit and not burn.  We swam in the ocean.  There's a small area that is safe to swim in.  I loved watching the pelicans sitting on the rocks fishing.  Also, there was a baby turtle release just down the beach"
40,"New hostel, these guys are trying !:-),.. What they lack in amenities is made up for by their enthusiasm. A/C in rooms from 10Pm to 5AM, helps alot. Three floors to the bar, good exercize. Very knowledgeable about what is happening in town,.. Bargain place."
50,"I checked into Hotel Tabachin, situated behind the easy-to-find Hotel Sta Fe on Zicatela Beach, planning to stay for a week and ended up staying over a year.  I tried several rooms and then my dog and I settled into the ""old penthouse"" on the third floor with one of the best ocean views across the palm trees.  Tabachin's location, near the walking street The Adoquin and all the restaurants and beach walking and surfing on Zicatela beach, was great for me.   Being there long term, the best thing about the hotel was the staff, always helpful and supportive in every way, and the hotel owner, Paul Cleaver, who has his own great sense of humor and a personal memory disk full of wonderful stories of old literature, new books, world travel, human psychology, and a host of other topics."
40,"We just spent an enjoyable five days at the Posada Real in Puerto Escondido.  Property is along a beach, has beautiful views, and is well managed.  The food is good.   The various swimming pools are kept clean.   Some rooms are being renovated. Despite the labor problems and road blockages in some parts of Oaxaca State, everything was functioning well in Puerto Escondido. At the checkout, which was quick and efficient, we left the suggestion to include ice cream in the lunch and evening buffets.   Nearby is a beach where baby sea turtles are released at about five in the afternoon."
10,"Perfect location, terrible hotel! The location is amazing, by the ocean, with a large part of beach reserved and 4 swimming pools. BUT the hotel needs to be restored: the room was clean, but very old and the bathroom was definitely terrible. Our tariff was 'all inclusive' but NEVER DO THAT, as dinner is horrible and breakfast is even worse. If you want to live the Puerto Escondido atmosphere, this is definitely not the right place for you."
50,"We stayed in this hotel a couple of times, and we would recommend it to al our friends.  The two large apartments (the old penthouse & the penthouse) are really big rooms with high ceilings AC and ceiling fans. This is a very big plus because it can get very hot in Puerto.  The kitchen and bathroom are basic but clean. Both apartments have a balcony with a great view of the beach.  The breakfast is excellent and lasts all morning. It is a good place to sit and talk to other travellers and residents. The only downside is that you can’t eat there for lunch or dinner.  Although this is not a budget place, it is a pleasure to stay in the room or “hang” on the balcony, and the excellent breakfast makes its definitely affordable."
40,great place to stay while visiting puerto escondido. the large studio has plenty of room for your boards and other junk. AC blew cold and strong and the rooms were clean and stocked. the breakfasts were tasty and filling [maybe sometimes too much food]. morning conversations were priceless.  thanks pat! 
50,"The suites have well stocked kitchenettes and bookshelves filled with books.  There is also cable TV and free wifi if you bring a laptop.  Paul, or Don Pablo, also has a computer on site that you can use.  It is probably the best place to eat breakfast in all of Puerto Escondido.  Breakfast is included in the price of the room and is served by a friendly staff, family style.  Sometimes I would sit and talk for hours with Paul and other guests.   Pauld is English/Spanish speaking and is extremely helpful in making your stay as comfortable as possible.  Rooms are decorated with tiles and other mexican nick nacks.  The rooms feel very homey.  Just the right kind of place to sleep late or take that afternoon siesta.  The Tabachin is awesome.  I reluctantly write this because I want"
50,"What a wonderful place. The rooms are unique. My room had a 360 degree view with 250 degrees spectacular view of the ocean and surfer beach. Breakfast is included with the room and I would defy anyone anyplace to put forth a better and more varied choice. The breakfast would be memorable if there was a charge but guests at the Tabachin have this meal included in their room fee. The food is one thing however the breakfast experience is accentuated  with new guests being brought into conversations. Several threads of subject fly around the table. There is a treasure of experienced locals usually in attendance who will share their experiences in local history, recommendations and Spanish Language. The guests are usually repeaters and international conversations with them are  sure"
50,"The Tabachin lives up to its billboard......splendid breakfasts with organic coffee, oranges, books, and conversation!  After an uncomfortable, overnight bus ride, my daughter and I disembarked on a dusty street in downtown Puerto Escondido. A short taxi ride took us down a seemingly dead-end backlane......we tentatively turned the corner and walked into a true oasis! Paul, the owner, was sitting at the head of a long dining table, surrounded by tropical foliage and welcome shade. Within minutes, we were seated at the table with a cup of coffee and a glass of freshly-squeezed orange juice!  Since it was low-season, we had the choice of any of the six suites. We decided to stay in the ground-floor suite....it had a functional kitchen with granite countertops, a comfortable living"
50,"Paul Cleaver's Studios Tabachin del Puerto is a welcoming and relaxing retreat. Great food, friendly guests and lively conversation welcomed us to the breakfast table each morning. The local coffee, chili rellenos and fruit pancakes are amazing. Paul is a friendly, accomodating and knowledgeable host. He had another steel security gate installed during our stay. We certainly felt security was adequate with locked gates, a night watchman and an electronic wall safe in the room. Our stay at Tabachin was worry free and trouble free while being fun, informal and very relaxing. "
50,"I recently stayed at Tabachin for 5 nights and, as always (this was my fifth visit there), it was a welcoming and lovely place to be. Paul is a fantastic host: kind, entertaining, opintionated, and knowledgeable.  And he is constantly making Tabachin better and better - new tile work in the patio and rooms is so beautiful, and new security gates and a night watchman are very comforting, although I have never had a problem with security there in the past.  I am looking forward to my next visit.  (and the banana pancakes MUST be ordered at breakfast, YUM!) "
50,"The Tabachin Hotel is a  small six room bed and breakfast overlooking beautiful Puerto Escondido. Every spacious room has a/c, cable tv, kitchen, wireless internet , and is beautifully tiled and decorated. You will also find books in case you forgot yours. Your host Paul is a generous, kind man who sits with all the guests each morning for a fantastic breakfast included in the price of the room. Check their menu online to see the choices for the best breakfast in Puerto ! But don't be surprised if you stay 2 hours or more enjoying the food and conversations at the communal breakfast table. Very enjoyable. I stayed in the penthouse, an amazing room with commanding views and a wraparound tiled balcony where you can sip a cold corona and watch the sunsets, which set in a blaze of"
50,"I stayed at Tabachin for 2 months in October and November 2006. It was the most magical place - my own apartment but breakfast provided! The breakfast community was always fascinating, the owner extremely acommodating and the staff very friendly. The rooms were kept spotless, a balcony to lay out on, plenty of books to read, all tucked away behind Hotel Santa Fe. It is within easy reach of the beaches and the town but in a very private location and is highly recommended! I had a wonderful time there. "
50,"We've spent 42 days in Puerto Escondido at Villa Lili over the past three winters and never had to cancel plans due to bad weather. And it's a good thing, because there is so much to enjoy in this picturesque town with dozens of excellent places to eat and five distinctive beaches within walking distance (or a 30 peso taxi ride). A large part of the reason we love going there has been our hostess Adelena who also serves as tour consultant, recreational director, restaurant critic, local historian and amateur rare orchid cultivator. Special moments on our past trip saw us kayaking near dusk at the nearby lagoon, taking in the PuertoFest blues festival, catching sunset after beach volleyball on Zicatela, and the spectacular Valentines Day fireworks display at nearby, Chila. We"
50,"Villa Lily is a beautiful and quite boutique hotel, with an open kitchen and bar, a refreshing pool and relaxing music playing in the background. It is s very safe and clean place, situated only a short walk from Carrizalillo Beach and the restaurants on the main boulevard.  Every morning we had a freshly cooked Mexican breakfast, which was delicious. Adelina, the owner, is very friendly and helpful, willing to give suggestions about things to do and places to eat.   Had a wonderful time at Villa Lily and would highly recommend it.  Can`t imagine a place with better value!!!"
50,"Beautiful small hotel with very nice pool and bar area and wonderful personnel. We stayed in Villa Llilly only for two nights, moving from Quinta Lilli (hotel owned by the same people – Adelina and Luis). We got a fabulous room with the spectacular view on the ocean and with the separate bathing room with big jacuzzi and fountain. The breakfast were delicious. Adelina - the owner is very friendly, helpful person. She is helping to arrange trips and tourist attraction such as releasing to the ocean newborn turtles or boat trips to admire dolphins or birds. She also is willing to recommend some local restaurants or dishes and I must admit we weren’t disappointed in any of her recommendations."
50,"We have been to Puerto Escondido 14 times since 1990 and we really like Quinta Lili. The rates are great, the rooms are big and nice and the breakfasts are sumptuous and yummy.  We loved our stay at Villa Lili.  We we there for 12 days  and do not want to leave.  There was a taxi waiting for us at the airport . Ade, Luis and their staff take care of you and give deep care to the grounds and units.  The grounds are both lush and spotless.  There are 2 pools. One pool is good for kids to wade and the other is a 20 meter lap pool.   We were an extended family with 4 adults, 2 kids and an infant. One couple had the penthouse and the family had Balcony Room B with a King size bed and 2 single beds for the kids. There are 2 fans in that room, which is good as it gets pretty hot in"
50,"Great location near Carizalillo beach and the Rinconada.  Fabulous breakfasts cooked fresh outdoors.  Artsy rooms with comfy beds.  Best of all, your host Adelina is always there to help with any travel needs you may have.  This is a warm, welcoming place.  "
10,"We had a really HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE staying at this ""hotel"", they treated is horrible. First of all, they forgot to pick us up from the airport and didnt even apologize, even when they confirmed a couple days earlier they would do so as it was ""complimentary"". Aside the fact that the bed's sheets were dirty (yucky) and the towels were torn with big holes in them, we stayed in the ""palapa"" room at the top of the house and there is not even a phone to call someone (there's not even a lobby person who'd be available 24/7). The day we left we didn't even have help to carry the luggage 3 floors down and there was no way to contact someone without going down at least 3 floors. We had an elder lady (72 yr old) visiting and the man at the door didnt know we were actually staying there"
50,"We spent 1 week at this exquisitely designed small hotel in early February, 2014.  We had a large room with a balcony from which we enjoyed the glorious sunsets.  Breakfast, served under a shady palapa poolside, consist of amazing fruit along with a hot daily Mexican breakfast dish, made with beautifully prepared local recipes and ingredients.  The serene, grandmotherly Irene presides over the stove top, giving each guest her warm individual attention.  Puerto Escondido has a scarcity of waterfront accommodation located on calm swimming beaches, so the clean, beautiful pool at Villa Lilli makes possible those quick early morning and pre-dinner dips that are the icing on the cake of a tropical holiday.   When the time is right, a selection of amazing beaches with safe swimming"
50,"My husband and I stayed at the Villa Lili on a trip to Puerto Escondido for a wedding.  We were very pleased with the service before we even arrived.  The staff was extremely helpful-they even helped us book our plane tickets from Mexico City to Puerto Escondido.  Everyone there was very nice and accommodating.  The breakfast every morning was delicious.  One of the greatest parts was the easy walk to the best swimming beach-Carrizalillo. With Adelina's help, we ate at great restaurants close by and went on an awesome fishing trip with Omar.  We couldn't say more nice things about Adelina, she takes great pride in making sure all our her guests are well taken care of, and we appreciated everything she did to make our vacation so wonderful."
50,"So sad to be back in the freezing winter environs of Chicago.We spent 12 days in Puerto with Adelina, the wonderful hostess,and the whole staff at Villa Lili.Still can't say enough about the warm atmosphere and welcome we get here.This was our third February stay since 2012.Feels like a home away from home.We feel so secure here that we don't even bother locking our room door.Adelina,Irena,Sylvia and Francisco bring such a great feeling of joy and happiness to the casa.Seems that they are always laughing and joking around during their workday which is really infectious.It says alot about the type of hospitality on hand here that they offer an honor system full service bar,which we always take full advantage of :)Breakfast is of course the first wonderful stop in days filled with"
50,"Great location, very friendly and attentive staff, and delicious Oaxacan breakfasts! We had a wonderful time relaxing at Villa Lili and didn't want to leave! Highly recommended, hopefully we'll be back soon."
50,"What a find! A beautiful bungalow, a short walk from the nicest beaches in Puerto Escondido. Coffee, breakfast, the gardens, the shops and restaurants near by; all top notch. And the staff! All of their help and recommendations were invaluable. We really enjoyed our stay in PE and deciding to stay here had a lot to do with that."
50,"We had breakfast there in a lovely garden setting, amidst sculptures and painting, and wonderful plantings. The sheltered table area was perfect in case it rained (does it ever rain there?) and the food was excellent."
50,"We stayed for a week in the king sized bungalow.  It was so quiet and peaceful in the beautiful garden.  We enjoyed sitting on our terrace or lying in the hammock, enjoying the plants, trees and works of art.  The breakfast every morning was a delight, the sound of the fountain, delicious food and friendly service was outstanding. Our room was very clean and maintained daily. The location was superb, a short walk to the lovely restaurants of La Rinconada and another short walk to the beach. I would recommend this hotel!"
50,my favorite place to stay in puerto escondido.  beautiful garden and great breakfast.  I've been staying here for many years and always are drawn back.  very convenient to my favorite beach and plenty of restaurant choices near by. you will leave this place with a warm feeling.
40,"We stayed in the king sized bungalow. The bungalow and hotel grounds are beautiful and well kept. This hotel's goal for its guests is to ""unplug and get away"", so there is no TV and no AC. If that is what you are looking for, then this place is perfect for you."
30,"Coming in, I knew there would be no AC. I thought that I could tolerate this since I stayed on the beach in the Philippines without AC. But this is different. That building was a hut made of bamboo and this one was a concrete building. The building absorbs a lot of heat and remains hot throughout the night. The fan is strong, but without AC and a room that probably hovers around 32 C you will be very hot. I think for the price I paid, they should provide it.  Otherwise the room is clean and very close to shops and good restaurants. The fabulous beach is a short walk. The WIFI was good. I would also have liked curtains for the shower because water gets everywhere, and a small fridge for each room or at least one large fridge for all the guests."
50,"My boyfriend and I were here in August and stayed in the king bed Suite. The room was clean, simply but beatuifully decorated with a small ceiling fan. This hotel is extremely good value, especially considering the location (5mins from the beach) and the wonderful gardens which are great to relax in. The breakfast is simple toast and coffee, with the option of larger breakfasts which you pay additionally for. The chilaquiles were spectacular! The one and only downside is that if you are not used to the heat this time of year you may find it hard to sleep at first (the fan just moves the hot air around) but you quickly get used to it."
50,"We stayed at Villa Mozart y Macondo in December 2014 for 5 days. We were lucky enough to stay in one of the villas in the middle of the garden. It was exactly what we wanted: quiet, close to the beach, comfortable and not overpriced. It "
40,"A nice clean place with very friendly staff located on the Rinconada.  The breakfast included is simply coffee, bread and jam.  Anything else is extra.  There are simply better priced locations to be had."
50,"We loved Villa M & M, my husband and I had the larger, apt unit on second flood, kitchen, bath/shower, sitting room, bedroom, two small balconies, all artful and comfortable, our son had ground floor basic room that also was fine We loved the garden, great care to all the tropical plants, some fruiting, others colorful, where breakfast served. Host Manfred a very interesting, thoughtful and helpful person we had fine conversations with, and all the staff sweet and attentive, while none of it was costly or 'upscale' in the sense of everything being just like America, it was better than that, interesting and comfortable and not expensive. Highly recommend."
50,"Casamar Suites is an Oasis within the La Punta area of Zicatela Beach.  The grounds are pretty and the staff are wonderful. The rooms are nicely appointed and very clean, and the pool is inviting after the day at the beach.  One should keep in mind that parts of Mexico like Puerto Escondido are charming rather than luxurious, so the area won't appeal to every type of traveler. Casamar Suites was easily the nicest hotel in the area and perhaps is all of Puerto Escondido.   The beach nearby has Waves which our 13, 14 and 16 year old boys loved, but smaller children would likely find them too big.  Just down the beach you can rent chairs and umbrellas for cheap, and they bring drinks and food all day long. Daniel would see us coming and always had a cold drink and warm smile for"
50,"Disclaimer:  I did not stay at this property but they allow outside guests in to attend yoga and water aerobic classes.  I'm writing to RAVE about the instructor of both of these activities.  Nora is a lovely young woman who I looked forward to seeing each morning for class.  She's bright, knowledgeable about her teaching/craft, generous and caring.  She kept the classes interesting and as a newcomer to yoga, I learned a lot and felt wonderful after each class.  Based on my experience with Nora, I am looking to continue to practice yoga at home."
50,"This is a beautiful place to stay, the staff is very welcoming and knowledgeable of the different activities in Puerto Escondido.  It was my third time at Casamar and I sent some friends there and everybody felt safe and welcomed. "
40,"This was our 4th visit to Casamar suites, and again we were not disappointed. Our room was comfortable, staff was accommodating and friendly. The staff are always making improvements to the property - we are always amazed  at the quality of the work. We enjoy the activities offered to guests: yoga and Aquafit. The meet and greet gathering each week is a wonderful way to get to know all the guests and the staff! We will be back!"
50,"lovely setting, very nice rooms, perfect staff and management...  it is so good that people come back many times over .. very safe, clean, quiet;  free coffee waiting in the morning,  good breakfast and lunch;  not chlorinated swimming pool."
50,Suites surround pretty gardens and pool. Daily yoga classes are great and complimentary. Food and juices for breakfast and lunch were very nice and served in the garden around the pool. Staff work hard to ensure a very pleasant stay. 
50,"This was our second time staying at Casamar as we had such a great experience there the first time a couple years earlier. We stayed for two weeks this trip. The rooms are clean, the grounds are well taken care of and you can tell the staff take pride in their work. We stayed in Cocos which has a private patio with a perfect view of the ocean. We loved that there is now a kitchen by the pool where you can get free morning coffee and order food if you don't feel like cooking in your room or leaving the gorgeous grounds. It is hard to leave the grounds as it is so peaceful sitting by the pool with the beautiful flowers, palm trees and well manicured lawns. The staff are very nice, helpful and make you feel at home. The location is great only 2 blocks from the beach and a few"
40,"The suites are lovely, the staff are friendly and the breakfast was delicious. We spent two nights in the suite and were sad to leave the beautiful place. I really recommend the beaches close by and pepe's taco shack on the beach. Well worth a stay here. "
50,"My first time to La PUNTA and we loved it . We stayed through the Holidays. The staff is so helpful and sweet . Some of the staff speaks English. The kitchen cooks a real good meal and fresh coffee is ready in the morning . The grounds at Casamar are kept up and so Beautiful , a real little paradise. Hanging around the pool , swimming and lounging was delightful. Yes you can walk down to eaters or cab cheaply anywhere you would like to eat or see. I am a animal lover and many travelers brought their pets , pets are welcome. They pretty much roam freely. Also another thing , it is a keyed gate entrance for those who might be concerned about security and safes in rooms . Yoga was perfect ! "
50,"We had a suite and it was great! The rooms were spacious, very comfortable and clean. The hotel was a couple of minutes walk from the beach and about five minutes to La Punta bars and restaurants which we're cool. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the staff were very helpful."
50,"New kitchen staff has greatly improved food! CocoThai grill is excellent with freshest of ingredients. Three pools give great choices of lounging/sunning. Totally open 17 miles of beachfront sand to walk and explore. Local Puerto Escondido and Chila village offer great colonial Mexico with the safest environment. You will find no barbed wire, door&window bars and no gfaffitti here. "
10,"Last week we spent three days in this resort. The apartments are very nice, but food and beverages were horrible. This resort is far away from Town, more than 30min by car. The apartments are well equipied with a nice kitchen, but the convinience store has less than minimum to prepare a meal. The resort has two restaurants, the principal had a very bad service, we spent at least one hour to be served and when complaining, the answer was ""we have a certification 'Distintivo H' in process and we can't do anything, take it or leave it"". The next Day we went to the Tai Restaurant, they didn't have anything from the menu, and when served, fish was raw. The worst thing was in the pool bar, my daughter asked for a virgin piñacolada, and the waitress served a rum piña colada to a 11"
20,"I wish someone would have written a review like the one I’m about to write before I booked this place.  I gave it two stars, the first one earned by clean rooms and pools and the second one  earned by one staff member (Teresa) that was helpful and nice. Thank you Teresa for helping me with my last minute tour and actually showing compassion and customer service.   Other than that this was terrible experience because of what was important to me.  As soon as we arrived to the resort and finding out about disappointments I wanted out of my reservation after the first night and they didn’t let me out of it saying I would be charge for the 4 nights. I stayed unhappy the whole time...now that I’ve checked out I read another review with the exact same situation and he stated on his"
30,"Beautiful location, lacking in customer service.  Elevator out and we were on the 4th floor, for a week-made things difficult.  Daily services not to standard (e.g. ran out of toilet paper and had to fetch from office at midnight-dark and scary) and front office didn’t take care of the problem."
40,"Vivo Resort was great.  It’s close to the airport and far away from any kind of busyness.  We arrived and were greeted with lemonade and a great tour of the facilities and our room.  The apartment was fantastic, fully equipped with everything you could need with a great ocean view.  The apartment was super clean as were all the facilities we used.  The pools were family friendly and there was always a lifeguard present.  The water looked clean and the surrounding gardens well cared for.  The beach area was great, clean, no rubbish and no cigarette ends lying around.  As the water in this area is generally quite wavy there was always a lifeguard at the ready to warn people if they were overly adventurous.  Everyday the flying fish gave us a display of their capabilities.  We"
40,"As we flew in to Puerto Escondido airport we could see Vivo resort in the distance. We arrived at VIVO, and shown to our villa. We toured the grounds, put on our bathing suits and headed to the beach. My first time to the Pacific, it didn’t disappoint. The beach is beautiful the surf is rough. We enjoyed the pools, the clubhouse, the gym the restaurants and overall we had a great time. It’s a first class resort."
50,"I have been to Vivo numerous times and on each visit I discover more and do more.  On this trip we visited Rio Grande o Peidra Parada and Chacahua.  Wow.  Rio Grande is a great town and we had a fantastic meal and traveled on to a small town called Iglesia Santiago and  took a boat across a huge lagoon to Chacahua.  Wow, what a beautiful beach and wonderful community.  We spent a good part of the day swimming and eating fresh sea food.  Vivo is a great centralized location to travel to so many wonderful places.  Our stay at Vivo was awesome like it always is.  Good food and good people, they even have Pizza night and a Thai Food restaurant.  On this visit I actually had to work and had no problems with wifi in the business centre.  Life is good."
50,I had an amazing vacation! The condo was lovely with a beautiful view of the ocean and the sunrise. The bed was comfortable and the decor was stunning. The staff were all very helpful and provided excellent service. The sales staff was exceptional! Puerto Escondido is a very quaint little city. Would highly recommend Vivo Resorts. Fond memories! I hope to return! :):)
50,"Me and my family stayed in that wonderful hotel the week before the first easter holiday week. It was a perfect week in a gorgeous environment - a nerd could complain about the low internet in the 3rd floor rooms, but to be honest for me this was perfect to get my head free of work... All the rest was perfect! "
40,"The resort offers a mix of privately owned condos which run at 250.000 and 300.000 usd for the 1 and 2 bedrooms and hotel rooms for hire.   Comfortable apartments, well furnished. Excellent for families with smaller children. Three pools. Beautiful empty beach. Turtles. Good for surfing not swimming.   Restaurant food is the worst I have had anywhere in Mexico and I live here at the moment and have been around quite a lot. "
50,"Great facilities, location and staff. Breakfasts were delicious. Staff were exemplary in their warmth and kindness and willingness to talk about available activities.  Good selection of cafes and restaurants nearby and 5 minute walk to the closest beach.  Would go back in a heartbeat!"
50,"We stayed at Quinta Lili at the beginning of Semana Santa, and I couldn't recommend it more highly. We decided to stay in the master suite, which is an incredible room on the top floor of the five-room hotel. It was wonderful, with ocean views on three sides, including from a private Jacuzzi from which we could watch the sunset over the sea. The suite also has a nice little attic with lounge chairs, perfect for reading when you need a break from the sun. The room was very comfortable, and we thought it was worth the splurge. The room is decorated with colorful tiles and has lots of fans to accompany the breeze that is usually blowing off the sea.  The rest of the property is also quite nice, and the hospitality of the owner and staff was the best part. Magdalena prepared great,"
50,"We couldn't have enjoyed our stay at Quinta Lili more. The staff was friendly, helpful, and available (but never pushy or in your way!). There is a free service from the airport to the hotel, making arrival easy and without stress. We arrived for our honeymoon, and the staff had put flower petals everywhere! The room was beautiful and just like its pictured and the private Jacuzzi was absolutely sublime. The relaxed, laid back atmosphere makes you feel like your coming home every night when you return to the hotel. No reception phone to call to every little thing you need. In the late afternoon/evening you won't even find staff at the hotel, adding to the feeling of being ""at home"" but making occasional little wants/needs a little less convenient. The Mexican breakfasts every"
50,"I really lucked out by staying at Quinta Lili! The environment is so bright and calm it immediately puts you in a relaxed mode. The rooms and public area where we ate and swam were kept clean , that means so much to me! Adelina was so helpful with recommendations and a map that she customized according to what we wanted to do . Magda is the sweetest and made us coffee and delicious breakfast every morning. I really loved the stocked honor system bar, it was so nice to come in from a long day of the beach and grab a beer for the shower! We looked at other hotels in the surrounding area and Quinta Lili was by far the most tranquil and spotless! I cant recommend staying here enough it was a really great experience !"
50,"When on the Oaxaca coast, stay at Quinta Lili! An amazingly comfortable and hospitable bed and breakfast on the southern Mexico coast. We find it the perfect relaxed atmosphere we need, with gracious hosts, a nearby friendly swimming beach, warm breakfast ready as we wake up, wonderful walks, and great nearby restaurants! We will return to Quinta Lilli every time we travel to the city of Oaxaca and have time for a week at the beach—a dream we hope for every year! A+ for this experience."
50,"Quinta Lili is a delightful small hotel in a quiet, residential neighborhood with quick & easy access to the strip of shops and restaurants on Benito Juarez Blvd, and quick & strenuous access to stunningly beautiful Playa Carrizalillo (the beach is a very short walk and 170 steps down, and oh what a view at the top of the steps!).  The hotel is beautifully but simply decorated, incredibly relaxing.  Adelina, the co-owner, is completely charming and there for anything you need, want to arrange, advice, or just conversation about the area.  Magdalene and Sylvia have the warmest smiles and cook the best traditional breakfasts, something different each day.  When you stay at Quinta Lili you feel at the same time both a member of the family and a favorite guest - the hospitality is"
40,This was our second time to go at Quinta Lily. We liked the Sunrise room with the nice balcony. Adelina is really helpful and always there for us. My husband twist his foot and she went put of her eay to get pills. Even offered to bring us to hospital! You are safe to stay there. Walking distance to beach and restaurants. Place is simple and don't expect high luxury. Place is clean and great mexican breakfast. Very healthy food. Mucho gracias Adelina. You are very good hostess.
50,"A great quiet spot with a wonderful breakfast.  Close to Playa Carrizalillo and the other west side beaches.  Many great restaurants just a few blocks away.  The service was wonderful from airport pickups to advice on tours, activities and restaurants all of which was spot on.  Adeline and Magda were delightful."
50,"Really nice place, very quiet and relaxing environment. The service and the breakfast are the best, everyday there is a different option of traditional Mexican food. The rooms are clean and beautiful, in each rooms there is a differential. Excellent support and recommendation of restaurants and different kind of activities. Totally recommended!!!"
50,"What a lovely relaxing oasis.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, in such a beautifully maintained house.  Magda and Adelina also made the week very special.  Magda's breakfast and smiles started off our mornings.  Adelina with great recommendations for restaurants, help with sightseeing, and things to do, and organizing transport to airport.  Not to mention easy going attitudes, and always ensuring we were happy and well looked after.  would highly recommend my stay to friends, family.  You won't be disappointed."
50,"We enjoy our stay here, this place was clean and comfortable we felt like home. This the place to stay if you are in puerto, beach is super close and restaurants around can't complain. Thank you we really enjoyed our stay "
50,"We stayed one night in the Terraza Suite, which has a stunning terrace overlooking the beach—the perfect spot to watch the sunset. I highly recommend this suite, even if only for a night (but we certainly would've stayed longer).   This small and simple hotel could not be better located. Just walk down the private staircase (which was not nearly as precarious as some of the other reviews suggest) to the gorgeous Playa Carrizalillo. The Oaxacan coast has many gorgeous beaches, but this one stands out for being one of the few that is consistently calm and swimmable.   The hotel let us borrow their surfboards for the morning at no extra charge. Pretty much everyone else on the beach was renting their equipment by the hour (and worried about getting back on time) so it was nice to"
50,"We were here for lunch for 4 days in a row, simply becoz the environment was so pleasant and food was amazing!  Food we tried and rated 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 - fish burger: nice and fresh, with big portion - prawn pasta: BEST! Prawns were so fresh and big! Pasta was cooked in perfect wine sauce! We loved it  - skirt beef sandwich: beef was tender  - jugó: freshly blended!   View: overlooking the ocean and watching ppl learning surfing was best spot!   Please come and enjoy the great time! Highly recommend :) "
50,"I stayed 4 nights in the Terraza room with my partner.  Full kitchen facilities, king bed, tiled bathroom, and huge veranda overlooking the bay. There are about 100 steps going down to the beach, so if you're not in shape or have difficulty walking, you will have trouble getting down there.  That being said, we would go for a swim and surf, head back up for breakfast (order room service) and eat on the balcony, and back down to the beach on and off throughout the day.  We went to the market for lunch, and to pick up fruit and veggies very cheaply.  Dinners in Mexico are from 3-5pm (Comida), but they do cater to the north american times there. You can rent surfboards for $10/day at the beach easily.  Taxis to the market are roughly $4 each way. We were going to take the bus from"
50,"10 days in paradise. Thank you Miya and team. We love this place;magical, hypnotic, wonderful in everyway. Most comfortable beds, fans, air conditioning... superb restaurant... amazing and would highly recommend. And the views... it could not be more beautiful."
50,"Visited on a Friday night, all five of us had awesome food and drinks. My friend said it was the best steak he has had in Mexico and he has visited many times. Awesome service, listened to a band play.  Felt a little young for the crowd at age 45 but who cares as it was amazing!"
50,"I'm hesitant to even review the Villas or Puerto in general as I honestly don't want it to become a huge tourist destination. Puerto is a ""Pueblo"" as they say, not a resort town, and that suits me perfectly fine. I loathe the day that large hotels abound and the authenticity is lost.  I first visited Puerto Escondido in 2003 when I bought a one-way ticket down to live the American dream by living on a small Mexican beach. It was during a multi-month stay at the Villas Carrizalillo that I met my wife, so it was only fitting that for our 10th anniversary we renewed our vows right there at the Villas. We were fortunate enough to rent the entire Villas complex (11 villas in total) which accommodated our closest friends & family for the event, so the stay was extra special to say the"
50,"Loved it! I'll admit when the driver turned off the road to the hotel I almost freaked out a little. There is no road leading to the hotel, in fact barely even a dirt track! But as soon as we we arrived my fears were put to rest. The receptionist was lovely and really helpful. Our room was not exactly luxurious, but it was clean and quirky with a really comfortable bed and a view that is simply breathtaking. The perfect little beach below is one of my favorites anywhere with clear, warm water, perfect weather, and cheap, cold Corona's served with a smile.  I can not recommend the restaurant highly enough. It is so affordable, and the food is as good as I've eaten anywhere. In fact we all agreed the shrimp taco's are probably one of the best things we had ever tasted. I'm almost"
50,"We went for cocktails and sunset and immediately decided to checkin the following night for 6 nights.  Perfect location to the best beach...easy steps down and back!  Great drinks and food and view and the accommodations are clean and perfect.  Thank you to so many of the staff for making it a perfect stay. Even Tequila the cat and his friend that we named Margarita were perfect.  The grounds are restful and relaxing. We have now booked 8 girlfriends to come back in February.  Such great location for walking to restaurants and bars and taxi are so cheap! Love the food, the people, the water in this little paradise"
50,"We really enjoyed our 11 day stay at Villas Carrizalillo. This boutique hotel has an amazing location overlooking the gorgeous Carrizalillo Beach, which in our opinion is the best swimming beach in Puerto.  The hotel has everything you need, a nice restaurant, bar and beautiful outdoor common areas. Our beautiful room (airconditioned) overlooked the beach & we fell asleep each night to the soothing sound of crashing waves. The hotel is located within walking distance of a cute little area with a general store, bars, laundry, salon & restaurants. Our favorite restaurant here is La Cafecita; Great food & bakery!  This hotel is also minutes away by taxi from Zicatela beach (famous surfing beach) for more shopping & eateries.  We really enjoyed the food at the Hotel Santa Fe.  We"
50,"i stayed 3 days at Davids house and really enjoyed the place and people I met there.  The room was really cute, the area quiet and the spot ideal for beginner / intermediate surfers. David is not running the camp for business but to share his passion; you can feel it everyday through his dedicated instructors team (forza ragazzi!).  I met other guys from all over the world and there was no way to stay alone for dinner; they were like old friends and we shared a lot of fun, I'll come back asap."
50,"I stayed at Davids place to learn to surf and I was so surprised at how fantastic it was.  I travelled for 6 weeks in Mexico always moving around and his was the best place I stayed in.  The room was great, the kitchen always clean, the area quiet.  The garden was really nice to relax in.  At night time you can fall asleep hearing the waves crashing and it was heaven.    We made a dinner one day altogether with all the instructors and they offered to take me on many trips.  They were so kind and welcoming.  It was my second time surfing - and those guys really helped me with their teaching. If I went back to the area I would certainly go back there - unbeatably the best place to stay in Puerto.  Thanks to David, Arron and Chicharron,"
50,"Puerto Surf House is the best place I have ever been :D it is super clean, the atmosphere is awsome, so relaxing, quiet and peaceful, David, Chicharron, Carlos were awsome instructors and I learned so much with them. They are super patient and help you catch the best waves. The surf house is located in a perfect spot right next to the beach and very good and cheap places to eat. I went alone but the people here were very friendly and welcoming. I would have loved to stay longer, however they had many reservations, but i will surely come back the next chance i have. Excellent excellent place to stay in puerto escondido :)  would recommend it to anyone :)"
50,"Not only the place is amazingly cheap, but is clean and nice. However, the best of the surf house is the people. Yet if you are an experienced surfer or you want to give it a first try, you can count on the team of the surf house that will assist you to take the most out of the experience! Great place to spend a weekend among friends!"
40,"Accommodation was ace and my room very clean.  Watch out you don't pay for hot water when they rarely have any. The garden is a lovely place to watch the butterflies and laze in a hammock.  Lessons I felt were hit and miss dependent on who you had on the day.  They are all very good at ensuring you catch waves and stand up, however, are reluctant to teach you how to catch waves independently.  If you are a first timer then great, but if you are wanting to advance a bit more then you need more explanation.  The surf house is close to a few places to eat otherwise you can catch a taxi into the bigger town."
50,"I couldn't possibly describe my stay at Puerto Surf. Me and my mom stayed there for two weeks. Puerto Escondido is a wonderful place, and La Punta is, in my opinion, the best part of it. No matter where I would go in the city, I would always be very happy to come back to the house. Everyday my mom and I would walk to the beach (only a few meters away) and watch the sunset, so magical and peaceful. The house has that vibe too, we didn't need to worry about finding things to do, hanging out around the house was so great, and we could lay in the hammocks and just relax. Everyone was very friendly, the instructors are great people and they are very good at their job. I never surfed before and was able to stand up on my first class. They are very worried about safety, too. I will"
50,"We had an amazing week in the surf house. It's only a few steps from the beach and from some little restaurants and stores. The place La Punta is quite small and quite, but a good surfing spot. Zicatela itself is much busier and more touristic.  We took surf lessons for one week, the teachers are very good and know exactly what they do. They are good in explaining, know the see very well and take good care of you if you are a beginner :-) Would surely go there again and can recommend it!"
50,"Puerto Surf is a very nice place, 1 block from the beach with only 5 bedrooms so it is a quiet place which is cool. You get to meet nice people, to chat with the surf instructors and David who runs the place in a relaxed and pleasant way. I'd love to go back there ! If you want to chill out, this is the spot."
50,"Not much else to say other than an amazing place to stay! David is the perfect host, who has created the perfect relaxing environment for guests.  There is no pressure for you to have lessons if you stay there, they will happily just rent you boards.   We will definitely be returning at some point!"
50,"I spent a week down there this July, I honestly didn't know what to expect. The minute we got there we knew it was going to be great, the house is awesome, great location, the people are THE BEST. The lessons were amazing and so much fun! Also our room was excellent, very tidy and homey.  I wish I could have stayed there longer, David and the guys are so nice and friendly.  Highly recommend this place! Gracias por todo David!"
10,So sad... I've stayed at this hotel over the years and our last stay was a disaster.  I reserved a suite during low season and on our second day the hotel was over run by a group of 50+. We had to leave because it was a ridiculous scene. Couldn't even get in the pool with 20 kids. They let them take over the kitchen and cook their own meals.  The owner who was away on business demanded we pay for the whole week! Haha. Right.  The town was dead and he insisted we were taking business from him with our reservation. I payed for the nights we stayed and he said he would call the tourist police. Don't stay here if you want to deal with bad business people.  I am saddened because this is a beautiful hotel that is now falling apart. The private suite kitchen is disgusting full of dirty
50,The hotel is great and close to the beach. All the employees are really nice and helpful. You will be able to enjoy the nice swimming pool while having your breakfast or lunch. The bedroom is great and the air condition works very well which is really important in order to sleep properly in Puerto Escondido.
50,"We are traveling on a budget and mostly staying at hostels, but when we arrived at our hostel in puerto escondido we found it unbearable and searched for something nicer. I'm so happy we found Hotel Paraiso Escondido! For only about $65 US per night my boyfriend and I got an enormous corner room on the 3rd floor with a comfy king size bed, a large luxurious bathroom and a gorgeous terrace with views of the lovely pool and the pacific! It also had AC which was a huge bonus since this is July and it's impossibly humid. The staff was super friendly and accommodating to us giving us a map, directions, and great recommendations including their suggestion of the night tour to lagoon de manialtelpec where we swam in a bioluminescent lagoon- a truly magical experience that our lonely"
50,"The hotel itself is a beautiful building with a lot of character. The communal areas are very pretty, with a lovely pool area and restaurant serving tasty Mexican food. We treated ourselves and upgraded  to the Master Suite and it was worth every penny. The bedroom is large, the beds comfortable, the bathroom clean, spacious and lit through the stained glass of a beautiful dome. But the absolute highlight is the fantastic terrace with views of the Pacific and its own splash pool. The only negative thing I would say about the room, and the property itself, is that there are no sun loungers on the terrace which makes it a little tricky to lie back and enjoy the sunshine. "
50,"Our extended family of 6 stayed in the ""villa"" which is slightly separate from the main hotel but on the grounds and very near the pool still. It was the perfect solution for our group, as we like to make our own coffee and breakfasts when we are travelling, when possible.  Beautiful outdoor covered patio with large couches and a view of the bay, which was a surprise. excellent airconditioning, excellent cleaning services daily, super friendly desk staff who gave great restaurant suggestions. We really preferred this part of town which is much more humble and family friendly than Zicatela, and felt like part of the regular town life when walking to and fro the beach which is only 5+ mintues walking from the hotel.  I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back!!"
50,"We stayed here many moons ago & I'm so pleased it's still going. Sitting on the terrace next to the pool having breakfast, whilst having humming birds come along a next to you........ what more can I say.  If you get a chance to stay here... DO!! It's near town & the beach but so quiet & peaceful. The staff were fantastic & the views even better."
50,"I was just at the Paraiso Escondido and I can honestly it is one of the most charming hotels I've ever stayed in. The hotel looks like a cross between a moorish castle and a Spanish colonial mansion. The architectural and artistic touches are very beautiful.  I stayed at the Paraiso 12 years ago and the ambiance was as magical then as it is today. When the moon comes up over the bay and you stand on your balcony and marvel, you know you're staying at the right spot.  Sergio, the manager, and his assistant Daniella, made us feel very welcome and went out of their way to advise and to help; and the rest of the staff was helpful and friendly too. When I return to PE, and I know I will, I'll try first to stay at the Paraiso. And did I mention that the price was right?"
40,"In the middle of the town - a quiet and beautiful place - with at wonderfull oceanview, you will find this hidden paradise. We have been visiting Puerto Escondido and this hotel since 2007 - and still find it very charming with an extremely friendly staff. This year we stayed for nine days - and enjoyed all of them. Ufortunately the restaurant was not open. The architecture is very special: Mexico meets 1001 Night. The rooms are not luxurious but yours eyes will feast on all the little original details. We hope to se you again next year."
50,"This place is something really special that made our stay in Puerto Escondido into something extra. Sergio, the manager, is doing a great job of running this place together with his team. They are pleasant, helpful and accommodating. We enjoyed it for nine days - the pool, the architecture, the ambiance, the staff etc. We would come back to Puerto Escondido just for the pleasure of staying here again."
50,"Rooms are air y,no air con requied. Rooftop pool and bar. Restaurant is 5 star.  Can only describe menu as FANTASMAGORICAL. The Hidden Cove has a hidden secret.                            aca.rik"
50,"Paraiso Escondido is a small, very idiosyncratic hotel with lots of charm and character. We were here once before, perhaps 20 years ago, and very little has changed, including the prices. One thing that was new to us is a group of third-floor suites. They cost a bit more than regular doubles, but they're well worth it. The small pool is clean and inviting. There are terrific views of the bay from just about everywhere, and Manager Sergio and his staff are helpful and courteous. This is not a resort-style, luxury hotel, nor is it right on the beach. But if you're looking for a relaxing couple of days, we'd recomment it."
40,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The hosts were excellent. The restaurant was great. Our rooms were simple , but clean and comfortable. It is a pretty place. We spent a lot of time on the roof overlooking the beach--in the pool, swinging in the hammocks, reading, sipping drinks served from the bar---a great place to be. It was a short walk to the beach and a short ride  to anywhere else. Thanks, Joanne and Paul for making us feel so ""at home""!  Hilde Neustaedter, Winnipeg MB, Canada"
40,"Good facilities, clean room, great food in restaurant, good location"
40,"This hotel was rather good choice for us as the purpose of our stay in Puerto Escondido was beach and birdwatching. The beach (swimmable) is very near to the hotel - ca 100-150 metres. Yes, the town centre is a bit further but we did not find it disturbing. Used a taxi couple of times and during the daytime it is a nice 15 minutes walk along the beach.  The only thing we did not like was the restaurant - it was a bit pricy and the food... Well would not eat there again. Otherwise the rooms were large, beach was near and if you got tired of the waves then there is also a pool on the roof. Would definitely stay there again."
50,"Had the pleasure of staying here in December 2009. Hosts Paul and Joanne couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful during my 3-night stay. Flor de Maria is, in my opinion, the best of all worlds in Puerto Escondido: it's on a quiet side street, away from the bustle of the main drag (not that PE ever gets too bustling...), but still just, literally, a few minutes walk to the main beach (which is spread out before you when on the rooftop terrace).   Beautiful interior courtyard, typical spotless tile everywhere, comfortable rooms, and as mentioned, a rooftop terrace with lounge chairs, small swimming pool, hammocks, a small bar and wonderful sunsets. And all for a most reasonable $55-60 a night US (and getting cheaper every day, it seems, thanks to the current battering the"
50,"This is the most charming hotell with superb location and lovely hosts! And the restaurant is topp class, no dought the best food in Puerto Escondido! Nothing is fancy, just very much at home, and very cosy atmosphere:)"
50,"The Flor de Maria is one of  Mexico's hidden treasures, a gem of a hotel with the world's friendliest owners and staff, nestled in Oaxaca's friendliest town. The Flor has the best kitchen in town and all the necessary amenities--pool, hammocks, bar and Wi Fi. It's become a second home to the many guests who return year after year from all over the world to renew their relationship with Puerto Escondido and with each other.  If what you're looking for is jet skis, casinos, air-conditioned rooms and satellite TV, Puerto is not for you, but if you like surfing, long walks on the beach, delicious food, amazing sunsets and guaranteed good weather, you won't be disappointed. Visit Puerto Escondido and stay at the Flor de Maria."
30,"This lodging is popular among non-Spanish speaking Canadians seeking a secure familiar refuge hosted by fellow Canadians. A taxi is required from this location to anywhere in Puerto Escondido after dark since the beach is dark and the highway dangerous for foot traffic. This property is not recommended for the more sophisticated international traveller because less expensive accomodations (in Mexican pesos)  are more conveniently located and offer a more cosmopolitan array of guests including Mexicans. The hosts quote room prices in dollars not pesos which results in a floating rate in pesos day to day. Rooms are simple, many very hot, and, in some cases, very noisy from the kitchen and roof deck. We recorded our experience in the guest book with a very hot room and then a"
50,"This was our 3rd visit at Paul and Joann's over the last 3 years and I can't imagine going anywhere else for a year end escape from the cold in Canada. This year our children, 26, 28, and 31, came as well for a week and after about ten minutes were completely sold on returning again. My wife and I stayed for 2 weeks and time flew even though we did nothing but relax and play in the water. Well located, wonderful visits with others from all over the World, food to die for and new friendships that will last for life. We will be returning next year."
40,"We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights  based on excellent Tripadvisor reviews. Our room was clean and pleasant, and the owners are personable and helpful. There is an upstairs terrace, with a bar, small pool, some hammocks and chairs (no loungers). The restaurant was excellent for dinner, although breakfast was very ordinary (much better across the street at the charming Los Caracoles).   One piece of information that does not appear in other reviews is that it is not safe to walk on the beach at night. As the hotel is on a street between the beach and a busy highway, this means that you must take a taxi to and from the hotel if you want to go anywhere at night - even for an after dinner walk. We would not return to the hotel for that reason - it felt somewhat claustrophic. The"
50,Ask for their Olas Shakshuka it’s the best in Mexico for lunch/breakfast. Highly recommend for stay and brunch. The hotel is top notch but you can also come just to sit and have breakfast or lunch. Highly recommended 
50,Great place to stay. Really chilled vibe and they have a nice rooftop where they give cool  yoga lessons 👌🏼 a quiet street but only a few minutes away from all the nice restaurants and the  beach   Would stay there again next time I’m in puerto Escondido 
50,"I spent over a month in Puerto Escondido and Casa de Olas was my favorite place to stay. The staff were so kind, friendly and made it feel like home. It was nice every morning to have coffee and breakfast provided. There is a ton of space to be outside to work, read or just hang out. Included in the stay you can use the tennis court which is well lit at night. The Italian chef makes an INCREDIBLE lasagna weekly which was delicious.   This was a perfect place for me and my partner to stay. We met lots of other really nice people and enjoyed the work out and yoga classes. Charlotte's classes are the best!"
50,You won’t regret it if you stay at Casa de Olas. The place is gorgeous and the service is excellent. All the staff is super nice and helpful and will make you feel at home instantly. Perfectly located in the center of the coolest area in Puerto Escondido minutes away from the beach and all the action you may want while offering a chill and tranquilo atmosphere. Big thumb up!
50,"Casa de Olas has everything you need for an amazing stay. The staff are welcoming and kind. It feels like family!  Adamo makes amazing food (try his lasagna!) and Monica makes superb drinks (try her frozen mojito!).  Efrane and Oliver take care of so many details, but in particular we had an incredible fishing trip with them.  Tennis, surf boards, bicycles, swimming pool, fitness classes, and so much more included with your stay.  I loved my time here and can't wait to come back."
50,"Casa De Olas is without a doubt the best hotel to stay at in La Punta! Photos do not this paradise justice.  The food & drinks (do not skip the lasagna or frozen mojitos), staff and the ambiance at this hotel are second to none. The rooms were comfortable and quiet, with impressive attention to detail and superb cleanliness. The staff members truly treat you like family, you will feel right at home from the minute that you walk in. The hotel is quiet and comfortable with something to offer for everyone - tennis & surf lessons, yoga, HIIT & boxing classes, a full gym, a clean and relaxing pool, easy access to restaurants/shops/beach, and two rooftop palapas with gorgeous views which were perfect environment for getting some work, meditation or reading done.  Wifi was consistent"
50,"Casa de Olas is an amazing place to stay at in Puerto Escondido, if you want a perfect cocktail of location, fusion of modern style and authenticity of local culture, serenity, impeccable cleanliness, the most kind and helpful staff and incredibly thoughtful curation of fitness, led by talented Margarita, Tommy and Martin, and food for soul:) YOGA classes were my highlight! True ninjas of yoga - Charlotte and Ozlem- will shower you with knowledge and beauty, as well as definitely kick your butt and throw a joke or two in a true British manner! All levels will feel comfortable🙏🏽 so much love for you!!! Also, do not forget to have some serious party in your mouth - provided by a beautiful Italian couple: Adamo - the chef, and his beautiful partner - Monica, who will make you any"
50,"Having worked in the hospitality service industry most of my career, I could not have been happier with the quality of the staff and service at Casa de Olas. Everyone from Gustavo and Flor in guest services to Adamo and Monica at the restaurant and bar to Efrane the fishing guide were always extremely helpful and willing to help. As a great supplement, Charlotte is an excellent yoga instructor in the palapa on the third floor and has several classes throughout the week. Additionally she’s a gem of a person and very helpful to newbie travelers. Her Self Care Sunday Class with Margarita is a must for any fitness / yoga oriented person visiting the area. Would highly recommend staying here for awhile! "
50,"My boyfriend and I spent 5 days here and felt at home from day 1! The staff is incredible - Flor at reception takes fantastic care of you and has the best recommendations, and Adamo and Monica are TOP NOTCH chefs and bartenders (literally the best lasagna and kiwi mojito we'd ever tasted).   The 'Self Care Sundays' are an absolute must when you stay here. Margarita and Charlotte are wonderful instructors and have created what seems to be quite the tradition in Punta now (multiple people attending lived nearby); an intense HIT class, followed by a deeply relaxing yin yoga session and topped off with a lovely breakfast.    The hotel itself is super clean, comfortable and is a great place to chill out. We spent way more time here than we anticipated. There is also a tennis court"
50,"A piece of heaven in the heart of la punta Zicatela <3  Came back from the beach just few nights a go and I can say already miss waking up and drinking some coffee whilst relaxing on the hammock.  This place is really beautiful, all of the spots round the hotel are warming and pretty, and have definitely been thought for you to spend a delightful stay, it has two terraces in which you may take yoga lessons in the morning or book a massage, pool is always kept clean and there are even books and reading area to relax.   I booked a room with a shared bathroom and must say that I was impressed by how clean the bathroom is kept all day, the room was comfy and bed super cozy, a mini fridge inside the room for you to keep snacks or drinks and all the staff are very nice and polite.  "
30,"We are staying here at Villa Sol for one week over New Year's. There are many good things about this hotel, the first being its low price. Second one being the lovely Beach Club, where we have been spending our days. To be clear, this hotel is NOT on the beach, as some of the photos might lead you to think. The beach is about a 10-15 min walk down the hill, or if you want to wait, there is a truck that will take guests back and forth. Not sure if there is a time attached to the truck rides, seems a bit random. Also, might be a bit tricky for people with disabilities? The beach itself is amazing, Uncrowded, wild, vast, and very large waves, so not really safe for kids, or elderly. It's a bit scary if you get caught in the surf. Very powerful. As for the hotel....it is an older"
50,"I stayed 4 night 5 days past January with all my family. I was a very nice and peaceful experience. I agreed with everybody “the beach club is amazing”.  The people there is very very nice and kind “you like places but you full in love with people”. The hotel is clean, very good deal for the price. The food is good and the pools are ok. The only recommendation I could make you is not to stay in the building that is near to the maintenance area because is kind of noisy.  I will come back for sure.  I want to thank for the music at the beach club ""Gepe/12 minerales/ Cerati /puente"" it was a magic moment."
50,"I stayed for 4 Nights at villasol hotel this past march. I checked many hotels in this town and i consider this the best deal available for the price: simple but clean and tidy. The highlight of this hotel is the beach club!!! Intimate, very nice pool, and really good service and food! Shrimp tacos are a must!!! I would absolutely come back to this hotel. "
10,We booked 2 rooms here fbeginning on Feb 16th fpor three nights. Our rooom was a junior suite with a balconey. The room we got was on the first floor looking onto a stairway that housed a housekeeping cart and no balconey.  Our first day enccountered no hot water and we could nevercould get an answer if it was gouing to be fixed. We moved our room the second morning. This room had no balconey and only an on/off switch for the AC.. The day did not proceed well. It took 6 hours to get a roll of toilet paper and when we came back from the beach the AC was not working. The same desk person smiled and said she would take care of it. An hour later no one had shown up and I went back to the desk and got the same smile from the desk clerk. This time I said I would wait in the lobby
40,"This is our third time at Villa Sol and I will be back next  year.  The hotel is clean and comfortable.  The staff are warm are extremely accomodating and gracious.  The highlight is the Beach Club experience with two pools and miles of beautiful sandy beach.  It is a wonderful place to sun bathe, read, relax or contract for a wonderful massage under the palapa to the sound of the surf. In short it is a place to relax.  If you are looking for the 5 star Hilton experience with glitz and glimmer this is not for you.  If you want to experience Mexico with many fine restaurants and a wonderful market, you will enjoy Villa Sol as much as we have."
30,"The high-light of this property is its beach club with pool, food and bar service. The grounds and beach are immaculate and it is very easy to spend the entire day there .... great to catch up on your reading. There is also Wi-Fi available here, and at the pool and gardens within the hotel, which is not accessible in all guestrooms due to the concrete construction.   This is an older property, soem items need repair but it is extremely clean. The staff are all very pleasant although not enough staff had been scheduled for a long holiday weekend.   Even though our confirmed Booking.com reservation stated that breakfast was included, it was not. And, after we had tried the buffet on the first morning, we were informed that we were only entitled to a contiental breakfast.  Having"
50,"The great thing about this hotel is the beach club, secluded with 2kms of pristine beach, no tourist. Great for contenplation and meditation. Te room is newly furnished from the last time i stayed here. Good food"
30,"Well, much like any other hotel in the area this one is old and not in great condition. Breakfast is a hassle due to having to go offsite and the food in general isn't even of average quality. The beach club is nice though."
10,"The staff destroyed my brand new surfboard and the manager said it was my fault!!!! Called me a lyer!!!! They put a bed over my board!!!! They also didn´t let us have breakfest in the hotel, we had to go all the way down to the beach club! The shower drain was stuck and the AC liking, and they didn´t change rooms nor tried to fix the problem! Very good structure but awful administration!!!!!!"
50,"Very nice hotel, with all the ammenities at a very good price. The rooms are nice and clean with AC and cable TV, the personnel is very friendly and helpful. The best part is definetly the beach club that is about 5 min walking distance or you can grab the shuttle that leaves from the hotel if you are lazy. The beach is also very nice with fewer people than Zicatela and a couple of local restaurants on the sand. Zicatela is about 10 min away in a taxi that costs around 30 pesos, so you can get there easily."
30,"beautiful location, nice pools and cheapish rates, nonetheless, the rooms are in great need of refurbishing and the food is rather bad.  ok for children and if you spend all day in the swimming pool. the staff is friendly and polite, just like anyone else in puerto escondido"
50,"One week in of 2 week stay, can't say enough. Family friendly, food is good, lots of variety. Staff most accommodating. Nice pools, great beach club, nice to see Mexican families having lots of fun. This is not a bar scene, but  place to relax. Bacocho Beach below is quietest one around."
40,"Not fancy but clean, polite hard working staff, simple menu, good bartenders and drinks, free wifi, amazing beach, very quiet, very simple, very outdated, no balconies. Love the sound of the pounding surf,baby turtle release daily at 5pm down the beach for 500 pesos, great to look at not safe for swimming, very very hot sand, great palapas, not for people with walking disabilities, good for families, teens would be bored. No entertainment. Drink bottled water, take the taxi to town or the market, very safe and only 250 to 300 pesos .From the simple airport in Huatulco a 2 hour van ride very comfortable with air conditioning, very interesting drive seeing the sights of Authentic Mexico.Had an incredible boat ride seeing the beaches and even a giant turtle Beautiful sunsets."
40,"The beach is the best we've visited so far in Mexico. Great for long walks next to the Pacific rollers crashing on the sand. No hotels line the beach, just a turtle nursery. There are 108 steps to walk down from the hotel to the beach, or ask for the hotel shuttle bus. We walked, it was fine. Breakfast and dinner are served in the hotel, lunch and snacks at the beach. The food is great, the drinks are awful. Cheap sugary syrup mixers for cocktails, weak beer, slow service. Why they can't use real fruit in cocktails I don't know. Room 220 had a fantastic view along the beach, but no balcony. The giant bed was good and there was a flat screen TV with HDMI input. Rooms are typical 3 star Mexican but very clean. Our 2 week vacation went quickly!"
50,"Hi:  I am coming back this year, 2016  I stayed here Feb/2010 for a week with my wife and 2 kids (8,10).   Disclaimer:I am an admitted chronic lover of all things Oaxaca.   Luckily for me Sunwings offers a charter out of Toronto to Posada Real.   I'll get a few things out of the way;   It is not: a party spot, a club med, or a super ""shined"" resort.    What it offers is: great value, courteous staff, fantastic location, great security, decent food, great beach club, tennis courts and beautiful grounds.   The architecture is 'meh', but it has; good beds, food, drinks, wifi, and facilities.   The hotel manager was always present, and inquired and responded to our needs.   Posada Real is my goto for an ""all inclusive when you hate all inclusive's"".   It feels like an ""a la carte"""
40,"We bought this property on a rather dramatic sell off with less than 3 weeks before departure.  To be absolutely clear we were attracted to this resort because of it being a traditional Mexican style place rather than a mega resort like a RIU.  We arrived, and the shuttle was waiting for us  The trip to the hotel was 1.5 hours (caution winding road- bit tough for the first 30 to 40 minutes). Arrived at resort and the entrance was nice- not awe inspiring but nice.   Staff were absolutely fantastic on checking us in, special shout out to Carlos.  He's your go to guy if you need anything. The resort is many leveled- no elevators to rooms or beach.  If you are at all restricted in walking, this is not the place for you- even reaching the beach shuttle service requires stairs. Rooms"
50,We stayed a little out of town and hired a vesper to get around. Taxis are very cheap and frequent too. The hotels near Turtle Cafe and that strip of restaurants is a really pleasant spot to stay. Too busy in the main centre for me. Good food all along the streets near Turtle cafe. Best beaches are out of the town.  
50,"I was really surprised that all the staff were very friendly and looking after my needs. Since the lobby staff to the housekeeper solved all my requests in minutes. The hotel was very clean, and beds were comfortable.  The first day food was barely just ok, but maybe because we arrived almost at the time they were closing the buffet; the rest of the days food was amazing.  About liquors, I can tell the brands selection they have is much better, by far, than the rest of the all inclusive hotels I ever been.  My congratulations to the management, because this is possible by your leadership and staff attitude."
40,It was our first visit to the Posada Real in Puerto with friends who have stayed at this resort before.  Their recommendation did not disappoint.  Our two week stay  was easy living and healthy.  There are plenty of stairs for a work out each day to and from the beach area (you can have a ride down ride if you prefer) which is nicely set back from the ocean. I liked the privacy that was available during our stay.  We were free to use the pools and restaurants with no crowds and in fact on some occasions  it felt like a private paradise of my own! The dining areas are outside which I enjoy.  There were many days buffets were available with freshly prepared vegetables and fish.  At others you could order from a menu which similar items to the buffets.  A few trips into town for
40,"We've been coming here on and off for fourteen years. We love the outside space...the pool, the grounds, Coco's beach club, the sunsets!  Yes, the rooms are a little small and tired, but very clean. The pool needs lots of retailing and a good scrubbing, but it's huge and NEVER busy. Some days we were the only two people at the pool. The lounge cushions are comfortable too.  We learned NOT to eat here, the food is just ok, and very expensive compared to what you can find within a three peso taxi ride!  We always book the larger room and drinks only.  One can walk down to the Riconada where there are many great restaurants.  We do swim at Bacocho beach, but one does need to be aware of the undertow..just walk farther down the beach and it is calmer, or go to one of many other"
50,"My husband and I stayed here for 5 days and really felt at home. Manuela was super helpful and accommodating, even when we lost our atm card and did not have cash. She helped us figure out different options and was really trusting and patient with us! She also connected us with one of the locals to take us to another spot to surf and that really made the trip great since we had gone there mainly to surf. Will definitely be coming back and with more friends!A great price to stay here and felt SUPER safe. Quiet and relaxing with the pool and hammocks around. Highly Recommend."
50,"This place is run by two travellers, and it shows. Everything you could want is here: big comfy beds, fun decor, an immaculate pool and clean communal kitchen. The only problem is that you won't want to leave. We stayed an extra two weeks - but I might come back an move in if Manuela and René want to rent out a room forever. Plenty of restaurants walking distance, beaches across the road and a shaded pool to lounge by for hours. I can't wait to come back!"
50,"If you are looking for an all-inclusive luxury hotel with room service and drinks brought to you at the pool, find someplace else to stay. But if you want an authentic experience at the beach, this is the perfect place to find it. This place has everything you need: Just a few steps from the beach and restaurants, with a jungle bird paradise over your head and a lovely pool for lounging anytime you feel like it. The hotel clientele is friendly and interesting, and the communal kitchen brings everyone together."
50,"Wonderful homey place - very clean, the owner manuella is super helpful.  Great value compared to other places on zicatela. Beautiful garden and pool.  3 friendly cats. Shared kitchen and fridge.  Will stay here again next trip to Puerto"
40,"Spent 10 glorious days here, the owners were wonderful and informative. The property is basic but beautiful and we felt very secure. The location on the Zicatela is really good. Lot's to do, easy to get around from this location. Wonderful pool, impeccably clean throughout."
40,"Thoroughly enjoyed this small hotel (only about 8 rooms), right on the surf beach road in Puerto Escondido.  Very close to everything, owners assist with choosing great restaurants.  A gorgeous walk down the beach takes you everywhere.  Taxis are great, only $30 pesos to go into town or shops etc.  Got to Manzanillo beach for $40 pesos, but found out we could walk, so we walked home to the hotel."
50,"We were welcomed warmly by the English speaking owners. The extra-large bed was super comfortable, the room nicely decorated and the bathroom properly functional. It was so good we extended our stay to a week (from 3 days). It is not actually on the beach - just off the beach road up an alleyway, which was quieter and still just a minute to the beach. It was my birthday while we were there and the owners gave me a lovely flower arrangement as a surprise! If you can get in and you want a mid-range hotel, see if you can get in - there are only 8 rooms though!"
50,"Perfect place if you want to avoid staying at a big hotel. Manuela and Rene are great hosts. A nice set up with a communal kitchen, shaded areas to escape the blistering heat, and an immaculately clean pool. Rooms are big and clean with a back patio for hanging your wet clothes. They even have a stocked fridge with water, iced teas and beer that runs on the honour system. Many more great features that you will just have to find out about by booking your stay. Can hardly wait to stay there again!"
50,"Manuela was a wonderful host and we could tell that she took pride in running a nice place. She took time to give us directions and tips on where to go.  My daughter and I loved the location; easy walking to the beach, convenience stores, dozens of restaurants and shops. The surf was big and we rented boogie boards less than a block from the hotel for 100 pesos a day ($6 US)  We went snorkeling one day and based on reading reviews before our trip, I thought the snorkeling was under-rated we had a great time and saw lots of different fish. The water in Puerto Escondido is quite warm, which added to the enjoyment. The only problem we had was that without A/C we had the windows open, with the fans the temperature was nice, however, the noise from the night club music and some dogs"
50,"We stayed at Hotelito Swiss Oasis for two weeks and it was a perfect choice for us.  Swiss Oasis is located approximately 50m from El Morro, the frontage road, for Zicaleta Beach - approximately 4 minutes to walk to the water's edge.  The accommodation is simple, well finished, clean airy and comfortable.  Daily maid service with linen changes every three days.  The owners have placed their stamp on the Hotel with lush and extensive landscaping and the experience of their European, cosmopolitan travelling background. There are eight rooms with a shared community kitchen that provide a private holiday experience.  There are two levels of accommodation, four rooms on each level.  All beds were (we believe) king size and very comfortable.  There was no air conditioning and in our"
50,"If you are looking for a place to disconnect and relax this is it. I so loved this hotel- individual bungalows with a small pool on the terrace and views of the ocean- great healthy food, fantastic drinks (don't leave without trying the Piña Colada), narrow but a 50m pool I could swim in the morning, great massage and next to the hotel a fantastic building called Casa Wabi- a very interesting organisation created by the Mexican artist Bosco Sodi with the architect Tadao Ando- that pays for stays from 3 weeks to 3 months to foreign artists to collaborate with local artists-   And the beach you can walk for an hour without crossing one single person- paradise!   A 20min cab drive from the airport so really easy to get there (700 pesos one way) "
40,"Hotel Ines is a unique hotel in that there are a variety of accommodations: apartment sized rooms to comfortable cabanas. The owner is quite cool and not that friendly; the only minus of the whole hotel. The pool is refreshing and enjoyable on a humid day. I enjoyed sitting poolside using the free wireless internet service. Overall, this is a special, unique charming little hotel and would go back.   Just ignore the unfriendly owner."
50,"Atmosphere: So calm and beautiful here, and like the others have said, thoughtfully designed, and clean. I can't recommend it enough for a quiet getaway. We went during the week so there weren't that many guests, but it's possible that it becomes a party place on the weekends (can anyone else verify?). I WAS a bit disappointed that we couldn't swim in the ocean (this was in March). Still, the lap pool was great, as was our backyard pool, and walking by the beach.  Food: Agree that the food was delicious, especially breakfast (less so dinner, unfortunately). The service was a bit slow (super friendly and helpful, though) — but it's not like we had anyplace to be, so it was just part of being on “beach time” for us.   Service: The overall service is not what you’d get at a top"
30,"Slow and inconsistent service at the pool and restaurant. Food was very good. Massage menu is pointless as they just do whatever they want-- which is quite rough and painful (pass on that for next time). Beautiful location. Quiet. Generally relaxing. Too many other (better) hotel options, so my wife and I won't return."
40,"The design and service were great as usual from this Habita group. The resort is in a remote setting where one can easily relax in the extreme comfort of the resort and its amenities.  Food was generally good. The pool overlooking the ocean is wonderful and so big that you can actually lap swim if you want exercise.   The adjacent Tadao Ando designed art foundation made for a nice afternoon trip.  But: Surprised that after seeking such a remote location the palapas are too close to each other to ensure full privacy .  The tradeoff chosen, more rooms and revenue,  versus greater guest privacy was a let down. If you want the most privacy then your only choice is the palapa furthest out.   Despite being a Habita guest many times, that was not offered to me.  On our fourth day of"
50,"This place is so well done. Isolation, design, and tranquility at its best. Each hut is identical so there's no jockeying for the best room. Just book your flight and go. It's so worth it.   Fanuel was especially helpful in arranging excursions and transportation. We'll definitely be back."
50,"This place is a true paradise.  I can't express how well designed this hotel is without being over the top.  It has clean lines, vibrant colors and minimalist vibe.  Food is amazing here and so is their house mezcal!  Would love to come back!"
40,"This is beautiful and hip property right on the beach in the middle of nowhere.  It stands surrounded by an exquisite beach, Mexican farmland and natural scrublands.  The geographic location facing south allows you to view both the sunrise and sunset over the water.  The individual huts are rustic chic, very comfortable and private. Each thatched cottage has its own private plunge pool, chaise lounges, hammock, and covered bench on the beach.  The bedroom is large and the bathroom roomy as well.  The common area includes a fifty meter lap/infinity pool with a bar leading to the beach that has chaise lounges, umbrellas, and palapas.  Also there is a spa with a sauna and jacuzzi(which we never saw anyone using).  The open air dining room is beautifully designed.  The food is nice,"
50,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Escondido for a weekend in December. We had an amazing experience overall.  The hotel is located on a secluded beach 30 minutes away from the Puerto Escondido airport and town. There are no other hotels on that beach and there is pretty much nothing else around except for Casa Wabi, an organization that brings international artists to interact with the local communities.  The hotel has only around 15 bungalows all of them on the beach and with their own small swimming pool. The rooms are very comfortable and blend perfectly with the beach and atmosphere. They also provide a lot of privacy.  The rest of the amenities of the hotel are also very nice. There is a 50m swimming pool right in front of the ocean with a bar and restaurant.   We had all of"
50,"My review isn't going to capture the beauty, relaxation, and impeccable customer service that we experienced during our stay at Hotel Escondido. After careful consideration, my wife and I chose Hotel Escondido as the destination for our honeymoon and I doubt we could have made a better choice. They offer round trip airport transportation for 1400 pesos (in November 2016) that was prompt, friendly and professional. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly and offered infused ice water while we completed our check-in and then guided to our private palapa or cabin. The palapa itself was immaculately clean and well decorated and provisioned. Although we did not make use of it, the minibar was very reasonably priced. There is a ceiling fan and small air-conditioning unit above the bed,"
50,"What an amazing place!  While not easy to get to from the east coast (we did 2 nights in Mexico city, then quick flight to Puerto Escondido, then rented a car) SO WORTH THE TRIP! We always look for off the beaten path (but nice….) type of places, and this fits the bill.  As you drive up you're on a mile long stretch of dirt road and feels like you're on a desert ranch - cows grazing, cactus everywhere - then you reach the small modern hotel and WOW - the ocean….right there.   All rooms are the same, agree with everyone else, if you want MORE privacy (although you get privacy here everywhere….) ask for palapas toward the end (1 or 16). The breeze, weather, my god, never felt anything so perfect.  Need rental car to go anywhere, Zicatela is very cool little walkable town (40 min"
30,"The location on Zicatela beach is excellent, close to restaurants and bars.  We were 4 people in 4 beds and we had a decent sized room and balcony. For a mid-range hotel it's OK, OK pool, OK rooms but I certainly wouldn't rave about it.  The hotel management is German and very cool and distant, don't expect a friendly welcome.  If I come back I'll look at staying someplace else."
40,"Perfect location in Puerto, chilled out atmosphere and great configuration of apartments and rooms arranged around the pool but right across the road from the beach.  We loved our stay here."
40,"After traveling for 15 hours though winding valleys of southern Mexico, we wer greeted with darkness as we entered the small coastal town of P.E. This did little to dampen our enthusiasm as the street lights glistened in the dark night sky.We arrived at the main bus station and after collecting our bags we headed off to find a taxi, only to be told by a friendly local that the taxi's only stopped on the othe side of the street, but with a quick eye we hailed a taxi and headed down to Hotel Beach Ines, which was recommended by the owners of the last hostel we had stayed at in Oaxaca. Peak season had just ended when we arrived, so we had a choice as to where we could stay and chose a back room called Coco which was rustic & completely comfortable.The only issue we did have was"
40,"After spending the last 5 days at Hotel Ines, I would recommend it to anyone spending time in Puerto Escondido.  Clean rooms, good staff, centrally located, and reasonably priced.  Just cross the street and you're on the beach.  Good resturant. This was my first time in P.E. and found the hotel on this website. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for nice, clean place to stay"
50,"i was there with my kid oliver. i have to say ines and her father(don pedro) doing a good job. you feel like at home, and that is what is hard to find. i am myself in that buisness for a lot of years in mexico. will be back this year in may in puerto escondido. hope hotel ines have a room avaible saludos mike de puerto vallarta"
40,"Ines and staff are wonderful people. The room was right in front of Puerto's middle surfng spot with a vew of the far bar. Clean, safe, good food and right there where it all happens. We left our boards outside our room and nothing was stolen. Nice pool. Thanks to all the staff that made me feel at home. I'll be back for more. "
50,"I spent 10 days at the Hotel Ines and I totally recommend it. My second floor room had a ceiling fan which kept the room cool despite the 90 degree heat. Although the hotel was full, my room was quiet. The pool and Zicatela beach location is what makes this hotel special. Most of the guests were surfers and I took some surfing lessons. The staff was friendly and helpful, suggesting places to visit, things to do. I was travelling alone, next time I'll bring a friend. "
10,"If your idea of a relaxing holiday is filled with ""interesting"" characters hanging about, and strange goings on, well...and  I don't mean this in a good way. "
20,"I was a walk in.  I simply rolled up at the Beach Hotel Ines & was granted a great double room on the ground floor at the rear of the hotel complex.  The room had no air conditioning, simply an overhead fan.  This is okay if you can cope with the heat & humidity at night, but if you can't you should ask for a room with air conditioning.    The room was quite comfortable - however the fly-wire screens were not in good condition and as such I had to invest in some heavy duty insect spray to rid the room of mosquitoes.  Dengue fever is a problem in SOME parts of this region - and when I was in the local pharmacy (directly located next to the hotel) there was a surfer guy in there explaining suspicious symptoms to the pharmacist who announced to the poor tourist, matter-of-factly,"
40,"We stayed here for 2 nights.  The rooms was very nicely decorated.  It was almost like visiting relatives staying there as the owner Pablo had lots to chat about and his friends would drop by for breakfast everyday.  He even drove us to the market!!  Breakfast was lovely, and the best wasunlike other hotels/ or B&B, we could have breakfast anytime in the morning.  Great deal for the price! "
40,"This is a lovely little bed and breakfast. Each morning breakfast is prepared (to order) and all the guest can sit together at the same table and get acquainted. Mostly an English speaking group, your fellow guests normally have great information to share. Also a wealth of knowledge, Paul Cleaver occasionally joined us for breakfast. Paul is the owner and a very friendly and wise man.The breakfast menu is only limited by your imagination. You must try the Chili Rellenos! Everything is fresh from the market or Paul's own farm. The rooms are very big. Most are being retiled. Ask for one that has been renovated. They are breathtaking. You have a great view of the beach, yet just far enough away from the main road. This is a very quiet place and not heavily populated. The only"
20,"Tabachin Hotel has a beautiful view, but also a real security problem. When we arrived, we were greeted only by two boys to help with the suitcases. There was no way to secure our valuables, and we could not find the owner anywhere on the premises for the rest of the day or evening to answer our concerns about that problem. During our first night, thieves entered the room through a window while we were sleeping (with a loud air conditioner that masked the noise) and stole essential Identity Documents, along with several thousand dollars worth of valuables/ belongings (some of them irreplaceable), and a significant amount of money. The incident is fully documented in a police report.   End of our ""vacation."" "
40,"We found this place after needing to leave our popular but hot and unair conditioned hotel. This hotel has air conditioning but we never used as our room faced the beach and was cooled by the breezes. This room (the penthouse) was huge with an incredible wrap around balcony/porch affording a panoramic beach view. It was well appointed with interesting artwork, books and a nice bathroom with endless hot water.  The owner is an artist with eccletic tastes. This is reflected in the building and the rooms. Breakfasts are included and are a highpoint of the day- what ever you want- tropical fruit, fresh squeezed juice, yogurt, housemade granola, empanadas, sopes, eggs, enchiladas..

50,"I ended in Vila a bit by accident and while I think I had one of the less charming rooms, on the ground floor right by the pool no view or possibility to open the windows, it was still an overall amazing experience. From the 100 orchids Adelina ( the owner) has, to the lovely breakfast cooked especially for u more or less whenever you wake up, to Adelina having a ""guy"" for just about everything and was able to arrange things for you within seconds, to the evenings hanging out by the bar+pool with a self service, self calculate how many you have had bar. Also minutes away from what I consider the better beach for swimmers in puerto. Puerto is not a place I would necessarily visit again, unless I transform into a surfer, but now I think I have to, because when leaving you feel"
50,"Absolutely amazing place to stay! Everything there is just perfect - food is delicious, really good service, very clean and cosy rooms, good location and fantastic atmosphere.  I spent there really great time with my friends and I will definitely reccomend Villa Lili to everyone."
50,"Villa Lili is a beautiful building with a lovely pool,very comfortable rooms and a tranquil atmosphere  Luis and Adelina made us very welcome and suggested some excellent local restaurants  Breakfast was truly delicious all freshly prepared with typical Mexican specialities All round a great experience I would highly recommend it"
50,"We spent 6 glorious days and nights at Vila Lili - travelling with my husband and adult daughter.   We researched our trip very thoroughly and it is always difficult to choose the perfect place to stay - especially when you don't know the area and what the different beaches offer. Well, we listened to the advice of other reviewers and now know that we made the perfect choice in choosing Vila Lili. Here are just a few of the reasons why:  - ADELINA is one of the best hosts you will find anywhere - she knows and loves Puerto and wants all visitors to feel the same way. This means she can give you the best inside knowledge on where to eat, what to see, where to have a great massage - AND arrange it all for you. On top of that, Adelina is warm and funny and truly kind. Nothing was"
50,"We stayed with our kids (aged 8 and 10) for five nights in January 2014 at Villa Lili. Our lovely experience started with our booking - Luis was very responsive and flexible, and then sent a taxi to collect us when we arrived. Luis, Adelina and all the staff were wonderfully friendly, patient with our woeful Spanish, and looked after us really well. The breakfasts were lovely in the beautiful open air kitchen by the pool - a different Mexican desayuno every day, and simple eggs for the kids, as well as perfect fruit and endless coffee. The swimming pools were lovely, the honestly bar very relaxed (so were the tunes in the evening), and the location - around the corner from the shopping and eating strip of the Rinconada and a few minutes walk from Playa Carazilillo (by far the"
50,I really love staying at Villa Lili. They really know how make you feel at home. Best service ever!!! Delicious breakfast and the best place to meet interesting people. Thanks for a great holiday!!!! Beatiful and compfortable rooms and the pool area ideal to rest and relax. It was a wonderful expetience to share new years eve with Ade and luis and the other guests. The prices...unbelievable!!!!!
50,"I just returned from an absolutely gorgeous honeymoon at Villa Lili.  I can say without hesitation that our stay was perfect.  We were greeted with personal specific accommodations in our room and a show-stopping sunset view from our balcony  The staff, Silvia, Elena, Fransico and Fernando, are all amazing and super nice.  The owners, Adelina and Luis, are at the same time true professionals and as warm a person as you'll meet.  It should tell you something that I know everyone's name - this place is special.  Puerto is the perfect beach destination: delicious food and drinks and plenty to explore.  During our trip we released baby turtles, swam with fully grown turtles, saw sting rays, dolphins and whales, walked the endless Zicatela beach to our favorite waterfront spot La"
50,"After spending a glorious week in Quinta Lilli, I thought I would check out the Villa Lili. It was just as wonderful. All of the beautiful touches were there. The delicious breakfasts served lovingly by Irene, the refreshing pool and the orchid laden palapa bar made me just want to spend my days relaxing poolside. Under the attentive care of Adelina, this place is one of the nicest accommodations in Carizalillo, Puerto Escondido."
50,"Shame on my for not remembering the name of the wonderful woman who cooked us breakfast every day. Mentioning the food standing out first says more about me than Villa Lili though. It's rare to find a place that lets you have a truly relaxing vacation but Adelina and Luis do. Everything from transportation at the airport, your stay there, activities to do, sights to see, other whims you want catered, they can do it all, and they do it with class."
50,"First time in Puerto Escondido and spent 3 nights in Villa Lili.  Villa Lili means great, awesome, perfect, warm, family, and friends.  From the ladies who prepared the great tasting, different everyday breakfast to the owners/managers Adelina and Luis…  I give you 2 thumbs up for keeping Villa Lili a place to remember and to come back for more.  Food – Yummy! Room – Spacious, Open, Fresh, and Clean!  Did I say ocean view? Staff – Wonderful! Pool – Bonus, Especially after swim in the beach. Location – Great strip of restaurants, bar, internet café (with NFL games showing), and Mini marts just around the corner. Close walk to beaches. Owners/Managers – Brilliant!  Best wedding planners ever…  Thank you for your hospitality."
40,"We stayed here a couple of nights.   I loved the fact that it is walking distance from carrizalillo bay. We also enjoyed the breakfast area quite a bit. We bought local coffee and their home made Jamaica mermelada.   We also enjoyed the area. Puerto escpndido as a town is not very pretty. Never the less this is the perfect zone for a visit and stay in Puerto escondido. We enjoyed all the cafes and restaurants that are located a short walking distance from the hotel.  If I had a bad thing to say is that, the bungalows don't have much privacy. They only have mosquito nets and curtains. At night we felt that everybody could hear us.  Other than that, the hotel attended to us personally and the rest of the staff is very helpful ad well.  "
50,"On a recent trip with friends and family, this place was recommended to us a good breakfast spot. We ended up coming here every day! The chilaquiles were delicious and they serve high quality coffee. The grounds are beauty and curated with a very artistic eye. Angelica is a truly lovely person- kind, generous and attentive to her guests. She helped us out with a booking even though we were not staying at her hotel. I highly recommend this place.  La dueña de la casa que aquilemos nos recomendó este sitio para el desayuno. Resulta que comimos aquí por tres dias enseguidos. Los chilaquiles fueron ricos y tenían cafe muy rico. El jarín fue bonito y curado con una vista artistica. Angelica es una person agradable y generosa . Nos ayudó a organizar un viaje aunque no quedemos en su"
50,"After a long trip from Oaxaca, I felt like I entered an oasis the second I entered the grounds.  The owners have clearly put their hearts and souls into this amazing B&B.  Plus it's only a block from the most beautiful beach in Puerto Escondido in one direction and restaurants and stores in the other.  The gardens are even more gorgeous than the pictures, the rooms are extremely well decorated, and the owners and staff couldn't have been more welcoming.  And I almost forgot to mention how much I loved the breakfast!  The whole experience was like staying with extremely welcoming family members.  The only downside to my time was that it was super hot and humid in August in Puerto Escondido but that was obviously no fault of the owners.  If I return, it will definitely be in the"
50,"lovely few days spent in puerto escondido. this was the perfect base if you want to be near carizalillo beach. very reasonable, comfortable, a bit funky. we too were upgraded to the penthouse suite. Manfred was fantastic, welcoming us early, getting up early to help us find a taxi when we left, sharing with me his motion sickness homeopathic pills (if you need these ask for mareo tabs at any naturalist/homeopathic store in major cities in mexico [not Puerto Escondido] or stock up before leaving. work v well). Manfred booked tours for us, and suggested places to eat, including a small restaurant a few blocks away which did simple cheap really superb oaxacan food - Nuni. Mozart has a gorgeous garden where you can have breakfast - v good, and sit and relax anytime."
50,"Arriving 3 hours early, not so fresh from our over night bus from San Cristobal our day got a whole lot better when we were immediately upgraded to the penthouse suite. What a gorgeous room complete with terrace, hammock and kitchen outside. We felt extremely spoilt. All the staff at this lovely place were extremely friendly and helpful, they couldn't have been more so. The breakfasts were delicious  with home made jam and bread, delicious coffee and we couldn't get enough of the breakfast burritos! We loved making friends with the parrots Lola and Pancho, they were very happy to just hop onto your arm and shimmy up to your shoulder. The beach was a five minute walk away, great for swimming and snorkelling. We loved the fresh coconuts and seafood from the beach bar. Whilst here"
50,"After a 33 hour flight/stop overs we were warmly welcomed and shown our room ahead of check in. Greatly appreciated thank you Manfred. Our original 3 night stay became a 6 night with our changing family mix accomodated no problem. The rooms with vibrant colours and art works; and garden and sculptures create a real little piece of paradise. And the breakfast, setting and fruit salad sublime. Add in the wifi for those agonising flight bookings and it couldnt have been better. There are very good cafes nearby including italian with home made pasta - the ravioli with brocolli sauce was 10/10.Visited Zipolte a couple of times - much more touristy so pleased to be in Rinconada!! Manfred arranged a special trip to see the turtles aying their eggs - 17kms of turtles just everywhere. A"
30,At least that was what the lady who received us told us as we met her. The place is located nearby carrizalillo beach and several restaurants.  The room was nice and decorated with art. The only bad thing was the service or should I say the lack of it. As we never saw anyone from staff until we left. It was supposed to have a continental breakfast but nobody told us the hours or where was it served. 
50,Wonderful space with welcoming hosts Manfred and Angie. Great continental breakfast with excellent coffee. Also has other delicious options to purchase for breakfast. Lola their parrot is a character! Staff here are exceptional and really do an great job making it the gem it is. Rooms were clean and decorated with charm. Close walk to beautiful Carrizalillo beach. Can't wait to return!
50,"We just returned from a fabulous week at Villa Mozart and were so sad to leave.  From the moment we arrived Manfred was welcoming and immediately helped with showing us points of interest on a map and gave us great recommendations for places to check out.  Our room was exactly what we were hoping for - spacious, quiet and comfortable.  There was a ceiling fan that helped cool down the room when we were in it which was a huge help!  The gardens around the hotel were stunning and very well cared for.  If you visit, be sure to make friends with Lola, the parrot.  She was a lot of fun to get to know and is often hanging out in the garden or near the breakfast area!  You could see that Manfred, Angie and their staff take a lot of pride in their business.  Manfred is a huge film buff"
50,"superb garden with hidden treasures of wooden sculptures and art pieces.  We lived in the bungalow for three weeks and found it a lovely retreat from the heat of the beach.  Walking the steps to Carrizalillo was good exercise, but we also enjoyed walking or taking a cheap taxi to the beach club on Bacocho Beach -- Manfred gave us a pass to use this any time we wanted.  Manfred and Angie went out of their way to make our stay easy and enjoyable.  We loved talking to Manfred about movies; he's a true film buff and shows great movies in the garden every week.  The hotel is close to first rate restaurants; we worked our way along the Rinconada strip testing them out one after the other.  You can be lazy and have a beautiful place to relax, or go on trips every day.  We took a"
50,"Spent just over a week here. Enjoyed the scenic grounds and relaxing by the pool. Excellent food at the in house cafe. Room was spacious and clean, with a small outdoor patio. Felt like guests in a home rather than a hotel. "
50,"We felt comfortable from day 1. The owners have a get together once a week in the winter and you get to meet people from all over the globe and make lasting friendships. Rooms are very quaint and comfortable and very clean ! The staff in the kitchen prepare awesome breakfasts and lunches. The grounds are meticulously kept, the staff and owners are always nearby should you need anything from transportation to or from the airport to information on local shopping or which beach would be best for swimming ,snorkelling , surfing or just laying around. Restaurants are numerous and varied  from just around the corner to a ten minute cab ride to town.there is a night watchman and the whole compound is surrounded by a secure wall.The beach is a short walk, however swimming is a little"
40,"The property was lovely with plenty of outdoor space for relaxing.  DELICIOUS home cooked meals available for breakfast and lunch every day, and super friendly staff from the front desk to the kitchen.  The wifi was a little unreliable at times, and being on a working holiday it was a little frustrating. The closest place to sit with our computers for the day was at Zicatela. BUT aside from that we were happy. A short walk to loads of nice beachside restaurants."
50,I can't say enough about this place. We have a Suite which is one block from the water and about 5 blocks from these hippie type Bohemian restaurants. We opted for the Thai restaurant last night and the food was incredible. We were able to walk to town on the beach yesterday which was maybe 20 minutes long but nice walk. The taxi home is 40 pesos which is a little more than $2. We enjoyed the garden patio in the swimming pool last night in this morning we are sitting out in the patio drinking our coffee. If walking is not your thing the staff here will call you a taxi which again only cost $2 to town.
50,"The staff and owners were all really helpful, accommodating and friendly.  Went out of their way for their guests and the grounds are beautiful and super good location to the beach and lapunta break.  Definitely highly recommended "
50,"My partner and I stayed a week in casamar and we were really happy with it. The staff were very helpful with anything we needed to organize, the rooms were really nice it was perfect for relaxing by the pool and not a long walk to resturants beach etc. Great value for money we would definitely come back here, my partner also enjoyed the free yoga that was included. Highly recommend!!"
50,"My daughter and I spent four nights in this oasis of calm and beauty. Our suite had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable, the room was spacious and very clean. The garden was beautifully kept and the hammocks were a perfect way to end the day with a cold beer. The hotel staff were absolutely delightful and extremely helpful. Anything we needed help with or needed booking they were always on hand to give advice.  If I was ever to come back to Puerto Escondido again I would definitely stay here again.l"
50,"Casamar is the perfect place to be in Puerto Escondido. You'll find a beautiful setting with very individual apartments - fully equipped, a fresh-water pool, hammocks to relax in the shadow of the trees, friendly and hospitable owners and staff members and just everything you need to make your stay pleasant. The beach is just a very short walk away."
50,"We stayed at Casamar Suites for a month this Feb.2017....the title says it all. The staff, the accomdation, the fabulous garden and pool area, location of one minute to the beach (you can hear the surf pounding at night), walking distance to restaurants ( La Punta etc), nearby shopping for groceries and fruits and veggies make this hotel a perfect location. The accomdations  are super clean and bright with lively Mexican themed decorations. The garden makes you feel like you are in an oasis, the fresh water pool is a delight to slip into on a hot day. The staff from the admin (Eduardo, Alejandro) to Francesca the cook, Sylvester the gardener to Edith the singing housekeeper are all so helpful and friendly...I felt like I was leaving friends.If you want to head into PE it is a"
50,"My family of four (two adults, one 3 year old and one baby) stayed for nearly a week at Casamar Suites and we were very satisfied. The staff are all very friendly, as are the other guests. For those curious, the vast majority of the guests were Canadian snowbirds. Many of them return year after year and stay for weeks at a time.  The room was well appointed with everything we needed. It was clean (cleaned daily) and comfortable. We did not use the air conditioning but perhaps we should have. In our particular suite, there was an air conditioning unit in only one of the two bedrooms. There are noisy dogs and roosters around so bring ear plugs if you are sensitive to that!  The restaurant served very affordable and delicious food. We were always satisfied.   The grounds are very"
50,"My wife and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary and the reviews were spot on. The service from Adelina and Magda was exceptional, so welcoming and friendly with tips of what to do and where to eat. The breakfast is certainly a highlight, it's a relaxing environment, it's fresh and it's cooked right in front of you with different Mexican dishes everyday. The beach is close by too, about a 5min walk, but if you prefer it's lovely to lie by the pool and read a book. One thing I would mention is you are about 15-20mins walk to the main part of town, so we found having a car was ideal as we walked to the beach nearby at times and then headed into town or Zicatela with the car. But if you don't have a car, there is a bunch of restaurants a street back from the hotel. All in all"
50,"What a gem! Really cute, cozy and clean. Great swimming pool. Magda cooks amazing breakfasts. The owner, Adelina, is super knowledgeable, helpful and very entertaining! We loved Quinta Lili, it felt like our home in Oaxaca!"
50,"We were so happy to find Quinta Lili — even working with Luis & Adelina before the visit, we knew we were on the right track — no question was too small and they were always willing to listen to our concerns.  My wife and I traveled to Puerto with our son, his wife, and our 6 year-old grandson. It was incredible all the little things that Adelina thought of including setting our grandson up with a playmate from their Villa Lili not far from Quinta Lili. We were also invited to a Christmas Piñata party that she put together for the children.   The visit was marvelous in every way. Adelina looked out for us, helping with rental cars, tours, laundry, grocery stores, coffee shops, and the best restaurants.  We were never disappointed & she was always there to double check on"
50,"We were lucky enough to stay in Quinta Lily in early January. We had been traveling for 4 weeks previously and this was the perfect way to relax and unwind at the end of our honeymoon.The hotel itself is extremely clean and comfortable. You have the option of a freshly cooked, local breakfast everyday which we really enjoyed. Adelina was the perfect host and organised some AMAZING day trips for us. We were lucky enough to release some baby turtles while watching the sunset on the beach. We also had a day of game fishing and swimming with the wild dolphins. There were literally hundreds of dolphins flipping and playing by the boat - truly magical. We stayed at the hotel as a couple, but there was a family staying at the same time as us that were accommodated just as well as we"
30,"We had expected Quinta Lili to be special, based on the reviews.  Our rooms were (3 different ones) were funky , to say the least…..There was no hot water at the bathroom sink,  the hot tub in the master suite barely worked, everything is very old, and the stairs going up to our ""special"" room two flights up had no handrail.  There were stairs or steps everywhere.  I had to tell my friends to keep reminding me, so I wouldn't trip.  The special terrace for the master suite is only two chaises under the palapa roof at a loft level.  Not like for having friends share space with you.  Probably the worst part is that it is not near the beach.  To get to the beach, you must hike over dusty fields in a little path for a while, then down some 170 steps!!!!!, then you are on the beach. "
40,"Quinta Lili has so much going for it. Adelina was the perfect host, and we would see her every morning. Breakfast was freshly prepared every day by Magda. I am not the biggest breakfast eater, and so would prefer to have eggs rather than what was on offer, and Magda would oblige.   It was brilliant to also be given towels that could be taken on the beach, which is only 5 mins walk away, and I think the best beach I have ever been to. Also a good selection of eateries nearby.  Quinta Lili felt like a home away from home, and was very chilled (operates a honour bar - take what you'd like from the fridge and write it down in book provided and pay up at end of holiday).   The showers were good and there was hot water. WIFI was also good (you'd be surprised how many places it"
50,"We had the most amazing time staying at Quinta Lili. From the moment we arrived, Adelina was the perfect host. From the most delicious Mexican breakfasts (something different every day!), to the restaurant and activities advice to the fun and friendly chats at the breakfast bar we were made to feel right at home.   The location was perfect, right near the most beautiful beach in a quiet area but only 5 mins drive from the busier beach and bars/restaurants of Zicatela.   The facilities of the Villa were also perfect, rooms were a nice size, airy and clean and the pool and relaxation areas gave everything a very homely feel.   Our biggest problem now is withdrawal symptoms and working out when we can go back!!!  Rhys, Dela, Andy and Katie"
40,"Adelina was a fantastic host, went out of her way for us. The hotel is charming and very quiet. The pool wasn't that great for swimming but the beach was not too far away and Adelina recommended some fantastic hotels nearby."
50,"Quinta Lili, and the owners and staff made for such a wonderful stay in Puerto Escondido. The location was perfect too! Being able to walk to the most relaxing beaches in the area and to dinner each night was perfect.  The folks at Quinta Lili went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.   We would look forward to returning and hopefully staying longer next time (we stayed 4 nights) and maybe book the entire place - it is wonderful to stay as a couple and would be fun as well to stay with a larger group."
50,"We stayed in Quinta Lili for 8 nights in November and it was excellent in every aspect. At very short notice  (the morning of arrival) we asked them if the could prepare something special for a couple in our group who's wedding anniversary it was, upon arrival we found their room lined with petals and a bottle of Champagne on ice. From that moment onwards, everything about Quinta Lili and the people who work there was excellent. Magda and Adelina were the best hosts... the insightful information on what tours to do and places to see, to the advice on where to eat, bringing in a BBQ to Quinta Lili especially for us at shirt notice, the delicious homemade breakfast, airport transfers.... the list is endless. Was without doubt thr most enjoyable stay of our three week trip in"
50,"We (my boyfriend and I) had high expectations from having read the other reviews here on Tripadvisor, but they were all correct - this is the perfect place for either learning to surf or improving your level of surfing and at the same time getting to chill out at the beautiful house a stone's throw away from the beach La Punta. The house includes great details like hammocks in the garden and a fully equipped outdoor kitchen. David is the best host you could ask for; we had a few complications with the house appliances, but he made sure to get it fixed right away, and we could tell he wanted to make sure our stay was as good as possible. This goes for the surf lessons as well: David and the other instructor Óscar were so patient and enthusiastic with us, eager to push us and"
50,"The other reviews are spot on.  PE Surf House is a true gem.  A quiet place just a few steps from beautiful La Punta (and its awesome and fun point break).  The rooms are comfortable and super clean, and David and Swantje are extremely friendly and helpful hosts. I've stayed here twice this summer (while living in Oaxaca) and look forward to more weekend trips to the PE Surf House."
50,"If you like a home like place to stay, with good vibes and with a great surf spirit, this is the place! You always meet people, make friends, the rooms are very clean and it´s a place that is not noisy at all! I love it! highly recommend it!"
50,"We stayed in the Surf House for a long weekend and were super impressed by the facilities, surf boards and all.  David is a great surf instructor as well!   The surf house is walking distance to a lot of neat little restaurants and bars, walking distance to La Punta (if you're a good surfer) and easily accessible to other beaches by taxi. The rooms are nice, clean and functional. Highly recommended."
50,"we had a great time staying for a week in the Puerto Surf house, house was i a great location was clean and the board hire and lessons were fantastic. it was a very relaxed atmosphere and the staff were great particularly during the surfing lessons. there is every chance i will be back to pureto escondido and i dont think i would even consider staying anywhere else."
40,"its not often you find just what your after. but i got pretty close in escondido, and staying at the puerto surf house with the friendly company of david and his friends made the difference. the room very nice, close to the la punta cafes and waves, but off the main strip. will definitely be returning here.  no wifi, but the wifi at cafe ole is good and they do great smoothies and food"
50,"Puerto Surf is a very cool place to learn to surf. David is a great teacher, always positive, patient and calm and the house is beautiful, clean and super close to the beach. La Punta is very nice as well, more quiet then Zicatela beach but with some nice coffee bars and restaurants. I definitely recommend this place :)"
50,"I had the best time staying at Puerto Surf, The house is cool, it has a friendly vibe that connects all of the guests and is located in the most amazing zone in Puerto Escondido ""La Punta"". The host and surf instructor David Salinas along with Oscar really know how to catch the best waves and teach anyone to surf on a safe way.  This place is just perfect to chill, surf, have fun and meet amazing people!"
50,"A calm place to relax while learning to surf with David Salinas, a great instructor with much patience to both the waves and his students. La Punta as an area is very calm, just go with it and get in to the ""La Punta style"" as we came to call it."
50,"I've had a great time surfing with Puerto Surf and staying at their beach house.   It is calm and a very friendly place. At the first try I managed to stay on the board, and later watching other surf school instructors - their student's did not ;) Haha. David, Jesús and Oscar are three very reliable and experienced monitors who know how to read the waves. And they all do a little extra then just be surfing instructors - they take the time to hang out, like eating breakfast together, having bbq, or taking small trips, going to bars.. so they become more like friends. I do already miss Puerto and the relaxed atmosphere there. I took the 5 days package but I could easily had stayed for 5 days more. Time passes by really quickly. I'm definitely  going to surf more in the future!"
50,"this time we came as a family of four and rented the apartment Holanda.  Everything was clean and in good working condition, as expected.  While this hotel is surely not the cheapest offer around the value for the money is good.  And the direct access to the Carrizalillo beach is just unbeatable.  We will return."
50,"It really is paradise.   This was our second time at Carrizallo, we stayed in room Terraza the first time which was great; this time we stayed in room Colorada which was even bigger and more comfortable.   We were curious to see how things had changed after 7 years when we last visited and we were really pleased to see that the hotel is better kept, the food at the Restaurant is much better and the staircase that gives access to the beach is new.    The whole complex has a really peaceful, relaxed vibe. This is a hotel you come to to relax and enjoy the beach, the restaurant, the views and the guest swimming pool.   Other activities available at the Carrizalillo beach include: surf lessons, turtle watching & sport fishing (which you will get offered by the locals as soon as you"
50,"We visited Puerto Escondido, Mx with friends for some much needed R&R. We stayed at Villas Carrizalillo, a beautiful boutique hotel overlooking the best and most beautiful beach in Puerto (pic is right below our room). This beach is well worth the stair climb to get there, perfect for swimming, surfing, etc, or just relaxing with beer, apps & friends."
50,"A very sweet spot. A cool little hotel, villa style.  Rooms are very spacious and most of them are in Villas, of 2/3 rooms with a little kitchen, terrace.  It overlooks right into Carrizalillos bay. There is a private stairway down to the beach.  The food is very very good. The restaurant has an incredible view.  The location is pretty good if you have a car. Its 10 minutes from los adoquines area and zicatela area.  Unless if you want to be right infront of the wave at zicatela this is a great place to be.  The price is pretty fair.  "
50,"was reluctant when she wanted to go to puerto escondido.  We have a six month old and we wanted a simple, easy, vacation with our daughter. We arrived Monday left Friday.  The place is 5 minutes from the airport (don't her anything as there are only two flights a day) We ate every meal but one in their restaurant Espadin that was directly upstairs from our room.  we got married in Oaxaca, I have been all over, and this hotel and restaurant was perfect for our family.  It was quite, with a spectacular view of the pacific, we got messages in our room every day for less than 30 US dollars, over the five days I literally tried almost everything on the menu and i was constantly blown away.  (side note.  I needed a microwave to sanitize the bottles for our baby.   The restaurant did"
50,"This was my first time in Mexico. This place is worth every penny. The staff at the Villa at the bar and at the restaurant were wonderful and did their best to accommodate every need. The Villa is secured and locked at night as well as a night Watchman that walks the grounds. Whichever Villa you stay at you are just steps From the beautiful ocean view. The food and drinks are great. You really cannot go wrong here. I am counting the days until I can go back. The only drawback is that this location is difficult to get to, but well worth it once you get there!"
50,"We are a couple in our early 60's, and this is one of the best places we've stayed on a beach in Mexico.  The accommodations are generous in size, and comfortable.  There's a wonderful restaurant on site that is dreamy for breakfast and delicious for dinner.  We really loved our room called Puebla, with it's small veranda, and spectacular view of the exquisite emerald green beach below.  The beach is perfect for swimming, the water is warm, the days went by much too fast.  We'll return."
40,"We stayed two nights here, it was a bit pricey but a nice change to go from rustic to a bit more comfort. Great bar/restaurant with fantastic sunsets and great food. Loved the beach, bit of a walk down (and up again!) but beautiful sea for swimming."
40,"This hotel is located in a quiet bay with fantastic panoramic views. The rooms are large and very good, the restaurant cooks fantastic food and everything is clean.  The beach is fantastic, just take the stairs down and you're in paradise.  The only down side is that this hotel is a bit far from the restaurants and the touristic part of Puerto Escondido. But hey, the taxis are almost for free!"
50,"Just back from a 10 day stay with our family of 6 adults and 3 children....we could not have been more pleased with the location, the friendly and attentive staff, and the accommodations.  In addition, the Espadin restaurant onsite was a convenient and enjoyable option for local cuisine with lovely staff and a spectacular view over the ocean..our grateful thanks to the Villas Carrizalillo and Espadin teams, and special thanks to Patricio for his warm welcome and hospitality....highly recommended, and we will return"
40,"I just recently drove from huatulco to check out vivo resorts..the signage to find the place was so poor we drove around for 30 minutes trying to locate the resort..spent 20 minutes driving on a dirt road and finally found the complex..beautiful design..cutos to the owners and marketing team that have been  able to sell these condos n villas in such a remote location..you need a car, only two restaurants on site than you must endure the dirt road for 20 minutes to get out of resort than another 20 minutes to town to dine or shop..don’t think it’s for me ..also pricing..looked at 1000sq.ft unit with 200 sq.ft terrace ground floor..$380,000 US. that’s almost $400per foot. US    than about $1000 a month canadian for maintenance ..    Toronto March 2019"
40,"Recently my husband and I visited Vivo with friends who are owners at the resort. We were very impressed with the resort, the condos and facilities, as well as the wonderful staff .  Everyone takes great pride in providing the best experience for their guests, and you really feel the sense of community.  Recognizing that this is still a work in progress there are still some things that could use improvement . Specifically the consistency of the  quality of food at both restaurants . We had to send things back three times.. However we also had some wonderful meals there as well. The wings at the thai restaurant are amazing. The burgers and shakes at the clubhouse great.  The entertainment staff, specifically ""Israel Navarette"" absolutely made my trip. His energy and passion "
50,"My wife and two children (ages 19 and 16) stayed at this resort in January.  It was my second visit to the Oaxaca region and first visit to Puerto Escondido for all of us.  This resort is located about 8 miles north of Puerto Escondido or about a 20 minute ride into town by Taxi.  The hotel has two daily roundtrip shuttles (10 am - 4 pm or 12 noon to 6 pm) for a fee.  Individual taxis are plentiful, albeit slightly more expensive.  If you are looking to stay right in downtown Puerto Escondido, this is not the place for you.  If you are looking for a relaxing great little spot, please read on.  The resort is beautiful.   The pools are well maintained and the water temp is spot on.  The beach is quite lovely and perfect for long walks, volleyball or lounging under an umbrella.  "
50,"I cannot recommend it enough. Whether it is for couples looking for romantic getaway or for families traveling together, these place ticks all of the boxes. Great quality / value ratio. Beach is clean. And since it is basically the only property around, it stretches for miles and miles finding nobody but hotel guests... Delightful! We did the turtle freeing experience, which is something I will never forget. I just wish they had an all inclusive plan merely for convenience purposes. Perhaps something to look into  in the future?"
50,"We spent the month of November 2018 and 2017 at Vivo Resorts and Puerto Escondido and love every minute of it.  The miles and miles of beach never cease to amaze me.  The people at the resort (visitors and staff) are friendly and fun and we have met some great people over the years.  We have attended concerts, food festivals, fishing derby's and surfing competitions, numerous beaches and little towns.  We have taken surf lessons - WOW its harder than it looks,  Paddle Boarding, turtle release, whales and dolphins swim right in front of the resort.  We have attended Rotary meetings and volunteered at Orphanages.  This past trip I even took Spanish lessons and learned how to play pickle ball.  I love this place, it is authentic and unspoiled and a very special place in the world. "
50,"This is a ten star, one of a kind resort. The service was absolutely outstanding and the condos are stunning. When you are picked up from the airport by lovely drivers you are given facial towelettes and ice cold drinks of your choice. First steps on to the Vivi property you are served drinks and are welcomed by the staff and others. The food is incredible. Resorts usually have half a pool, but Vivo has three huge pools with pool bars and volley ball nets. One stay will make you want to live there forever!"
50,"This was our third trip to Vivo.  It was our first with the new clubhouse and amenities.  The raw beach on either side of Vivo is a huge draw for us.  The condos are truly first world.  We have never had any problems at all with the water, condo, security, or services.  The new clubhouse is wonderful.  The new gym, kid center, and eating space are well-done, and excellent additions.  A couple of notes:  Vivo is isolated.  It is twenty minutes from town, and 5km on a gravel road.  Commuting to town via taxi or shuttle is a necessity.  This may perturb some.  The destination is well worth it, in our view.  What sets Vivo apart is the staff.  Flor, Ramiro, and Salvador leading the wait staff are serious professionals.  They are extremely attentive and concerned that everything is"
50,"This resort is very quiet, peaceful and the food is outstanding. My family love this place, live like locals and having comfortable amenities. All the rooms are ocean view . The shuttle bus to town are very convenient to go to visit local restaurants, church , grocery stores and gorgeous beaches as well. "
40,"The people and staff are very friendly and helpful. If you like a secluded quiet vacation this is the spot for you. It is really in the middle of nowhere. Lots of walking beaches however, not a swimmable ocean due to the high waves and rip tides. Restaurant and drink prICES were very, very affordable. Hats off to our bartender at the pool Sheyna. A very sweet girl that tried so hard to interact with everyone and provided such good friendly service!!"
50,"The kid's clubs, activities, adult activities and all we did make it superb. Carlos the events manager and all of the staff set the days up perfectly with opt-in activities for all of us and then the kids club in the evenings was the go-to place for the crew while we had some of the best cuisine we have ever had traveling.  We will be back."
50,"Enjoyed our time. Location is superb, close to everything, especially the beaches, but just perfectly ""away"" from everything.  Some of the rooms (just a couple of them) might not be that nice, they are close to restaurant at the same floor. Or what do I know. Luckily the restaurant does not get that noisy, it's more of a romantic restaurant than a party place and it closes early. And the food there, it's just perfect.  It's not the cheapest but definitely affordable, even for a budget traveller. And it's worth it.  We stayded for a week and wouldn't want to leave. If we ever get back to Puerto this is the place to stay. All the best to Paul and Jo-Ann.  Regards,  Aki and Leena"
50,"My son, friend and husband went to visit Puerto Escondido mostly to see the surfers abilities and to enjoy the scenery.  We found Hotel Flor de Maria through 'the Lonely Planet guide' and we already felt that we made a good choice after reaching them for reservations.  This hotel is greatly located, close to the beach and to all other interests, the place is just charming, comfortable, pleasant and also very clean.  Paul, Joanne and all their team are present to make your stay as perfect as possible, by their knowledges of the areas, excellent advices on tours, overall customer services.  On the third floor (top of the hotel), there is a nice pool, patio, bar, 'hamacs', satellite television, and a great view on the beach and ocean.   The perfect place to relax.  You can't miss"
50,"As frequent travellers, it's not often that a location and travel experience exceed our anticipation as much as our stay at Flor de Maria in Puerto Escondido did.   While immersed in the authenticity of the location (no inflatable banana rides, no ""booze cruises"" that defile many resort locations), the Flor de Maria is perfectly situated to be right in the middle of an authentic Mexican experience.  While it's convenient walking distance to the surf beaches one way and the Adoquin the other, it's only about $2 for a cab ride anywhere else.  Hosts Paul and Joann were truly exceptional! Their knowledge of the area and their love for it shows.  While never intruding into our plans they were always quick to offer suggestions that worked well for us - i.e. the lagoon tour north of"
50,"We had a wonderful experience at the Hotel Flor de Maria.  We spent eleven nights in October for our honeymoon.  Although we were there for the slow season and we regret the restaurant was closed (Joann has to have some time off!  Being a chef, I understand completely!) we loved it!  We spent a lot of time on the roof by the pool drinking beer, soaking up the sun and doing absolutely NOTHING, which is exactly what we wanted.  I know I've read several reviews complaining about cold water, but I discovered (after being hit by a 'rogue"" waive in the ocean) that the water in the shower does indeed warm up, but you must be patient.  Highlights were the cliff walk, Gina's walking tour and above all, Paul and Joann themselves.  They were the epitome of hospitality, and the housekeepers"
50,"My boyfriend and I recently spent four wonderful days at Hotel Flor de Maria.  We followed Tip Advisor reviews and were glad we did! Never having traveled to Puerto before, we counted on our gracious hosts Paul & Joanne to  guide us.  They were so helpful with all of our many questions and ""need to knows"".   They were instrumental in providing us knowledgeable guidance that made our stay the best in every way. Our room had two beds, private bath& shower with a safe box and overhead fans.  Drinking water was provided, you just fill up your pitcher from their filtered system.  Our room was always clean as was the entire hotel.  The staff very  pleasant and happy to provided for your needs.  The style is charming colonial with the colorful wall and door paintings literally painted"
40,"I stayed at the Flor de Maria for a week. The rooms were clean and spacious (no TV). The location was excellent, not on a main street with lots of noise, but accessable to all the beaches. I never had a bad meal at the restaurant and the staff was friendly and helpful. The room rate was a little more expensive than what is posted on Trip Advisor. I had a great time. I will be back."
50,"It had always been a dream of ours to spend Christmas with our family in Puerto Escondido. We enjoyed our last stay at the Hotel Flor de Maria so our accommodation selection was a no-brainer.  The food was fabulous, especially the special Christmas turkey dinner that the kitchen prepared. This is one of the best places to eat in PE -- the restaurant was full most evenings.  The rooms were clean and comfortable -- the staff were great! The rooftop deck is a great place to relax, hang out and cool off in the pool.  By the end of our trip, non of our family wanted to go home. In fact, my mother decided to stay on by herself. I think Christmas at the Flor de Maria might have to be a regular event."
50,"Stayed for three weeks. The owners are amazing people. The staff equally so with special mention to marguerita, who when she wasn't making theee best drinks was our in house spanish teacher. The roof top pool and bar is about as relaxed as you could want. Half a block from the best swimming beach with built in fine food you won't do better for the price although we paid more like 60 CAD.not the 35USD noted on Trip Advisor. Still worth by far over  other hotels. Hope to return next winter, Steve and Sue "
50,"Our stay at the Hotel Flor de Maria in Puerto Escondido was absolutely amazing.  If you're looking for a combination of value and comfort, then P. E. and this hotel are definately for you.  The rooms are in great shape, beautifully decorated and well maintained.  The hotel staff was friendly and worked to make sure that our rooms were clean, yet never seemed annoyed if we slept in.  After the first night, the fact that the hotel doesn't have air conditioning didn't matter at all-most places in P.E. don't so you just get used to it (and we're kind of ""americans"" that love their air conditioning!).  The hotel is a short walk to the beach, however, I recommend planting yourself along Zicatela-about 5 more minutes south; the waves are remarkable and the beach is less crowded,"
30,"We stayed at Flor de Maria during the winter of 2006...it was comfortable and staff were friendly.  Convenient to the main swimming beach, the pool and deck were comfortable and relaxing...However, the beds could use more in-depth cleaning...there were bedbugs in the mattress! "
40,"Looks very nice hotel, nice grounds,pool. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The wonderful location. Room in the Mexican style. A little old room. Room in need of repair. Very old towels with holes. Suitable for one night. Poor value for money."
50,"The hotel Paraiso is in a convenient location,  only a  five minute walk to the main beach playa principal.  Beautiful older building with a lot of character and charm.  We stayed in two of the third floor suites which were very roomy and had large balconies with a beautiful view of the bay.  Beds were very comfortable with firm mattress and extra bonus of air conditioning that worked well.  We also enjoyed the restaurant that served simple mexican food at reasonable prices.  We loved the restaurant area which overlooks the pool.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful although Sergio, who is the manager of the hotel,  is the only one that speaks english.  Sergio was terrific:  cheerful and always ready to help out.  He suggested several tour operators in the area and we"
50,We booked online due to good reviews and were not disappointed. Sergio put us in his biggest suite for and provided good and relevant advice. He recommended an excellent fishing and canoeing trip and the whole vibe was friendly and unobtrusive. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again. sergio sorry it's taken so long to post the review but good experiences are worth the wait.
50,"Staff is very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are nice and they have air conditioning.  The hotel has a nice pool.  It is centrally located.  The hotel is within walking distance of the main beach, the large super market, called the Super Che, and one of the main shopping areas.  A cab in Puerto Escondido is only about $2.00 US. The restaurant was not open but there are many places to eat close by."
50,"We arrived at the hotel first thing in the morning to learn we were the only guests that week - and we were therefore lucky enough to be able to check into out top-floor suite straight away.   The room had a large balcony with views over the pretty pool and its gardens as well as the entire length of the famous surfing beach at Puerto Escondido. The beds were comfy and there was a good size fully tiled shower room, and some metal chairs on the balcony.   The accommodation was otherwise quite sparse and more comfy chairs would be nice - but this would probably be a good 3-star in other countries and the experience here exceeded my  expectations - lovely people, wonderful views - hence the 5 stars.   There is good security with  metal gates at the front of the property which are"
50,"This hotel represents the true vibe of what makes Puerto Escondido such a special vacation destination.  We loved its traditional Mexican decor, including the pool and large private balcony with spectacular views.  What makes this hotel stand out is its staff.  All of the reviews are right--Sergio goes out of his way to ensure that his patrons have an enjoyable stay.  I had checked out of the hotel and traveled to Huatulco when I realized I left my passport in my room.  Sergio made arrangements to have it returned to me at my next hotel, where it was promptly delivered free of charge.  If all hotel managers were this nice, traveling would always be enjoyable and free from headaches."
50,"This was our 6th year in Puerto and 5th year at the Hotel Paraiso so I'm sure that speaks for itself.  We will be back there for a month again next year.  Everything is just the way we like it.  The location is perfect, the view is spectacular and Sergio goes beyond our expectations to make us comfortable, safe and happy during our stay.  The staff is all very helpful and keep this beautiful hotel clean and welcoming."
50,"Hotel Paraiso Escondido is exactly what it's name implies, paradise in Puerto Escondido! This gem is more like a quaint hacienda. This was our second time staying there. Sergio, the manager, bent over backwards to make our stay absolutely fantastic. All the staff - Irena, Roberto, & Martin are great. Very personable. Although the staff don't speak English, Sergio is very fluent in English.   This hotel is in a great location, just minutes in walking distance to the beach yet far enough away from the Adoquin where music from bars might extend late into the evening. It is also just down the hill from Super Che, a decent size grocery store where you can stock up on cervezas, food, or miscellaneous items.   The rooms are clean and spacious. The best view of the ocean is from rooms"
50,"Just spent two weeks in Purerto, this hotel is centrally located, beautiful and the staff is amazing. Can't say enough about Sergio. If your in Puerto you have to stay here."
50,We spent 3 nights at Hotel Paraiso. It was really charming. Lots of detail & interesting things to look at. Sergio & the rest of the staff were very friendly & helpful. And we loved the little boy at the restaurant! The pool was great. No problem getting internet service from our room & AC worked great. No complaints-would highly recommend.
50,"Charlotte's Yin Yoga and Maggie's HIIT class on Sundays MADE my time in PE. The pair of them are the perfect balance of yin-yang energies – their classes side by side will leave you feeling COMPLETE.  After our first class, my boyfriend and I promised we would try our best to never miss one while staying in PE. Safe to say, we fell in love with the instructors!  The hotel provides an EXCELLENT backdrop to the high intensity interval training and intense yin stretching. After class you can take a dip in the pool and enjoy some of the complimentary breakfast!"
50,Casa de Olas is absolutely lovely. It's a great mix between relaxation (great workout and yoga classes and the beach around the corner) and the buzz of la Punta.  The team are super nice and give great advice for tours and things to see. Also the kitchen and bar in the evening serve great food en (non alcoholic) drinks.
50,"I can't say enough good things about this place. This was my first time travelling solo, to Mexico and also as a remote worker. I was nervous about travelling by myself, as well as the wifi connection.  Everyone at the hotel was absolutely incredible. The staff are professional, kind, helpful and made my stay at the hotel (which was 3 weeks) so much more special. I ended up staying in the town after and regularly visited the hotel for recommendations, to visit and for some great drinks & workouts.   There are daily workouts which was the best. Since I stayed for an extended period was able to catch the classes by all the trainers. Charlotte is an incredible yoga teacher and person (would highly recommend her yin classes and the Self care Sundays). Margaritas classes were intense"
50,"could not be more happy with my experience at casa de olas. The hotel feels like a little oasis of serenity with a charming pool and lounging area. The staff was always so friendly and warm & the fitness classes were challenging, sweaty and fun. Highly recommend taking Charli’s class for a dreamy vinyasa experience. Cannot wait return!!"
50,"I stayed at casa de olas for about a week, lovely environment with a great pool little gym and loads of yoga and classes. Adomo and Monica behind the bar make the best food and the seriously some of the best cocktails I've had. It's nice because their are several quiet spots like the roof terrace where you can chill and read or you can sit by the bar and listen to some music. Internet could be a bit better but that's a general problem at puerto."
50,"Heading back for the second time because this place is so great. Very sociable, great friendly staff, and amazing yoga by Charlotte! Strongly recommend the yin class and the self care Sundays! Rooms are kept very clean and the communal areas are great.. gym, hammock, pool, day beds!"
50,"Absolutely love this hotel and cannot recommend it enough! The location is perfectly tucked away from the super cute beach town of La Punta and within close walking distance to everything. The hotel also offers bikes that you can use to get around and explore. Everything about the property is well designed with a beautiful pool, bar, hammocks, lounge areas throughout, stunning yoga shalas with the views of the ocean, and an incredible staff that makes you feel at home. The food and drinks are absolutely delicious too! The perfect place for a getaway!"
50,"I would highly recommend staying at Casa de olas boutique hotel - The food was delicious, weather was incredible, hotel was clean, and the service and staff were amazing; the staff remembered my name and favourite drinks and made my stay so special. I felt like family when I left! The hotel feels very cozy and secluded even though you are minutes from the surf beaches, tons of local restaurants and the market. Definitely check out the weekly Salsa night with free lessons! Also the pool and drinks are next level. I had an amazing stay here and hope to be back next year! (Or sooner!)"
50,"Casa De Olas is the perfect place to stay in La Punta. The staff is incredible and goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is what you expect, even when you check out they will still help you if you ask. They have a chef who cooks homemade meals every night with lots of variety. There is a tennis court attached to the property with a wonderful coach Nacho. I've stayed there twice in one month and the recent visit was when COVID-19 started to spread. They never lost their charm and kindness, if anything it was enhanced. Staying here is like staying with family."
50,"Casa de Olas had great reviews online, but I never expected it to feel so welcoming. The rooms and location are great, but I think what sets it apart is definitely the AMAZING staff. We felt welcomed from the moment we arrived, and were warmly taken care of the entire stay. I had heard one could find yoga classes in Puerto Escondido, and I was very pleasantly surprised when I found out Casa de Olas had an in house yoga teacher, Charolette, who offered complimentary classes, which were amazing! There wasn't anything I would change about my stay - definitely looking forward to coming back!"
50,"The hotel is on the older side of things, however, the service good food and great location makes it a perfect place for a retreat.  Reading a book in the beach club sipping a Piña Colada (the best I ever had) and swiming around in the pool is perfect.  I love how the beach is still almost intact and not full of tourist as other beaches in Puerto are."
40,I realy like this hotel becose the service is great all of the staf is very nice . Also you get a free drive to be beautiful beach club . Overal the best stay we had in mexico
50,"I stayed with my wife and my 9 months baby in this hotel for a couple of nights. The hotel has an excelent beach club located a few steps away (transportation service available) with  adult pool including a wet bar and other pool for kids, hammocks in the beach area for a great after-meal nap. The waiters are friendly and willing to serve. Also our breakfast in the main restaurant was good. I recommend the hotel for people who wants to be disconnected from the daily rush..."
30,"We just came back from our stay at the hotel Villa Sol. We must agree with the first reviewer in this review section.  The hotel has two really good points. The Beach Club - A little safari type bus takes you to the near by beach . A beach that is very beautiful, secluded and peaceful. The beach is for hotel guests only and there is also a pool and bar. Very nice Secondly, Puerto Escondido itself. The hotel is a 15 minute taxi ride to the main town.  Ok that's the good...And now the bad. Breakfast is OK, yes, with eggs, juice, and other things.....However we spent our breakfast times trying our best to eat as quickly as possible due to the invasion of wasps, bees and flies that attacked us in the open air dining area! Breakfast food is 'OK' BUT the food on the menu is absolutely"
30,"Hotel has two great assets: its beach club and the friendliness of staff. However the hotel is in a very poor condition, barely being classified as 3 stars, especially at the rates charged during new years´week of over $130 dolars."
50,"Really nice hotel, the everything here is amazing. Just 5 minute to Airport, with a really friendly staff, clean rooms, AC in good conditions. The food was really good. Breakfast is complete with Juice or fruit, including eggs. We are come back home with good impression about Puerto Escondido and of course of this Hotel. It's near from everywhere, Taxis are very cheap to Zicatela, El Adoquin, La Punta, Carrizalillo and Puerto Angelito. The farther beach is just about 10 minutes from this hotel.  This Hotel is OWESOME."
50,"Well I certainly would have to tell you that the first reviewer that said this was a Hotel from Hell was dead wrong. It was a hotel from Heaven.  Things have really changed at this hotel since late 2006 and the management has really done a makeover on the staff, rooms, restaurant and beach club. Attention to detail is now the norm.  Right from the first time we stepped into the lobby we were greeted by two friendly employees and the bellman. They took us over to the front desk where our room key and paperwork were all waiting for us to sign. It was very organized.  Then we were taken to our 2 bedroom apartment with a kitchen and a living room. It had a king bed in one room and two queens in the other. Lots of closet space, make-up area with a lighted mirror and a few end tables."
10,"Where do I begin? This was the single worst experience I, or my wife, have ever had at a hotel. We had paid over $150 USD per night. We knew this was awfully expensive for Mexic, but we accepted it as it was our honeymoonand it was during the Christmas high season.  When we arrived the people behind the desk didn't greet us, but rather brusquely gave us our keys and the security guy took us to our room. When we got to the room it was not what we had ordered and the room was a DUMP.  So we went back to the service desk where after much confusion we were given another room. Although the room was much nicer than the first one, it wasn't great but acceptable. Then we found out the air conditioner wasn't working. As he left, the security/bell person asked if there was a TV in the"
50,A real nice Hotel at the edge of lovely Puerto Escondido. The place is very quite - ideal for people who like to experience nature and families. You can reach the city centre and the airport with a cab just in five minutes. The hotel offers an own beach-club which made me feeling like in paradise. (Or in Hawaii.. ;) The waves - too.) Just incredible. I've been travelled around to many places - but here - at the Hotel Villa Sol - I've met a staff - that treated me like a family member.  Prices are above the average (in the town-centre) - but if you like some comfort and service - you should afford this.
50,"Hotelito Swiss Oasis is right on Zicatela Beach, one of the main strips in Puerto Escondido. The shared courtyard was perfect for relaxing after spending the day in the heat of Puerto. All the facilities were clean, and the owners were so helpful and welcoming! Could not have picked a better spot to enjoy Puerto from!"
50,"We stayed here for two nights in room # 8 and our friends were in room 4. Fabulous bilingual hosts, a perfect sized pool, rooms with big fans and patio doors that opens for a great cross breeze at night. Shady Hammocks for chillin anytime. There is a common kitchen and a fridge stocked with beer and water that you can help yourself to....using the honour system ( big white board) to track and pay. Love the colours and feel of this place, and would, definitely recommend!"
50,"Location is only a half block from the beach, restaurants, shopping. Very quaint, clean and comfortable. No Air but the fans are sufficient. Common kitchen area with the greatest little courtesy honour bar, LOVE IT! The hosts were wonderful. We have always come back to this place when we visit. Highly recommended."
40,"Clean , Basic budget hotel located a short stroll from the beach and shops , Freindly staff . The building is clean and well maintained , has all you really need. The only issue was at times the noise comming from neighbouring businesses was a little loud .The units have no windows and noise travels easily. "
50,"we enjoyed very great , relaxing holiday here . Hotelito Swiss Oasis is perfect located and has a great charm .  we got good tips, and even some surf lessons at super trustworthy surf instructor . We will certainly come again . thanks to Manuela and Rene. "
50,"We spent 4 nights here on our journey to Costa Rica. It is about a block from the beach and main road. Was a lovely place to stay. A lovely pool and beautiful gardens in the courtyard. The rooms were on the small side but comfortable, with a deck. There is a shared kitchen and fridge to put your food in, there is also a beverage cooler stocked with beer water and juice for sale at a reasonable price. We only noticed some noise from the bars on Saturday night but didn't keep us up. Marcella helped us out with suggesting places to eat, shop, spa and even a vet for our dog. The only thing that would have been nice would be air conditioning, however the fans made the nights survivable. Met a lot of expats who have been coming here for 20 years or so and spend the winters down in"
50,"I spent a week in Puerto Escondido and found the destination amazing. Many places to visit and the atmosphere is very relaxed.   The Hotelito was definitely an important part of the experience, very well located, very well managed and the guests very friendly.   Thanks Manuela for a great vacation!"
50,"My friends and I traveled to PE and booked via internet this small hotel. We admit that the word swiss caught out attention. We hoped for swiss hospitality and that s exactely what we received. A small cheap hote that offers more than a small hotel :-) pool, kitchen small amenities (sun creans...). The owner is extremely friendly and knows the town inside out. They have a lot of cats and a dog, all super nice"
50,"I stayed at the hotelito for 3 weeks and really loved it. Very lovely and helpful owners. The rooms are clean and comfy and in the yard you may relax in the hammock or enjoy the pool. There is even a community kitchen. Close to beach, stores, beachclubs, restaurants - everything you might need for your trip!  will definitely be back soon."
40,"Clean, quiet, convinient and only a 3 minute (250 mtrs) walk to a great beach. Even has a book exchange. Would stay again. Recomended a great restaurant and provided helpfull info. Spoke Eng, Spanish, Swiss and German."
50,"This gem of a hotel is made up of a 9 luxurious thatched huts within earshot of the surf, surrounding a small restaurant and bar featuring local dishes and fresh catch. The staff treats guests like family---no request seems too burdensome, room service is prompt and with a smile.  I can't say enough about this find. It's been over 30 years since we had the same in Puerto Vallarta, only to discover it demolished when we returned 20 years later.  This place is in the top 5 the last 100 we have visited."
50,"If you want complete relaxation this is the place to be.  Very few tourists and you have a whole stretch of private beach. Staff is very friendly.  There only 13 huts and each of them are very private and nicely decorated. You have your own dipping pool and private path in the back to get to the beach.  Be sure to get all the snacks and drinks you'd like when you get into town before heading to the hotel. Chips, alcohol and pop. Other than that you won't need anything else. Each room also comes with Bluetooth speakers that you can take to the beach with you."
50,"Excellent location to forget the stress and the city!! For me one of the best choices I've made! The hotel was clean, people were extremely friendly and the food was great!! Definitely I recommend this hotel for couples who want to get away from work, or just a weekend of relaxation! The massages were also pretty good, but the best for me was the accommodation with its own pool!"
50,"The layout of the limited rooms gives a lot of privacy anytime of the day, even you can ask for a couple massage in your patio.  There you have your own hammock and pool.  It is not a ""disconnected"" hotel  so you will never get anxious of not being online, almost all the hotel is covered by wifi, and each room have their own BT wireless speaker so you can have your relaxing playlist with you at the beach huts.  No neighborhood properties so yo have a large lonely beach for your morning runs,  then a 50m pool if triathlon is your thing.  I cant describe the restaurant choices for breakfast, snacks and dinner with out spoiling the surprise. They are perfect and actually very well priced.

50,"Hotel Escondido has Only 18 rooms very comfortable all of them with a pool. Service is excellent offering all the time fresh drinking  water, is the best place for relaxing and enjoying the nature, the sun and the ocean. The restaurant has great food breakfast is excellent. Front desk can arrange for you different excursions, if you want to visit some interesting places around there."
50,"We traveled to Hotel Escondido in March and stayed for one week. From the second we arrived we were blown away. The hotel itself is so secluded and after driving for almost an hour from the airport we were starting to get nervous. Honestly the hotel is really unlike anything in the surrounding area. It almost has a sort of luxury rustic vibe since it’s not your typical “resort” but much more boutique.   The rooms themselves are really quite beautiful in a very minimalistic way. Overall we were pleased with the our room minus a few things. First I HIGHLY recommend asking for a room on either end, further away from the center. We were given room #2 which was actually great since the whole week we were there no one stayed in room #1 ( I think they were doing work on it ). The"
40,"We stayed at Hotel Escondido for 2 nights in December.  It was a last minute booking, but after a few days of more basic accommodations we decided to splurge on a beachfront getaway.  The hotel is in a remote location several miles from Puerto Escondido with several beachfront bungalows all with direct beach access.   Each bungalow feels quite secluded and is clean and spacious with sliding doors opening out onto a private porch (with shade) and plunge pool.  There is also a very large infinity style pool with a bar at the main area for the hotel.    We didn't see anyone swimming in the ocean when we stayed (generally advised against due to currents) but my husband did wade in just for the experience.  As the hotel is far from the other resorts, we pretty much had the whole"
50,"One of the best vacation to relax, enjoy the scenery, rest and be pampered. Great Architecture, Location, food and service.. The beach is great. I saw a great amount of stars on the sky i never thought I would see in my life."
50,"We were looking to get out of Puerto Escondido, we found this place and fell in love! The rooms with your own plunge pool were amazing and so charming. The landscape was beautiful with all of the cacti and mountains in the background. The service was wonderful and food was very creative at dinner. Breakfast and lunch was more traditional. We would highly recommend Hotel Escondido."
50,"You arrive to this hotel after a 10 minute drive down a dirt track through marshes and fields - what awaits you is pure magic! There are only 16 rooms each with their own plunge pool and the most amazing view over the beach. The rooms are in the palapa style but with modern decor and luxury bed linen, the bathroom is lovely too with local toiletries.   The hotel is in the most amazing location and the 50m pool stretches along the beach so even though you can't swim in the sea you are still swimming right on the beach. Your stay is half board including breakfast and inner, the food is lovely with different options every evening, all home cooked and huge portions! Highlights were pork ribs and the seafood soup.   The hotel can organise trips for you and we went on the"
40,"Excellent service! The hotel staff is very friendly, there is a convenient store located in the lobby of the hotel that you can buy a variety of travel items. You can see and hear the beautiful Pacific Ocean from your rooms. The hotel is very clean. "
30,"The Internet/WIFI didn't work on all 4 of our devices after the first usage, 4 days no internet.   The food was okay but VERY ordinary for a vegetarian.  All inclusive drinks close at 10.30pm... And there are no lights in the pool. The hotel is kinda dead boring after dark.  The location on google maps is very wrong  The place is very old and tacky, surprising consiering the cost."
50,"Booked this trip last minute before Christmas break and did not expect much but sun and sand.  Well...pleasant surprise. Hotel is old, glory days were in sixties :). But it has kept the charm of these days...service excellent, food excellent and the picky eaters like my son will be happy with choices.   Beach club "" Cocos""...so far the best beach club i have been into. And I have seen a lot! Service, drinks and beach...just prime !  Well. The rooms. Clean , comfortable with old old bathrooms.  If you expect to find luxury resort Mayan stile this is not for you. If you want to enjoy real Mexican flare, do not hesitate.  Love it and will be back soon."
40,"Visited in January 2014. Loved this place and the town itself. Very safe place to walk, even after dark. You can walk for miles on the beach, although the water is very rough for swimming, but you can watch the surf hit the massive natural rocks on the beach all day. Spectacular sunsets from the beach or from above on the resort grounds. Breakfast and dinner are served in the main restaurant upstairs and lunch is served in the restaurant on the beach. What a great idea. 2 pools, one up and one on the beach. Food was a mixture of Mexican and American. Took a cab ride into town to the local market. Great deals and vendors were not pushy sellers! Only drawback of this hotel is that there is no balcony or terrace. But then, you meet outside the main restaurant and meet plenty of"
40,"This resort is clean, the outdoor space is exceptional (sunsets and pools and private Baccocho Beach), and service is outstanding. Our only disappointment was the size of the room. My husband & I stayed for a week with our 15 year old son. Each room has two double beds (not queens!) or one King. All rooms have windows only, no balconies, which is a shame. So the sq footage of the rooms is tight for 3 adults; probably good for 2 adults/1-2 little kids. The grounds are amazingly pretty. If you don't want to deal with any people, this beach is for you. Downside is the rough surf, which was hazardous all but 3 days of our 6. There are other beaches to spend time in, but this is a walker's/local fisherman's beach; only 5 people seen per hour. Excellent sunsets! And having an"
40,Spent a week in Puerto searching for property and used the Posada as home base. Great staff. Food was great. Room was clean. Best beach. Its not a resort with partying and boozing. Relax & chill best describes.
40,"Heading for a third stay at this hotel.  The beach is amazing; the beach pool is a great respite from the heat and the upper level pool is too.  The location is particularly good for a sunset view.  The buffet meals are just fine with both Mexican and ""American"" food on offer (and a good soup every day at lunch).  At breakfast, the staff are ready to make omelettes to order..  After day 1, the staff know that I want tea instead of coffee - they are very attentive.  I wonder why guests quibble about the rooms?  How much time do they spend in them?  They are standard size, clean and comfortable.  As for bugs, well this is the tropics."
40,"this hotel is what I would call a typical Mexican hotel.we stayed for a week[leave tomorrow]and were about the only gringos here!we came via sunwing and it was pretty cool getting off the plane with hundreds of others and being the only ones getting in a taxi from huatulco to Puerto!left in freezing weather and now zooming up 200 with icy cerveza from the gas station and windows wide open!!ahhhhh.if you want sandals or secrets, real is not for you.if you realize that your room is for sleeping and washing in and want a great experience give this place a try.the grounds and rooms etc are as described by others but I have ZERO complaints about them.the staff and manager are wonderful,kind and smiling tho the staff have limited English. we were spoilt tho as our first few days were"
40,"we had a great time at the posada real the hotel is in a beautiful setting overlooking the beach , all the staff is really helpful and friendly the grounds around the hotel are well kept and maintained we really enjoyed Cocos Beach club,the Beach is amazing , no big crowds, just a great place to  relax, food, drinks and service is great at Cocos Yes, the rooms are very basic and could use some TLC, but you don't spend much time in your room anyway overall, we believe it is a great value and we are planning to stay at the posadsa real again"
30,We stayed here due to a flight being cancelled and were pretty disappointed with the quality of the room. The rooms are very very basic and minimal. Not to mention we saw cockroaches in the room and it is supposed to be 5 stars! Food from the restaurant was horrible and greasy too Americanized for our liking. On a more positive note there are good views and good pools to pass the day; however there are better places to stay in puerto Escondido.
50,I have been going to this hotel for the last 4 years.  I usually stay 3 weeks.  I have always been satisfied with everything there.  Ines is a very caring person who works very hard to see that her guests are happy.  I am again returning in Jan. 2007 for 6 weeks and would not stay anywhere else in Puerto.  I have met a lot of great people that also go there every year. 
50,"On a recommnedation from the Lonely Planet Guide, I just showed up one day and stayed in a nice and clean room at a reasonable price for almost a week. The place is bigger than you think and accomodations from basic to posh. Free wireless Internet is offered, albeit slow -  just ask Ines.   The food was excellent, the staff friendly and the atmosphere relaxed.  Hard-core surfers mix well here with families with small kids. German management ensures smooth operation.   A small but efficient diving outfit is located on the premises - Dive master Lorenzo took good care of me despite the low visibility. Same goes for a local surf instructor. I spontaneoulsy took a Spanish lesson with Barbara, a retired expatriate and wished I'd had started the lessons earlier. I learned a lot in"
10,"First and foremost, my wife and I are seasoned travellers. We are used to staying in budget hotels and are not whiney Americans. Room was nothing spectacular, but seemingly ok. Refrigerator was a little dirty inside, stove was the same. We enjoyed the pool during the day, restaurant is very good. Everything seemed quiet and nice. Unfortunately evening came and a sequence of events unfolded, making our 1 night stay here awful. We were supposed to stay 6 nights. Hotel Ines is located a couple of doors down from the Rockaway Hotel. They have live concerts there. Very loud live concerts. Loud blaring heavy metal music echoed around our room in the evening. It was so loud it was like we were actually there. We can take street noise, drunks singing loudly, machine noise - this was"
40,"After a two week stay in Oaxaca City, I had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Ines on Playa Zicatela for a couple of nights with my kids.  From the moment we arrived, we were pleased.  The hotel is small but offers an abundance of services, all at a very reasonable price.  Early mornings were spent enjoying a coffee by the pool followed by a walk on the beach.  Following two busy days, I had a massage in the health club, very relaxing and worthwhile.  Ines and her father Peter have done a wonderful job with Hotel Ines.  I will look forward to returning - hopefully soon, and I strongly recommend it. "
50,"We came to the hotel on New Years eve, without reservations, and Inez got us a modest room & told us she would move us as soon a a more suitable became available.  She did & we were very pleased with the room, food & the interesting people we met during our three weeks at the hotel.  The food was great service fine, location the greatest.  We are going back for two months January of 2006. "
50,"From the day I arrived, the people were kind and helpful, and more than willing to work with my inadequet spanish to say the least! The ladies that clean your room everyday are very polite and accomadating. Overall the proximity to the beach and nearby resuraunts was excellent! The Bartender, ""Leo""not only charmed us with his classic mexican songs on the guitar, But excellent service as well! Thanks, Lorenzo and Inez... I hope to see you soon! Eddie "
50,"We spent 2 great weeks at Beach hotel Ines. Staff looked after you and if you needed anything they did their best to help. My wife and I hope to make a return visit, no question to where we would stay."
50,"What a great vacation. This was my first destination in mexico outside the regular all-inclusive thing. It was a little different but very enjoyable. The price was unbeatable, the food was good and it is right across the street from the main break on Zicatella. I checked out some pretty luxurious rooms that were around 600 pesos but we stayed in one more modest for 240. We will be staying there next time for sure."
20,"I booked rooms well in advance (for December 2002) and then a Mexican friend confirmed everything. Upon arrival, one of our three rooms had not been booked. The Receptionist at the hotel lied to me. She was hopelessly inefficient. Luckily it was not full so we had other rooms to choose from but we had to pay more! The German owner was as cold as ice towards us. He appeared totally disinterested in our problem. We stayed since very quickly all acc. in Puerto became booked up( Christmas holidays). Rooms were fine. Food at restaurant was good, but service very slow. I had heard other reports that the owner was disinterested and cool towards guests. It´s true! I would not return to this hotel though. John Henshaw."
50,"Can't say any more than this was a rare find amongst hundreds of little hotels..the owners  are dedicated to making a little piece of heaven on a quiet street in a truly Mexican fishing town, If you are willing to take the trek by bus, (cheap)  or by Taxi (expensive)..it is definitely worth it. Fully booked was the way it was described by the owner, so book early or be disappointed.. We booked early and were totally satisfied..tiny, perfect, private, perfectly located."
40,"Large, nicely decorated with eclectic art.  Easy walk to one of the few places you can swim in PE and privileges at a local beach club if you want a pool.  In a quiet residential area that has good restaurants but still with in walking distance of the Mercado.  Owners were very helpful.  Our room came with continental breakfast that was unlimited very good coffee and toast only, but made from good bread and good jam. Our room wasn't on the road and was quiet.  No A/C so the fan was at hard work to keep the room cool but I won't complain about the heat."
50,"Loved this hotel, it was so clean and the garden was fantastic! the owners were very friendly and welcoming and eager to help us even when we turned up 4 hours too early! Breakfasts in the garden are lovely especially the fruit salad. Its about 5 mins walk away from Playa Carrizalillo. Would definitely come back!"
50,This is a cute hotel close to Playa Carrizalillo. The beach is less than 5 mins walk away from the hotel. The courtyard garden is beautiful with sculptures dotted around. The best bit is actually the friendliness of Manfred and Angie who owns the place. Ever so helpful. The hotel is close to some great restaurants and cafés. It is also very easy to catch a taxi to go to other parts of Puerto Escondido - taxi costs only 20-30pesos.
30,"Stayed in a standard room with garden view. Comfy bed and quirky-pretty decor but a lot of mosquitos, no air-con, weak fan and ants in the room let it down.  It was really hot and they had put a plastic sheet under the bedclothes, which we had to remove to get any sort of comfort.  The included 'Breakfast' was only bread and coffee.  The owners are really nice and friendly and the location in the Rinconada area is great if u don't want the surfer party scene of the main P.E. strip.  Lots of nice cafes and restaurants meters away.  And a short walk to lovely beaches where u can swim.  Overall it was a cheap and pleasant stay, but we got better value elsewhere in Mexico.              "
50,"My daughters and I  have experienced the wonderful hospitality of Manfred and Angie for the past two years at Villa Mozart y Macondo.  We stay in the beautifully appointed  2-bedroom penthouse.  We love the location, cleanliness, wonderful food, safe environment and fantastic staff.  It's a very special place!"
50,"This small hotel in a quiet part of Puerto Escondido is a perfect spot to relax and unwind.  With only 8 rooms, and amazing garden that is lovingly tended to, and with managers Manfred and Angie available, the M y M is perfect for a few days of sun and beach.  There is a small restaurant that serves beautiful and reasonably priced breakfasts.  It is a 10 minute walk to the beautiful Playa Carrizanillo and there are many other restaurants available in the 3 blocks adjacent to the hotel.  We loved our stay there and would recommend it highly."
50,This was a great hotel perfectly located for the more idyllic beaches and good restaurants. What makes it special is the helpful nature and friendliness of the owner Manfred and the attention to detail that has gone in to building this lovely hotel and surroundings.  The breakfast (fruit and granola) is like a work of art in itself.   Manfred suggested a wild crocodile tour which was great fun. Just make sure your transportation is sorted out though. Highly recommended because it is beautiful and you get that personal touch and service which is very rare these days.
50,"The garden restaurant at Mozart is a hidden delight. Cool green shade, an eclectic mix of carvings, fabulous breakfast fare, made this spot our favourite place to start the day. There is a small fountain that blocks out the sounds of the street, two jazzy little parrots which are endlessly entertaining, and a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere which all combine to make one feel welcome. The food is tasty, traditional Mexican fare of eggs or burritos or tortillas, or a plate of fresh fruit with granola and yogurt. Excellent coffee and fresh squeezed juice are also on the menu. Mozart is hidden, you must enter the restaurant from the back street behind the hotel, but worth scouting out!"
40,"We spent a week at this hotel and were happy that we'd found it.  It is small (maybe 8 rooms?) and plain, but very comfortable, a great location within walking distance to one of the best beaches, and serving a large and delicious breakfast (included in room).  As others have said, Manfred and Angie go out of their way to make visitors comfortable, as do the other staff.  It is very reasonably priced and made the whole trip quite affordable.  Highly recommended."
50,"The Lili folks planned for us a world class wedding weekend. Our correspondence had been through email and a few Skype calls, so it was hard to know how it was all going to come together.  It turned out to be so much better than we could have ever envisioned.  The vendors they employed including the florist, makeup artist, cake, dance instructor, deejay and especially the boleros, were talented & professional.  The Villa proved to be a perfect venue for our Friday night welcome party and the ceviche and tinga feast was a hit with the guests.  The Lili folks were such gracious hosts we never had to worry about how are guests were getting along in Puerto. This included a few in my family who were terrified of visiting Mexico – (they are already planning their return trip!)  Adel"
50,"My boyfriend and I just came back from his sisters wedding in Puerto Escondido.  We stayed at Villa Lili at the recommendation of his sister, who had previously stayed there with her soon to be husband.  Adelina and her brother, who own and run the hotel, were incredibly friendly and treated all of us as family.  Adelina was the wedding planner and she did an absolutely amazing job on giving the bride and groom the wedding of their dreams.  The hotel was beautiful, incredibly clean, and the staff was amazing.  No request was too large; they were able to make our vacation an absolutely amazing experience.  If and/when we go back to Puerto Escondido, we will definitely be staying at Villa Lili.    J&M"
50,My partner and I had stayed at Ade's other place Quinta Lilli but we had gone up to Playa Del Carmen we got the end of a cyclone and I got sick so we decided to back to Puerto as we loved it so much the first time around.  We stayed in Villa Lilli this time up in the master room.  The rooom was spacious and clean and has everything you need for your stay.  Ade had arrnaged to get me to the doctors and Had her friedn translate as i didnt speak any spanish.  They were all so helpfula dn it was the best place for me to stay when feeing that way they ladies made me chicken soup and were very caring. The pool is a bit bigger so really nice for swimming and lounging around the pool.  Again some of the best traditional Mexican food we had was here.  We will defnately be booking a trip
50,"Villa Lili is tucked in part of town (Rinconada) that's mellower but near it all - specifically, stunning sparsely used beaches in this under the radar, non-resort hidden town. The property is beautiful in every way - building, landscaping (incredible orchids!), pools, decor. But the greatest thing here: the host and staff. Everyone is a total love, - helpful and friendly. Breakfasts are outstanding (missing them right now!). I can't wait to return like many other reviewers here on TA! "
50,"I stayed at Villa Lili in the summer of 2013 while I was on a solo journey around Mexico. The owner, Adelina, is interesting and very friendly. She makes you feel welcome in the hotel that she and her brother designed and built. The rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The breakfasts are delicious and her wall of rare orchids is spectacular."
50,"We spent 3 nights at Villa Lili, 2 adults and 2 children (17 11) during August 2013. We felt like a scene from the MAMA MIYA movie. Everything was perfect and Adelina, the owner, was so gentle and thought about all our needs. The breakfasts were fresh and delicious. The outdoor is so beautiful and the swimming pools were just right, with the relaxing energy all around us. We felt at home and we got all the support to visit the right sites.  Thank you so much for everything! hope to come back!!!"
50,My husband and I just spent 3 days here ( will come back for longer next time )and had a wonderful time. Adelina is lovely and very helpful and her English was a god send to us because we speak almost no Spanish. The staff are all very very nice and the property is just fantastic. Its the best place to stay in the Puerto Escondido region. It's near a good swimming beach and also near some great restaurants and cafes !! The breakfasts here are homemade and simply scrumptious. Don't miss out on this treat.
50,"We stayed at Villa Lili in late July.  The architecture, energy efficient rooms and outdoor spaces are spectacular.  We really felt like special guests rather than hotel occupants.   The breakfasts were delicious featuring different local hearty but healthy entrees each morning.  Adelina chatted with us during breakfast about local events, culture, politics, economics and helped us plan our day of leisure.   We came home to cool off and relax in the beautiful pools, soft music, and incense.  This is one of my best vacations to Oaxaca because of Villa Lili."
50,"Fabulous!!!! We were there from July 25th to 29th.This is a precious and great place to be; they have excellent and lots of food and we got fabulous care from Adelina, Luis, Irene, Silvia, Francisco and Fernando. They went far and beyond to make us feel at home.  All the recommendations they gave us were great!!! The sea zafari,  Lizards’ farm and Laguna de Menialtepec trips were amazing! The owner took care of us since we arrived at the airport; a taxi cab was waiting for us and they paid for the service; on the 25th we were there @ 8 am and gave us breakfast and she didn’t charge us for it. They upgraded our room with a better one and they didn’t charge us extra for it! Adelina drove us over to the Lizard farm and, she didn’t accept money for the gas! She is so nice and"
50,"While it may be difficult to trust the numerous excellent Tripadvisor reviews on Villa Lili, they are true. We stayed three nights in Villa Lili -- this wonderful oasis in Puerto Escondido. The architecture is eclectic and the design features are beautiful. The yard, with its two pools, jacuzzi, charming outdoor eating area, plants of every kind, birds and the orchid garden -- the very heart of Vila Lili -- is simply astonishing. The rooms are spacious and elegantly designed with high ceilings, big balconies and comfortable beds. Every morning we enjoyed a delicious communal breakfast around the big table by the pool, with fresh fruits, juice and local, delicious dishes made individually for each guest. The staff were warm, welcoming, professional and service-minded and made us"
50,"Stayed at this wonderful boutique hotel for 5 nights. As other say, the owner Adelina was attentive, helpful and quickly booked us on amazing activities. It's a 5 min walk to the most beautiful beach-away from the majority of tourists and surfers. Also a quick walk to restaurants and bars. Everyday our room was immaculately cleaned (including folding our clothes)! The breakfasts were healthy, local, and delicious. I would absolutely recommend Quinta Lili to any friend or family member. A trip to remember."
50,I am an ex-pat living and working in Mexico. I have done a lot of travelling and can definitely say that this is my favourite hotel in Mexico.   The owner Adelina made my wife's birthday unforgettable.  Skip the industrial resorts and stay at the Quinta Lili for a wonderful experience.  -A
50,"Quinta lili is an absolute haven of simplicity and relaxed hospitality. It is a place for intimate conversation with Adelina and friends, awesome, fresh, local food, great advice on what to do in Puerto and assistance making it happen - from cooking classes to floating in the lagoon at night during bioluminescence, releasing baby turtles or eating freshly shucked oysters on the beach. Quinta lili and villa lili are both well designed, secure and peaceful places with beers in the fridge and an honour system that speaks volumes about the kind of friendliness you can expect. This place is really one to go back to. In fact we didn't want to leave! "
50,"Quinta Lili was everything we expected from a hotel and MORE!  The hotel is in walking distance from food, the beach and even surf lessons. They received us with excellent tips on what tours to take, where to go out for a drink, all sorts of delicious food, and how to get around. We stayed at a 3 bed regular bedroom and it was perfect: clean towels for the beach & shower, hot water, clean linens and even mosquito repellent.  But what really makes a difference from any other hotel service around is the hospitality of the people working at QL... Adelina is the best host I've ever met. Sure to go back!!!"
50,We had such a lovely time at Quinta Lili. The place itself is beautiful and there is always relaxing music playing. We had a beautiful room which was always left looking immaculate after Magda had cleaned.  We really enjoyed the breakfast each morning and chatting with Adelina and Magda. Both were so lovely and helpful.  Adelina goes out of her way to make sure all guests have what they need and helped us make a call to our airline to sort some things out. She truely was so helpful and it is very obvious why this place is number 1 on trip advisor.  The place itself is a little way from town but cabs are inexpensive and walking is fine if its not too hot. Lots of beautiful beaches and great restaurants nearby.  We would definitely recommend. 
50,"We stayed at Quinta Lili for a weekend trip. We arrived at Puerto Escondido to find rain was expected for a while stay. Ade made sure everything about our stay was perfect, arranging activities and sightseeing that made this trip way better than we expected. We can't wait to go back! "
50,"My fiance and I unfortunately only had two days in Puerto Escondido, but thanks to our wonderful host Adelina we definitely got the most out of it and had the most magical time. We swam in a lagoon that lit up in the night, spent a morning swimming with turtles and dolphins and got to eat at some of the best restaurants in town filled with fresh Pacific ocean delights. Quinta Lilli is also nicely located to the beach, so any spare hour we had was spent lounging in the sun. Adelina, our host, organised absolutely everything and even drove us to the airport at the end of our last day - always with a warm smile on her face. Breakfast was also incredibly delicious at Quinta Lilli! I still have cravings for the Mexican delights that were served up there. I can't recommend this place"
50,"Staying at Quinta Lilli was the highlight of our trip to Mexico. Adelina really applied so much effort to make our stay perfect. She is a friendly and wonderful host, and cooked us the most incredible Mexican breakfasts each morning . She also went out of her way to help us with booking flights and organising our transport for tours etc. She even offered us a Mexican cooking class.  We stayed on the first floor and the rooms were well-equipped and very clean. Magdalena was very sweet and did an impeccable job with housekeeping. It is located only about 300m from Carazillio beach, which in my opinion is the most beautiful beach in Puerto.  I truly believe our stay in Puerto would not have been the same if we stayed elsewhere. The only place to stay in Puerto! We definitely will"
50,"This hotel is small and personal, with amazingly warm and kind hosts. It is near a lovely, small beach and several excellent restaurants. This is definitely one of the loveliest locations that we have stayed in in Mexico. I will be recommending it to all my friends, and hope to return myself! We stayed in the top floor suite, which comes with an outdoor spa and a mezzanine with a view out to the sea. It was perfect."
50,"We stayed at Quinta Lili for 5 days.  The rooms were very comfortable, cool at night with ceiling fans, great showers, lovely swimming pool.  Breakfast was different every day, and delicious, with great Mexican cuisine.  Beautiful beach within a 5 minute walk; kids learned to surf with plenty of instructors on the beach who were always eager to teach.  Many side trips available--turtle watching, dolphin watching, swimming at night in phosphorescent lagoon, early morning bird watching on the lagoon.  The best part, however, were the people at Quinta Lili.  Adelina is a wonderful host--young, vivacious, energetic.  She gave us plenty of information, arranged the side trips, did a lot of the cooking herself, and personally took us to the airport  (about 5 minutes away) in her van. "
50,"I had an absolutely amazing time staying at Puerto surf house!! David is a fantastic host and surf teacher with a great relaxed, laid-back attitude. The property is beautiful, a great place to relax and the rooms are clean, spacious and very comfortable. David and Oscar make sure that you only get the best waves and that you are safe at all times. I couldn't recommend Puerto surf house more - you'll have fun learning how to surf, meet great people and be able to chill out in a beautiful environment!!"
40,"This modern three storey home is a lovely 'port in the storm' away from the 'surfing youth crowd' on the nearby streets.   Although that is what David does as his second job...offer surfing instruction....The community kitchen is used for snacks and breakfast, and it all feels very safe and quiet.   Boards are neatly stacked around the property, and the owner is very helpful.    My son took a few lessons while we were there, and I gladly sat on the beach, and dipped into the ocean to body surf.   The single bed room was filled, but the KING size bed was extremely comfortable, mosquito net and all.  Some great restaurants around the village, and a wonderful authentic French/Swiss bakery.  Book as many days as you can at this affordable rate.  Taxi's are plentiful, as well as the"
50,"The house is located at La Punta which is a great location for surfing. Playa zicatela is about 20 minutes walking from La Punta which is great. The house is very beautiful and relaxing. As for the surf classes, David is an awesome surfteacher, he got me standing on my first day. Safety is very important for him which is great and he will always make sure that you catch the bests waves. All with all I have had a great experience in the house and I would recommened it to everybody who wants to relax and fall in love with surfing."
50,"We had a fantastic stay at the Puerto Surf House and made some great friends. The Surf House itself is beautiful, very clean and in the best location, just 50 yards from La Punta, a great right hand wave off the point. David was very cool and easy going, he didn't have any problems with us staying longer and then having to leave a day earlier than planned. He has a nice selection of boards, mainly for beginners but a couple of shortboards too for intermediate surfers. Price is good value for money, we'd definitely go back and totally recommend to anyone heading to Puerto. The streets are sandy and you can easily get a taxi into the main town to surf or party. We had a great time, thank you very much! Nicy and James."
50,"I stayed at the Surf House for five fun days. It's a small place (they now have four rooms) and is away from the main Zicatela tourist area at La Punta. I much preferred La Punta - it is really peaceful. There are still good cheap places to eat nearby, plus a few small stores, and the main town is only a 5 minute 30 peso taxi ride away (or a 40 minute walk along the beach).   Most important, the house is right by the beach and La Punta's surf break. The rooms are clean and large and super good value. The place has a nice garden with shade and hammocks. David is friendly and helpful (Swantje was in Germany while I was there).   They have short and long boards for rent. I didn't take surf lessons (already surf) but other guests spoke very highly of David as a teacher."
50,"I stayed at Puerto Surf for a week. All my expectations were met and even exceeded! They offer really great value. Nice rooms (double or twin available) with bathroom, there is a kitchen with fridge for everybody to use and hammocks to chill in the shade. The surf lessions (with Jesus/ Chicharon, David was on vacation) were a lot of fun and he really made sure that we only caught  good waves. As the equipment is free to use outside the lessons we were able to practice a lot, which really helped. Swantje also gave me a Thai massage, which I can really just recommend to everybody, very relaxing. Overall it is safe to say, that Puerto Surf offers everything you need and want for a superb price and the environment is super friendly and nice.  I am sure I will be there again! BTW:"
40,I really enjoyed my stay here at this surf house. It has a great location and great amosphere. Good rooms and good value.i plan to go back to mexico and I will stay here again.puerto escondido is a really cool town. Epic waves and fun nightlife.
50,"I stay there for a week, taking surfing lessons with David (great teacher) and enjoying their hospitality. The rooms are comfortable and clean, the garden has an space with a table, chairs and hammocks were you can relax, enjoy time with other surfers and have a nice bbq. 2 mins from La Punta Beach, restaurants, shops and bars. A taxi can take you downtown for 30 pesos. I will definitely return asap"
50,Hands down the best place to stay and learn to surf...
50,"David and Swantje are muy buena gente. Their rooms are very nice, comfortable and clean. There is a nice garden with table, chairs and hammocks to relax. They are a 2 minute walk from the beach and even nearer to shops, bars, restaurants etc. There is a choice of beaches to surf depending on the weather and your ability. I have been there twice and will hope to go back again if i get the chance later in the year! HIghly recommended"
10,"This hotel is a rip-off. They take the money ($200 in our case) off your credit card before you arrive. Then they give you a hostel-style room with 1970s furniture, dirty beds and cockroaches. When you complain they tell you with a big fat grin that they already have your money and won't give anything back. Advice: stay away from this place!"
50,"I really loved hotel Casamar. I came with friends for a yoga retreat and had a very pleasant time here. It is very close to ocean-3 minutes walking distance . Gated hotel and secure. Very beautiful garden surroundings, clean pool, hammocks, birds are singing- like a little paradise!  Zicatela beaches were rough for swimming but hotel workers always helpful with taxi and in few minutes I was swimming at very nice playa/beach with super warm water, nice little restaurants around. You can go any- Carrisalillo or Puerto Anjelitos beach. Beds in a room were little on a stiffer side but pillows were the best I ever had at any hotel."
30,"We had an overall pleasant stay at Casamar but we definitely have mixed feelings and were turned off about a few things.   I'll start with the pros to be fair:  - Feels very secure (although Puerto is safe in general) - The grounds are well kept and there is plenty of space for guests to sprawl out without feeling cramped.  - The staff are nice, honest and responsive. I left quite a bit of money in the pocket of my pants and accidentally put the pants in to be laundered. The lady saved the money and returned it in full.  - There are quite a few amenities (some free). We played ping pong and did yoga which was fun.  - The kitchens were reasonably well equipped and we were able to do a lot of our own cooking.   Cons:  - For such a pricey place (which we know because we've stayed"
50,"Our apartment was lovely, staff and management were friendly and helpful, the grounds and pool were lovely and well maintained, we enjoyed the yoga, we didn't use the restaurant.  The hotel feels like a little oasis. It is a short walk to the beach and the La Punta village strip and a short and inexpensive cab ride to the city commercial area and the Zicatella strip. "
50,"Everything about it appealed to our travel style. Adjacent to ""real Mexico"", local artisan decor, option to cook at home, order from the onsite cook, or wander off for local cuisine steps away. Wonderful pillows, impeccable cleaning, nonchlorinated pool, secure gated entrance, tropical garden right out our door. Guests are known by first name, and treated more like family than customers. With the 3 km ocean shoreline close by, we were offered beach chairs, umbrellas and towels for loan. The area seems yet undiscovered, a hidden gem... no crowds, no high rise apartments, no cruise ships. We will be back for sure, like  most of the neighbours we met there. "
40,The staff are all so helpful and friendly. The suite was fully equipped; all the comforts of home. The foot reflexoloflgy treatments available were excellent !!  The pool was refreshing and relaxing. We really enjoyed the location close to some great restaurants and of course the beautiful beach goes on for a long time with swimming and easier surfing. available. 
50,"We did a Christmas family reunion here. We wanted the security of having staff on-site to assist with any medical problems, as well as travel logistics. The staff were always immediately available, and very professional in their help. The garden is perfect for kids and relaxing, as is the pool. The daily yoga was wonderful, tailored to the needs of the group. At times our little group were the only ones there. The staff involved with classes or front desk speak English. La Punta is quiet, surfy, and hippy. "
50,"Casamar is exactly as announced on the website: clean swimming pool, beautiful garden, daily yoga clases, peaceful atmosphere; with one additional aspect, which makes it special and recommendable: human contact."
40,"The grounds and staff are outstanding; the room is pleasant; the beach is near.  A best part, and one we discovered on our own, is up the street, to the right about half miles is a surfer's paradise, 1960's style -- palm cover bistros, board shops, etc.  A real nice feel to it.  Getting to town is a bit harder ... a 10 minute taxi ride.  Beyond the cool surfing area, there's not much within walking district but one feels the promise of further development in the area is just beginning.  A laid back place to relax."
50,"This quality hotel is a quiet oasis of good sized, and well equipped rooms, set around beautiful gardens and a swimming pool. There is a large staff taking care of the property and guests, so that everything is clean and working properly. The hotel is completely enclosed with high walls and gates, so that you feel very safe and private. The position is perfect: close to the restaurants and shops of Punta, but being a short 5 min walk from that, ensures quiet.  Yoga and water aerobics were led by the delightful Norah, who is a very professional, enthusiastic and friendly teacher. This was a real highlight of our stay. These were complementary activities, which was a nice bonus. Our room got very hot, because it was poorly insulated with inadequate blinds, and air conditioning was"
50,"Our stay at the Villas was terrific.  The Terraza Villa has a wonderful view and everything needed for a trip to the mercado and relaxing meals.  The staff was outstanding - friendly, prompt and accommodating as needed.   We will return.  Hopefully soon.   Gracias."
50,"It was family vacation - first time visiting Mexico in general and Oaxaca in particular. Great location, fantastic beach, awesome villas, friendly and polite staff - highly recommended! Villas have everything you need to make your time enjoyable and your stay comfortable. Staff is ready to address any concern in the most friendly way. The restaurant serves simply fantastic food. Would recommend this place to everyone."
50,A wonderful place to spend a week!  Beautiful sunsets!  Great bartender!  Terrific restaurant! Staff were kind and helpful! We can't wait to go back! The rooms under the restaurant could be a little noisy at times but they don't stay open too late.
50,"This place is located at the top of the beautiful Carrizalillo Beach. The views from the hotel are stunning and it's worth even just going for a meal to enjoy the landscape along with the delicious food. Our villa, Puebla, had a balcony facing the bay where we enjoyed breakfast everyday. The kitchen was well equipped and the bed extremely big and comfortable. The bathroom was good, the only downside being the shower which wasn't powerful enough. As said before, the food at the restaurant, Espadin, was very good. I would recommend trying the ""tostadas de huachinango"", ""huachinango a la talla"", ""mariscada""  and ""ensalada oaxaqueña"". It's worth noting that to access the beach from the hotel you need to go down several steps which would be difficult for someone older or unfit. For"
50,"We love this hotel and have enjoyed many visits over the years.  The view is fantastic, the rooms are very comfortable, the restaurant serves delicious food, the pool is lovely, and the place is staffed with wonderful people who afforded us lots of privacy.  We have taken friends and family to stay there and I recommend it to anyone who wants an elegant and relaxing stay in Puerto Escondido."
50,"Villas Carrizalillo is one of the most perfect places in the world. This was our second visit, and the natural beauty is just amazing.    We stayed at Villa Terazza, which has a huge private terrace with two hammocks, tables and chairs, a Jacuzzi tub and a full kitchen.  The view from the terrace is breathtaking.   My now fiancee worked with the owner, Amy, to craft the perfect, most romantic wedding proposal and staff at the hotel worked to set up a surprise of champagne, roses and candles while we were watching the sunset at Espadín restaurant upstairs. Amy even brought sparkling coder from the states, so that I could toast since I don't drink alcohol.  We are do grateful to the hotel and staff for making our stay so very special!    The hotel is in a great, international"
50,"We spent 8 days at Villas Carrizalillo and it was just amazing. Could easily have stayed longer. A short walk to beautiful Playa Carrizalillo for surf, sup boarding, smorkling and relaxing on the beach!"
50,"Three friends and I stayed at Villas Carrizalillo for one night at the beginning of October and it was delightful! The hotel is beautiful, clean and has amazing views. We stayed in Villa Florencia, which had two beds - one double and one queen - and was perfect for four friends. Very reasonable price!"
50,"Needed to find a place for a night, drove around and accidentally came upon these villas. It was the first place we came across and as soon as we saw the room we knew we didn't have to keep looking. With an awesome view of the bay, and large-sized room with boutique decorations, we felt very comfortable and relaxed right away, also because the place itself is small and did not feel commercial at all. Would recommend it to anyone."
50,"Beautiful hotel with the best view.. The staff very nice.. I will be going back!!! Clean rooms, with gorgeous view.. They lent us bikes everyday so we could go to town..  The restaurant also is very nice and great food... I recommend Villas Carrizalillo 100%"
50,"We've stayed at the Hotel Paraiso Escondido three times, for a total of nine weeks, and each  time it was better than the last.  What makes the Hotel is the Mexican/Spanish ambience and Sergio's willingness to always assist in any way possible.  The Hotel Paraiso Escondido has it's own pool, air conditioning, kitchen facilties and is centrally located to ATM's, laundry, groceries, restaurants and within walking distance of  several beautiful beaches."
40,"Spent a week at the Paraiso Hotel in Puerto Escondido and can't really find much to complain about. My son and I had a suite, which looked out onto the pool and ocean. Spacious, clean, good shower and aircon system. Wifi available on request. Excellent value for money. Sergio, the manager, and the rest of the staff were very kind and helpful and the former organised our fishing trip and flight up to Oaxaca. Few tourists in PE at this time of the year. I would definitely recommend this hotel (10 mins walk from ocean, 5 from local stores, ATM nearby....)"
50,"We stayed here in January for a couple of nights. It was very reasonably priced, even for a suite. All the hotel rooms with a balcony had a lovely view of the beach, and the pool is a really bonus! The owners were really friendly and very happy to help, we were able to extend our stay for a few hours while waiting for our return journey at a really good price. The hotel is minutes away from the main beach and restaurants, and a short walk from some of the quieter beaches and the market. Food was good, and internet access made the stay thoroughly enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"
50,"Stayed here last novembre, what a great experience.  A very friendly yet professional, family run establishment.   Sergio couldn't have been more accommodating.  Set back from the craziness of the beachfront this hotel was calm and relaxing but not too far away from anything.  Unique and affordable rooms plus a beautiful view.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would recommend this place to anyone."
40,"I know....why do you need wi-fi in a relaxed place like Puerto Escondido?  Well, we are addicted to our e-mails and news at home and Facebook.  So we were quite unhappy when the signal either couldn't be found by our computers or wasn't strong enough to get to the third floor.  We tried connecting at the restaurant, also without success, though did see people connected there the following day.  The signal never worked in four full days in our room.  Otherwise, the hotel is very beautiful.  It is on somewhat of a hill, so it has very nice views of the sea, one beach, and possibly the sunset, though not in January...the sun sets too far north. Though it is not a new hotel, it has been very well taken care of.  The suite that we stayed in on the top floor was in excellent"
50,"Friendly staff, Lovely swimming pool for cooling off. Rooms very clean and comfortable, small library of second hand books in various languages. Bar with cold drinks and hot snacks close to pool. Close to beaches and bars / restaurants but not too close to hear late night party scene. Highly Recommended"
50,"We stayed in Hotel Paraiso Escondido during the Christmas / New Year period. We booked at the last minute and Sergio, the manager, worked to accommodate us.   The room was clean and comfortable. The water was hot. Everything worked. Some things were a little tired and worn and quirky. For example the air conditioning unit was old and rather noisy. The grounds and building are spectacular, with a lush lawn and nice pool. Our room had a balcony with a beautiful view of the ocean.  Sergio was a godsend and super helpful. He speaks excellent English and was easy to deal with. The rest of the staff were friendly and helpful.  The location was perfect. We were just far enough up the hill to catch a slight breeze, but close enough to the beach and amenities that it was very convenient."
50,"This hotel is beautiful, quiet, and has an old-world charm.  The hotel and grounds are decorated with artistic touches.  The staff are extremely friendly and willing to do anything for you. This is a place to escape the hectic world - to relax and enjoy.  A real gem."
50,Nice location close to all. Lots of history to look at in this place . Service was good . No problem  If you want old style Mexico this is a place that has some of that 
50,"We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Paraiso Escondido. The staff was the friendliest that i have have ever experienced, the rooms were clean and beautiful with fabulous views, and the location is very central and convenient. I would come back in a heartbeat, and actually after our experience here, we are thinking of coming back next month."
50,"I found this Hotel having read the previous Tripadvsor comments and I am so glad I did.  I had been working/travelling throughout Mexico for 5 weeks and had come up coast from Mazunte on the way to Oaxaca.  This Hotel is clean and stylish and has a lovely boutique feel.  The rooms are large and spacious and lovingly decorated in local colours and style with individual murals and stencils throughout.  The rooftop terrace is sublime in its own right but is a particulary lovely spot from which you can watch the sun go down.  Paul was helpfulness himself and made everything effortless.  An absolute diamond of a place, but don´t tell everyone! "
50,"This was my first trip to Mexico. My wife had been there several times, in another life. We had planed to go to Oaxaca City, but do to the political unrest, we went to Plan B.  We flew into Huatulco on Saturday, October 28th, 2006. We spent the first two nights in Puerto Angel, and then moved to Puerto Escondido and the Hotel Flor de Maria on Monday Oct. 30th, and departed on Saturday, Nov 4, 2006. I chose this hotel based on reviews on TripAdvisor, and I'm glad we did.   We also had room #15, as did an eariler reviewer. What a view!! The rooms were comfortable and the whole hotel was kept spotless. I wanted rest and relaxtion on this vacation, so I did not miss AT ALL not having a phone or TV. There was a computer with internet access in the lobby, so I could check my email and"
50,"This was my second time in Puerto Escondido this year in this hotel and I booked again for 3 weeks in February. I must admit I have been coming down here for several years now. Just can't get enough of this place. The perfect weather, the beach,  the sunsets and the romantic atmosphere here are second to none. The hotel is small but cozy and very charming, and very reasonably priced even in the high season. I guess I don't like big hotels. There is something more personal here. The attention to detail and friendship you feel from the owners Paul and Joanne you can't get from any big hotel manager. And if you like gourmet food you don't have to leave this hotel. Best meals in town. Guaranteed. And if you happen to like deep sea fishing, it's a paradise. Even if you don't like"
50,"My wife and I thought this hotel was great.  We spent nine days there at the beginning of August.  In contrast to the last person who reported, we got exactly what we were expecting, and certainly with Paul and Joanne there were no problems in  communicating or with their trying to accomodate us.  (We were in Room #15, which has a small balcony and a view.)  I thought the hotel's location--half a block up from Marinero Beach, and between the two main beaches--made going to either of the two larger beaches, Zicatela or Principal, very easy.  With the view from the roof terrace you could see the harbor of Puerto Escondido, the sun setting over the lighthouse to the northwest, and the waves crashing along the beach.  The roof has a pool, which, although small, is very pleasant, and"
30,"While certaintly a value, my wife and I were not given what we were promised for the price we paid, despite having reservations for months.  We had asked for a ocean view with balcony.  We received a second floor room with an alley view and no balcony.  Despite some basic Spanish-English communication, we could not rectify the situation.  The restaurant/bar is currently closed until July.  The rooms were clean and amenities acceptable.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Would this be our choice for a return trip to Puerto Escondido?  Probably not. "
40,"Friendly and quiet hotel - at least in the low season. On a side road leading to the beach, about 5 minutes walk from the main swimming beach and the town with restaurants and shops. 10 minutes walk the other way leads to Zicatela one of the 5 best surf beaches in the world but NOT for swimming. Hotel is well-maintained and probably exactly what it should be for the price level. Totally clean with good beds.No aircon but ceiling fans - and it can get hot. Inroom lock-box for valuables. Resonable shower etc, but in May only warm water (though this is not a real problem). Best feature by far is the rooftop terrace with small swimming pool and hammocks under a thatched roof. View to the ocean is unobstructed and it´s a haven of peace. Also the one TV in the hotel (with cable) is"
40,"We stayed at Hotel Flor de Maria for 4 days in February and were very pleased with price and the service.  The restaurant is fabulous and makes everyone feel welcome and at home.  The rooftop pool is small, but perfect for a quick cool down and the view is excellent.  Although we are young and most of the guest were of retirement age, we had a great time.  My only criticism is that our room on the ground floor was a bit dank - the bathroom flooded after every shower and had a bit of a musty feel.  The only other disappointment was the cold showers, but for the price we didn't expect luxury.  We didn't see the rooms on the upper floors, but judging from the reviews they must be nicer. "
50,"Stayed in the Hotel Flor de Maria Hotel in Puerto Escondido from Feb. 20 to Feb. 27, 2006. Paul and Joanne run an excellent hotel with reasonable rates. At times it seemed like ""heaven on earth."" Very safe; great restaurant; excellent service. Many local expats come to the restaurant for meals as Joanne is a wonderful chef. The repeat business each winter from the same people indicates the quality of this hotel. I was solo this time to meet friends and do some birding. They made me feel right at home and helped line up the primary birding guide I was trying to find. Rates very reasonable; location central; great view from the shaded top of the hotel. "
40,"Hotel Flor de Maria is a gem. Paul and Joanne couldn't be warmer hosts. The restaurant is in my opinion the best, most consistant kitchen in this town. It offers a nice variety of meat, chicken, fish and vegitarian dishes daily. Rooms (24) are comforable and clean. Staff is great. It has a pool on the rooftop as well as an pen air bar which is open from 5-9pm. A lovely courtyard as well. You can spend 3 times more for a room in this town and not get anything more than a larger towel. Please don't tell everyone about this find ,just the people you would like to see there. Thanks for a great 2weeks see you next year. "
50,"Wow - that's what we said everyday waking at this lovely hotel. We couldn't believe the service and accomodations we got for the great price. The location is convenient enough that we could be self sufficient, but the staff was friendly enough that if we needed assistance it was available. Unlike some hotels in Puerto - this one is not right in the mix of things, but is close enough to the action that you can easily walk to the beach or the market. If we are lucky enough to find ourselves in puerto again there is no doubt as to where we will stay. "
50,A must visit in Mexico. Together my family of 5 plus two other families of 4 spent one week together @ Vivo. Whether it was ordering breakfast or lunch to be ready for a desired time before an excursion or the lifeguards helping our kids learn to swim the staff constantly went above and beyond to take care of us. The staff in the kids club had lots of different activities to keep the kids occupied. The fitness club has an unbelievable view while the spa is centered around a great water feature. The brand new tennis courts and pickleball courts were a huge hit for us. Every room has a view of the ocean and the infinity pools were perfect to cool off in the day or watch a sunset. Our condo was furnished nicely with modern fixtures and appliances. Not to many places where you can
50,"My vacation was really enjoyable with my family, the installations of the hotel are excelent, the service was great. But the best part was that the activities staff took care of my kids, they are really fun to be around and they keep them intertwined with the activities. SIXTO (NACHO) from the ACTIVITIES STAFF / kids club staff it's so kind and fun and took care of the kids, he made our vacation excelent. The food is very delicious in the restaurant Ernesto's."
40,"The property is very, very nice.  About 25 minutes from the town.  There is a daily shuttle, but if you want to travel into town more often, have your own car.  The town isn't that big and you can't get lost.  Everyone at Vivo was very nice.  Unfortunately we got room 512 and it had a lot of problems from no hot water for three days to backed up sink in the bathroom and toilet seat needed to be replaced.  After three days of no hot water, they finally replaced the tankless water heater.  Because we didn't have no hot water for 3 days, they comped us breakfast.  Something better than nothing I guess.  They immediately fixed the other problems once they were made aware.  Again, everyone was very nice and helpful.  And the wifi is spotty at Vivo.  Other than that, I would go back. "
50,"One week in Vivo Resorts wasn’t enough. Puerto Escondido met and exceeded all our expectations. Jesus was the best tour guide we have ever had and Ramiro was terrific in the restaurant. If you are looking for a quiet vacation spot or the ultimate retirement condo or villa, this is it!  "
40,"We booked a Discovery Tour at Vivo for a quick get away and inquire about retirement living in Mexico.  The resort and staff are very nice.  Location is a bit remote, about 20 minutes to nearest town, Chila, and about 35 minutes to Puerto Escondido.  Long unpaved road from main road to the resort is not in the best shape (though we were told it is much better in the high season (winter months). We had a 2 bedroom ocean view unit.  Very nice and well appointed.  We had originally reserved a Penthouse Palapa unit but that had been impacted by recent storm.  Worked out well as the Palapa unit has air conditioning in bedroom and bath only with living space open to outside air.  It sounded nice on website, but with the summer weather, probably better we got moved.  Weather was very"
50,"Could not have dreamed of a better place to spend our honeymoon. The staff and resort were amazing, the food was great, and the views were perfect. The resort is easy to get to from the airport, and about 25 minutes from town. We can't recommend Vivo enought!"
50,Loved everything about it! Can’t wait to come back and for our condo to be built!! The staff are everything. They assisted us with everything we needed! We really enjoyed the turtles being released!!! 
50,"Amazing resort!  The 12 mile beach views were incredible.  The beach hardly ever had anyone on it. Very peaceful and quiet place.  The service from housekeeping to hospitality was excellent.  We really enjoyed the warmth and friendliness of the staff and condo owners, they made you feel like you were part of the Vivo family.  Peurto Escondido was such a charming small city, we are sure to return."
50,"I chose to stay at Vivo Resorts as I’m considering purchasing a condo here and was impressed with the presentation on the website. Vivo is a 20 minute drive north of the Puerto Escondido Airport. Located on a 12 mile stretch of beach; one could feel the beach is your own as often during our visit  (April 24 - 29) there was no one but us on the beach. The surf was quite strong during our visit, but strong swimmers could enter into the ocean. Lifeguards are also available to partner with you. We had a beach front condo and were immediately taken by the power of the crashing waves especially enjoyable as one falls asleep.The resort has two pools (one infinity) a spa and one of the best equipped gyms you’ll see in any hotel or resort. Dining options included: pool bar service, a"
50,"Right on a gorgeous Pacific beach, with impeccable facilities and friendly staff. You would never guess something this wonderful existed around Puerto Escondido. Fellow guests included many US and Canadian condo owners seeking a peaceful, sunny retreat. Staff was caring, kid-friendly and eager to help. Excellent food and drink options. Only downside is it's 30 minutes away from Puerto Escondido, but it wasn't a real issue for us."
40,"All aspects of the hotel/resort other than the room was great. The reception area and staff were friendly. The pool near the rooms was good. The Coco's Beach club a short walk or complimentary bus ride away was stunning. Great beach, good pool, nice food and drinks. They even cooked a fish I caught for me. However, the rooms are a real let down. Badly in need of modernisation, refurbishment and a good lick of paint. They bear little resemblance to the description given on the website. The beds claimed to be Tempurpedic, but were in fact not (although comfortable nonetheless). I could only receive the free wifi by placing my computer on the sink in the bathroom."
40,"Three star hotel, five star views! You can not turn around without seeing something beautiful. I'll do this in point form in the interest of brevity. Food- sketchy. Lucky there were eggs at breakfast because my palate is not international enough to eat tripe, beef tongue in green sauce or pig skin. Many inexpensive restaurants were a 25 peso cab ride away. Green taxis have a set rate to everywhere. Rooms- basic, no balcony so we got outside as soon as possible. It is sooo beautiful and peaceful, why would you want to be inside? Service- AMAZING. As many smiles and conversations as you are interested in. Someone who speaks some English is always available. Wait service at the beach at a 3 star, we were so spoiled. Don't forget to tip the people who don't get a lot of tips The"
40,"A hotel in Puerto Escondido with WiFi in the room is difficult to find and this place had it.Beautiful grounds and a short comp shuttle to the beach club.The rooms are pretty basic,smallish and tiny bathrooms but clean and adequate.Staff very friendly and grounds immaculate.The food was very average,we went out most nights in very reasonable taxi's to various excellent restaurants in town.Just a short taxi from the main surfing beaches,if that is of interest,otherwise the beach club more than measured up."
40,"We have heard good things about this part of Mexico. We arrived in the first week of January and things were very quiet. But in a great way, the sun loungers were easy to pick. We managed to have the lounger right on the edge of the beach. From here we had access to the stunning long beach that covers the coast line. What made this special was the surroundings and feeling of having a secluded beach with one impressive sunset. There are many rocks on in the beach and sea, and the ocean can be quite rough so this particular beach was very much for looking at and soaking up the sunsets. Watching the sun to down in the evenings is a peaceful and humbling experience. We did visit thiamin town, where the main surfing is held. This to me, felt like at other surfeing holiday destination"
40,"Even though this hotel is ranked only as a 3 star by Sunwing vacations, we found it quite adequate.  It was very clean, the grounds were beautiful and the staff (even though most did not speak very much english) very helpful and freindly.  The food was very good, mostly Mexican but there was always something for the more amercain diet.    The trip from the airport is probably about an hour and a half but our driver Guancho got us there safe and sound.  Nice guy.  Our Sunwing Rep Joaquin was waiting for us as well at the airport and was very friendly and heplful thoughout the week.  We have travel many places in Mexico, Playa del Carmen, Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta but Puerto Escondido is probably the best Mexican experience yet.  It was clean, friendly, great weather (we went in"
40,The hotel is very old but well maintained if you  don't expect renovations. It is located on a beautiful park-type property with spectacular view. Be careful: The rooms are small with  small windows; the web shows sea view windows which cost extra. The food we had  was always good;  the breakfast our favorite! But best  of all: All staff was very friendly and supporting although only few spoke English. This description is in a comparable way also valid  for the beach club.
30,"Price was right, room was adequate, beds not bad, room cleaned daily. The buildings, location, pool and beach club are good for beach/pool lovers, book reading and general relaxing. This hotel would work well for families, lots of them on hand when we were there just before Christmas. Puerto is a great place for surfing, beach, deep sea fishing, bird watching, visiting friends....the last three are reasons that drew us back. Only ate breakfast at the hotel during our week there, although we were on a meals included rate, so can't comment on lunch or dinner. Plenty of fresh fruit, granola, eggs to order at breakfast. Some of the staff were good, the young man making drinks acted like he was the son of the owners...not interested in being of service. My husband dubbed the place"
20,"This is my first ever Poor review - but this is one of those places you just know is bad from the moment you arrive. This place needs some serious TLC. The view is amazing, but the hotel is just completely dated - yet they charge a lot of money to stay here.  The rooms have tiny windows when they should have balconies. They stink of 20 years worth of cigarette smoke (non-smoking room), and the lighting in the room consists of 3 irritating fluro bulbs. Wifi doesn't stretch to a lot of rooms unless you are close to the foyer.  The pool is over chlorinated, the sun lounges are tatty and covered in bird boo. You have to wear a weird wrist band to access the Beach club that had some seriously overpriced and disgusting food. (that's if you could even get the attention of a waiter). "
30,"Stayed here the last week of December. It has a perfect location for easy access to a small beach and also to the large beach of Bacocho. The rooms are not luxurious, but the place is clean. The sound is not very well isolated, and it is easy to hear people in nearby rooms. It has also a great view of the ocean, perfect for the sunsets."
30,"My husband and I stayed here for a week from March 6-13, 2012.  It is an older hotel that used to be a Best Western.  It has beautiful views of Bacocho Beach and the Pacific as it is set high on a hill.  Their beach club, Coco's is a short transfer ride or a long walk down (and further, up! LOL!)  The beach club has a wonderful pool and beach area.  The water is not safe for swimming as there are huge waves, so stick to the pool unless you are an expert swimmer.  We really didnt spend alot of time at the hotel other than for sleeping and getting ready.  We had friends renting Vista Hermosa Villa, only a short walk away from this hotel.  Needless to say, we spend alot of time with them.  The staff were very helpful both at the front desk and the restaurant.  Breakfasts were"
50,"Loved everything about this place. You feel like part of the family when your here. Nothing is too much trouble and as it’s only small you really get to know everyone. I was on a yoga retreat as they have a beautiful rooftop space with stunning views perfect for yoga or a good salsa night! The pool area is so Insta friendly and would make anyone look good. Beautiful big hammocks, a little weights area, some games, gorgeous tent like seared areas. I can’t believe our lunch for the low price. Seriously don’t hesitate to book in. I want to go back next year and I never usually repeat a holiday twice! "
50,"It is hard to put into the words how great unique  and warn and  friendly this place is . I have travelled the world and stayed in many great places and Casa De Olas on the list for sure. The whole place as a unique feel to it and  hard to put into words but you feel like part of the family for sure. The attention to the  details and even small details that make it so special are everywhere you look . My room was well appointed and the bed and linden were great .  The staff also makes  this place very special  I cannot do a enough about their kindness and the way they  look after me . So many highlights love love the location on a quiet street yet steps away from the action,  do miss the food at night the breakfast are  great for sure  but wow the food at night is amazing best"
50,"I really can't recommend beautiful Casa de Olas highly enough; it's such a special place. Great location; good selection of room options depending on if you are travelling solo, as couple, or with a group of friends; amazing team - everyone works hard to ensure you are welcomed, have the info you need, with delicious food and fabulous cocktails!  Very close to the beach, eateries and local shops in La Punta.  Drinking water, coffee and teas available all day.  Already looking forward to my next visit."
50,"Incredible boutique hotel experience! Tucked away on a quiet road, Casa de Olas is a safe heaven only 5 minutes walk from the best beaches and taco spots in town.   Employees are all trustworthy, thoughtful, and friendly!   Accommodations are perfect for a couple or for a fun group of friends! Bring 3-4 of your friends and rent one of the suites to have a beautiful sitting are and kitchen to yourselves.   Amenities are fantastic: the pool, outdoor yoga studio, hammocks, and eating area is perfect for a relaxing week in Mexico.   Highly recommend and intend to go back soon!"
50,"Absolutely the best place to stay with friends or family! Casa de Olas is located 5 min from beautiful beach, local shops and delicious restaurants. All staff is welcome, friendly and ready to help at any time. Rooms are gorgeous and super comfy, left spotless every morning. They serve amazing food and drinks, at the most beautiful swimming pool! Highly recommended."
50,A lovely place to relax and connect to your best self!   At CASA DE OLAS everyone is very friendly and always happy to help you. The beds are super comfortable. Near the beach and local restaurants. Highly recommended!!
50,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff. Stayed here for a yoga retreat and it was a really beautiful location with super friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommend staying here if you are looking to go to puerto escondio."
50,"I spent a marvellous week at Casa de Olas just 2 weeks ago, and I was about to extend my stay but the current worldwide pandemic prevented me from doing that. I went on a yoga retreat and I can honestly say EVERYTHING was perfect. The hotel grounds, its position so close to La Punta beach and little shops, the beautiful rooms full of character, the amazing pool where you could lounge all day, the flamingo theme... it is an Instagram dream! Ironically, because WiFi connection in Mexico isn't very good, you will find not missing your phone at all here, and embracing a much simpler way of life. A special mention has to go to the staff, every single one of them goes above and beyond to make you feel part of the family. Nancy, we all adore you! Nothing is ever too much trouble and"
50,"WOW 🤩. I’ve been visiting Puerto Escondio for 5 Years now and casa De Olas literally is the BEST place in Puerto Escondio to stay. This family run boutique chic hotel has everything you need and honestly the best staff ever. The people here are so nice and go out of their way to help you with anything that you need. The pool and surroundings are 5* , they have bikes , surf boards, skate boards , a tennis court , yoga , salsa nights , boat trips. You name it and Casa De Olas has it !!!! The breakfast is outstanding too and I would never stay anywhere else in Puerto again. I can not recommend this place enough ❤️❤️❤️."
50,"Stayed here during a retreat, they have an amazing pool and the staff is super helpful. It’s placed in la punts which is more the bohemian, hippy part of puerto Escondido but you’re very near to other beaches like zicatela."
50,This hotel is quite remote about thirty five kilometres from the nearest town. Peace and tranquility is what this hotel is about. The bungalows are clean and comfortable and overlook the beach. They all have there own plunge pool and outdoor patio. There is a lovely long swimming pool overlooking the beach as well as cabanas to sit under on the sand. Breakfast and dinner are included in the price of the room. The chef is very inventive and we enjoyed many good meals over our stay. The staff are absolutely wonderful and were a pleasure to talk too. Try the banana Daiquiris there definitely the best I have every had.  We were also treated to some whale watching as we ate our breakfast.
50,"This hotel is amazing!! The location is second to none - on a totally remote and beautiful stretch of beach, with all cabins opening directly onto the beach. The sound of the pacific ocean will lull you to sleep every night. The hotel is thoughtfully designed and with beautiful vistas everywhere you look. You will want to take photos the entire time. The staff are all lovely and so helpful and polite. The food is also very good, although the dinner menu was at times a little restrictive and too ""out there"", with no alternative options for the less adventurous eater. However, that is the only area in which I can fault this amazing hotel. If you live a busy life and really want to get away from it all this is the hotel for you!!!"
50,My girlfriend and I just got back from hotel Escondido. We had the most amazing time! The people were soooo helpful and are some of the nicest we have ever meet in our travels. We recommend it to anyone that wants to just completely relax & be pampered. Extremely  Romantic. #1 or #16 are the best!
50,"While we did not stay at Hotel Escondido, we ate there almost every night.  They have the art of good service down. We rented a house, Casa Tiny, which shares the stretch of the secluded beach and the hotel helps manage.  Our waiter, Antonio, took great care of us and accommodated meals for our 5 year old daughter.   I hope we get another opportunity to visit Puerto Escondido and to stay at the Hotel next time. "
50,"Hotel Escondido offers a beautiful, and rare, opportunity to disconnect. The property is isolated along a very wide stretch of a stunning sandy beach. You can find yourselves alone in the surf at practically any time. The individual palapa-like rooms have practically everything you need to be comfortable. The mood is eco luxury and relaxed, and the service is fine, exactly as you would want. And since the wifi is not good and there's refreshingly not much to do, you can actually disengage and relax. "
40,"We loved this place. The welcome and general demeanour of the staff is relaxed and casual, don't expect a rousing welcome and constant hovering staff. It feels a bit more like they are there to help you out rather than bug you - which is nice for a change.  Once welcomed-ish we were shown to our  lovely room, each has a very comfortable bed with lots of pillows, a private plunge pool and all are on the beach. They are identical I believe so no fomo! You may want to stay further from the main house as it's probably quieter. Sleeping with the  sound of waves crashing on the shore is wonderful.  Wifi was decent if not brilliant, but good enough to get things that need doing done.  The main house is fabulous. A great pool, lots of chill out areas and a vibe that really  encourages"
50,"The Hotel Escondido is the end of the road, sitting on a long, open beach, buy its self.  And I mean alone on the beach.  So be ready.  They have 16 sit alone palapas that are outstanding.  I think they are all the same.  The pool and bar are literally on the beach, built as close to the beach as legally possible I was told.  They are both spectacular.  The food on site is also spectacular and well sourced very locally.  We learned a lot every day from our waiter, Antonio, who was a wealth of local information and took great care of us, with daily, different margarita concoctions that never ceased to amaze, always brought out with remarkable timing for sunset.  After the first day, he quit asking, and just brought us something new.  Excellent .  The only negative I saw was the"
50,"What a great boutique hotel in the middle of nowhere. If you want a few days away from it all to relax on a hammock or in your own pool, come here.  Food is great - every meal was delicious and all staff are super friendly.  Beach is great and the villas are fantastic - large, comfy bed, very funky decor - all 5 star standard.  We also had massages - highly recommend.  Not a whole lot to do around and you are in the middle of nowhere, so if you are there for a few days and are not a massive fan of doing nothing, I'd suggest renting a car. The town is a 25 minutes away and there's very little in between.  I would definitely recommend. It's an awesome little spot."
50,"Removed from the rest of a chaotic world.  Remote from the rest of Puerto Escondido.  Relax in a pristine natural area.  What a beauty.  Spent 4 amazing nights in this simple and peaceful hotel.  Only 16 bungalow make up this property.  Each with a plunge pool.  They also have a large incredible pool towards the main dining area of the hotel.  It wasn't ""more,"" it wasn't ""less.""  Was perfect for what I needed to experience at the time.  Solitude.  Even it was just ideal.  Rooms are perfectly decorated.  All worked well.  Was a very peaceful 4 night of stars, quiet, and time to reflect. Rooms all offer a beautiful view of the sea.  Landscaped to blend in with the environment.  Very low key.  Nothing is around you-  nothing.  No other hotel, restaurant, stores, etc.,   Loved it.  "
50,"This hotel is unique. The location, its long infinity pool, the beach, the waves, nature, vegetation. It is just the perfect place to relax with your partner and have a romantic getaway. The service is top-notch and the food was excellent. We rented a car but did not leave the hotel once. You dont need to go out. Just go and enjoy!"
50,"I had planned to stay 2 nights in Hotelito Swiss Oasis, but ended up spending 7, as I liked the place so much. The Hotelito is small (I think 10 rooms), with very nice, spacious, clean rooms. There is a pool, a lot of cats and a short waking distance to the beach. The Swiss owners are very nice and helpful. I would definitely stay there again if I went back!"
50,"Safe, beautiful & quiet. The hosts are very nice, helpful/speak English.   They take such great care of their little oasis because they live here too. So every morning they sweep leaves, and keep the grounds beautiful.   The placement of the hotelito is in the center of the Zicatela beach. So you can walk either way and find restaurants, drinks, bars, shops. Super centrally located.   The most important thing for me with regard to this place is Manuela cares about the quality of her guests and her little oasis. It is quiet and people are respectful and friendly. You will feel safe and can have restful sleep here.   I don't think we could have found any better quality place for the same cost. They are fairly priced and decent people with a great honor system. I love that.   It's"
40,"The lodging is in a great location, the price was fine, and the room/ grounds are very clean and the owners really care in this regard.   If you are non-smokers, you should be aware that the rooms do not have windows only insect screens.  One night our neighbors had a smoke - a - thon downstairs and we got to smell it in our room.  Also if you are light sleepers the lack of a window can be an issue. One night we were there a party was going on at the hotel next to us until about 8am and there was no blocking out the noise.  I would rank this hotel a little lower than 4/5 due to the owners allowing smoking in the courtyard near the rooms, and the communications issues we had with the owner (Merriam Webster definition of ""through"" is: during the entire period of) ."
50,"Hotelito Swiss Oasis is very nice and clean with a beautiful swimming pool, it's very close to Zicatela beach. Rooms are perfectly clean, there is a big fridge where you can take what you want paying at the check out with correct price and the owners are very kind and available."
50,The perfect Hotelito to stay in Puerto Escondido. So relaxing by the pool. Moments from Zicatela beach and the mexican pipeline. The owners are so friendly and helpful. They had a great contact for surf lessons. Lots of great places to eat nearby. 
50,"My girlfriend and I first stayed at the Swiss Oasis back in 2012. From the beginning of our stay we were saying we'd love to come back - so we did, first in 2014 and now again in 2015, so I thought it was about time I wrote how much we love it.   First thing that comes to mind are the owners. Manuela is without a doubt one of the best hosts of any guesthouse I've ever been to, and we've traveled a lot. She's always warm and welcoming to everyone and I honestly felt like part of the Oasis family from the beginning. I think this is the main reason we kept coming back. She's always around for help with the local area or information like what a taxi should cost etc, even phone calls to tour operators at no charge! This really takes the stress out of the vacation.   Next is the"
20,"Hello everybody,  We didn't have a terrible experience at Swiss Oasis, but I have a hard time seeing how it could be #3 on trip advisor. really? A few annoying attributes: coming back to a not-cleaned room, only having hand soap to shower with, slow internet and so on. The rooms also have a kind of strange feel to them, with old towels and sheets like at 'grandmas house'. I'm not trying to poo-poo this place beyond reason. The beer-fridge honor system was cool. But value for money? Debatable."
50,"This small hotel that is just off the main Boulevard in Playa Zicatela, Puerto Escondido is a travelers dream.  Quiet, secure, friendly, clean, and close to all sevices.  Can't go wrong here.  A wonderful little tropical paradise hotel that exudes relaxation."
50,"What a lovely stay! Fiona made each day just that extra bit more special by recommending different beaches and which wonderful restaurants to eat at. Our room was so very clean and the young lady who came to clean, cheerful and kind. On top of that the place is visually beautiful. Flowers are everywhere. It was nice to take refuge from the hot beach back on our little porch or by lying in one of the many hammocks spread around the property. Finally it was also economic. I think most importantly, though, is the kindness which pervades this place. I'll be back,"
50,"Hy husband and I were coming from Oaxaca, Mexico to Puerto Escondido for a little R & R at the Pacific Coast for 5 days.  I had read about Hotelito Swiss Oasis and decided to check it out.  It was so boutique, simple, but colorful.  the owner was very accomodating, but not always around, which was good.  There is a kitchen that you can store you food in a refrigerator, with sink, plates and cooking utensils.  The pool was quite the ticket as the days were very hot and humid.  We had a lovely room upstairs that would easily sleep 5,  we had enough fans to keep us cool at night. It was less than 1/2 block to the beach, food and taxis.  Great location, great price, excellent services and ammenities.  Would definitely go there again."
50,"We stayed here for 5 nights for our honeymoon. Our first trip to Mexico, and villa Lilli exceeded our expectations. Amazing home cooked mexican breakfast every morning was divine! The owners even drove us down to playa zicatela so we could go for a surf. They are all so friendly and accommodating. The premises always kept clean and very safe. I would defiantly recommend this property to anyone who visits puerto, we will be back, eventually! Thankyou so much! We were a little late writing this , but never forgot our amazing 5 days with you all. Tanya and Owen Sullivan."
50,"As a family of four, we could not have landed at a better place for our six days in Puerto Escondido.  The family who runs Villa Lilli is fantastic and so welcoming.  The breakfasts were delicious and catered to everyones' specific food preferences.  The room was very comfortable and had a great view.  Claire was a huge help in setting up things to do and explore in the area. We loved swimming in the pools at Villa LIlli and enjoyed the quick walk to several different beaches nearby.  Close to many restaurants and other shops.  As evidenced by the consistent 5 star rating, Villa Lilli is the best place to stay in PE!!"
50,"Stumbled into Villa Lili after a grueling eight hour motorcycle ride down from Oaxaca and was greeted with the friendliness of family. Claire, Luis, Francesco, Sylvia and Magdalen treat you like one of their own and feed you and take care of you with immense care. Could not have expected more. Great comfortable room, great breakfasts, and close proximity to everything."
50,"We spent ten nights at Villa Lili and had a beautifully relaxing time. The owner Claire is the most helpful, kind and friendly person you could ask for, and she really made an effort to make our stay memorable. She even bought us a birthday cake!!! Like everyone says, the breakfasts are incredible and we only ate twice a day because they were so filling. You won't regret a stay at this wonderful hotel in this magical place. "
50,"We traveled as a couple and stayed here for 2 nights in the room on the highest floor - no balcony but offered a stunning view of the beach. Wished we could stay longer. Adelina, the owner, is amazing and was always willing to have breakfast with us and teach us about Mexico's culture, politics, etc. Irene's traditional home-cooked food is delicious! We hope to return some day! Whether you are travelling as a couple, solo or with a family/friends, this place will suite your needs!"
50,"Words cannot express how amazing and incredible our time was at the Villa Lili.  We have traveled to many locations and stayed in may hotels and B&B's around the world, and the Villa Lili blows each and every one away.  My girlfriend and I stayed at the Villa Lili in the fall of 2010.  We were coming to Puerto Escondido for 3 months, but originally booked our stay here for one week to look at different hotels in the area.  It didn't take long for us to decide that we already were in the best place in Puerto and we would be staying at the Villa Lili for the entire 3 months.  The owners and staff were truly amazing.  They treated us and everyone who stayed there, even if for only a night or two, like family.  They would always go out of their way to make their guests truly enjoy"
50,"We had intended on staying for 2 days and ended up staying for 7! Irene's traditional home cooked breakfasts provided us with the freshest and tastiest culinary experiences of our entire mexican trip (the coconut prawn tacos a personal fave of mine). The rooms were beautiful and Claire and Louis went far above and beyond their call of duty to provide a warm, friendly and helpful environment. We cannot recommend Villa Lily highly enough and we hope to return some day!  Lucy&Nick"
50,"Had a wonderful trip again to PE! Such a great beach location ....5 minute walk from Playa Carrizalillo and the best part is the staff! Adelina, Claire, Luis and Irene really know how to take care of their guests. They take a real interest in understanding their guests interests, then assist in getting the activities lined up. Their hospitality is some of the best I've experienced!  Love PE for the many varied activities: great surfing, wonderful surf instructors from Oasis! Bioluminescence at the lagoon at night is amazing....also the visit to the turtles and releasing to the ocean! Made a trip to the waterfalls which was so interesting and beautiful. Love the temescal and massage from Alejandro at Temecali -amazing experience!   Great food throughout PE! The best is the"
50,"We couldn't have found anywhere better than Villa Lili for our long weekend at the beach. I had chosen the hotel based on the positive reviews online, and all my expectations were met. Our room was spacious and comfortable - despite three of us sharing, it never felt cramped. I was initially worried that it would be too hot without an air conditioning unit but the fans and open windows (with mosquito screens) did a great job and we were always comfortable.  The facilities were first-rate. The wifi connection worked without any problems. The pools (plural!) were great - ideal for those times when the beach was busy or we wanted to be a bit quieter. The breakfast was delicious - possibly the best mango I've eaten in Mexico, and excellent hot dishes too. We really appreciated the"
50,"We really enjoyed the hotel but the best part by far was the breakfast. Irene was amazing!  We always looked forward to the hot mexican meal!!! I hope you guys open a restaurant.   We also really enjoyed Luis and Clare taking the time to give us advise for activities. They gave us the occasional ride around town, too.  We loved surfing, watching the huge waves, took spanish classes, saw dolphins, turtles and the mangroves.  We can't wait to go back."
40,Very delicious. Beautifully plated. Serene garden setting. Not guests of the hotel...couldn't resist and we felt very welcome! Coffee so good you must have second cup. Huevos  Mexicana better than many
50,"Our experience at Villa Mozart y Macondo was nothing but excellent. Manfred and Angie are wonderful hosts, and the breakfasts were some of the best food we had in Puerto Escondido.   They helped us to book flights to Mexico City, and were very knowledgeable in terms of which days the airlines fly and which were the best value. The guest house itself is very cool, and reflects the ownerships' quirky and arty personalities. We spent three days in one of the bungalows, and after exploring the little town felt lucky that Playa Carrizalillo is by far the most beautiful and least commercial beach in town, and the restaurants/cafes in the strip mall right next to the hotel were better than any other we tried.   Great value, wonderful hosts and perfect location."
50,"We were lucky enough to spend around 10 days in the bungalow, and we had such a wonderful experience.  It's located in a very quiet and beautiful part of Puerto Escondito, and the bungalow was beautiful and big and clean and so tastefully decorated.  We loved Manfred and Angie, and it was a pleasure getting to know them a bit and sharing stories.  I would go back again in a heartbeat...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
50,"I haven't stayed in the rooms at the Villa but I have seen them and they look fabulous, super clean and wonderful decorations. But they are also open for breakfast even if you aren't staying there and this is a great place to go.  The food is really good and the breakfast area is in their gorgeous garden.  Lots of plants, secluded, quiet and really close to Playa Carrizalillo if you want to go check out the surfers."
50,"We were recommended the Villa Motzart by friends in who live in Cholula MX. They too stayed in the villa an spoke of the place and owners so highly we decided to come and enjoy the experience as well.   The villa is VERY clean and the owners are extreamely helpful. The owners have suggestions and ways to help to arrange outside trips (eco tours, horseback ridding, fishing/boat trips, etc). The rooms are reasonable price, especially if you take account of the indoor and door living space.  There is a beautiful garden in the back with many areas to dine and relax.   Some of the rooms are like a home away from home with a separate kitchen, living room and bedroom. We took advantage of the kitchen to cook with the local foods.   The block that the villa sits on is a jewel  for great"
50,"I loved staying in Villa Mozart y Macondo.  We were lucky enough to get the bungalow the first few nights - Highly recomended!  Villa Mozart is set in a really peaceful location in Playa Cazarilllio, a beautiful little surf beach, with a few beach cafes. It is situated just outside Puerto Escondido centre, but as it´s 20 Pesos anywhere in a taxi in PE, only US$2, so no worries there.  We slept beautifully each night, and in the mornings we were served a delicious, freshly prepared breakfast, by the lovely Angie in the garden cafe - outdoors.   I loved the garden, and want to recreate it at home in England, no chance of that then.  Manfred and Angie take great care of the garden, and there are Objets Trouve`, such and old hulled wooden boat, which my son aged 4, just loved."
50,"Manfred and Angie are so warm and welcoming, and the place is so charming and clean. Also, the closest beach is the nicest one in PE.   We are also enjoying all of the great cafes and restaurants at this end of town! Highly recommend this place to stay...you will instantly relax."
50,"Manfred and Agelica are center to this beautiful and pleasant villa. They have put so much of their love of nature and art into this comfortable hotel. You will consider yourself lucky to stay here but don't make it too short. As a few days go by you find youself within less than 5 minutes strole to Carrizalillo Beach with plenty of shade and service, along with many shops and restrauants along the main street in front. Their own garden/coffee and tea patio is always friendly and shady not to mention a lovely work of art itself and a great place to start your day with coffee and breakfast. Luz, their lovely assistant, will see to it you have all you want. Their suites are not only top quality but so much has been added in an artistic way and that really adds to the wonderful"
50,"It was truly a very enjoyable stay. Angie and Manfred are incredible host! We stayed in the suite in the third floor. Quiet, peaceful, and tranquil. Wifi access so you can take your laptop if you need to work. Very nice artwork in the rooms by regional artist.  Do make sure you eat breakfast in the hotel since it is very good  Organic coffee from a nearby coffee farm, homemade teas made by Angie (my friend and I had some ailments and Angie knew what tea to make for each of us), delicious sunny side up eggs/chillaquiles made by Luz, homemade bread from a local source, honey and agave locally grown in the region. The beach called Carrilazillo is 5 minutes walking distance and another one is 10 minutes away. It takes only five minutes in cab to go to the other beaches and the"
40,"We came from New York, really hoping to find a relaxing place to spend time with each other. There are several nice places in PE, but we were very happy at Villa Mozart. The praise is all true. Manfred and Angie are so kind, their prices reasonable, and they've built their place with a real sense of beauty and peacefulness. The garden is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen, created by Angie with a stunning collection of plants and artifacts, and you can have breakfast there and hang at your leisure. Also, the breakfasts there, cooked by Lucy and Angie, are handmade and were the best meals we've had by far in PE. (Try Lucy's sopes, people!) Midweek I got a small infection from a cut, and Manfred drove me to a local clinic, translated and stayed with me while I was treated,"
50,"I wish I could have stayed longer here. It was literally perfect for me. I stayed in four different places during my holiday in Mexico and this one was my favourite, despite the stiff competition. The accommodation itself is lovely, clean bright rooms, excellent showers, wonderful pool and an amazing breakfast. But the key feature of this place was Adelina, who runs it with her brother and  Magdalena the lady who cooks breakfast and is on site until 4 each day. Together they provide an incredibly personable service which is at the same time professional yet relaxed based on honesty and trust. I think a lot of people who run hotels could learn a lot from the Adelina and her team at Quinta lili.  "
50,"Ade, her brother Luis and their staff made my weekend an amazing part of my trip to Mexico.   Starting by arranging the pickup and drop off at the airport, the friendly, welcoming and great tips and advise about what/where to go and try. Last and not least, the best breakfast you can get in (on my last day they made Mole!!!).  The hotel is small (4-5 rooms) and I will say mainly focused on couples/groups at friends. You can use the kitchen freely, and the ""honor"" based bar is very convenient.   I've recommended it to my friends, and will be back at Quinta on my next trip to Puerto. "
50,"Quinta Lili is not a hotel!  It's so much more!  It's like staying at your best friend's summer home.  My husband and I stayed in the 2nd floor ""suite"".  From the comfort of our bed, the lounge chairs on the second level of the room, or the outside hot tub, the view was of palm trees, ocean, and the setting sun. Adelina, the host, is crazy full of energy.  She's an adorable young woman every ready to assist, educate, recommend, and laugh.  You could not ask for   a more attentive staff. The property is super clean and the soft music playing in the pool area created a tranquil atmosphere.   This was our second trip to Puerto.  There WILL be a third but this time we'll return to Quinta Lili."
50,"Had a very nice stay at the Quinta Lili. They had an excellent home cooked breakfast every morning and were very helpfull and accomodating during our stay. Close to the nice private beach, and a 3 dollar taxi ride to most every other place. Liked the privacy and quiet."
50,"The place is awsome. Adelina, the host, is very friendly, helps with all the questions, always helpful. Breakfast they serve is very tasty. Thanks to Adelina we've visited places that would not visit on our own. Definitely worth spending time in Quinta Lili. Mi and my husband had wonderful time there.  Marija from Lithuania"
50,"We stayed here for 3 nights. Adelina (the owner) & Magdalena (who cooks the most amazing food) were so warm and friendly and gave us loads of great ideas about what to see and do during our stay in Mexico. The rooms are beautiful, (as is the whole place) very clean, serene and spacious and its very quiet. There were 6 rooms but sometimes we felt that we were the only guests. It was perfect just lounging by the pool and getting some R&R. We felt very relaxed here and made to feel very welcome. The nearest beach is the very beautiful playa Carrizalillo which is only a 10-15 minute walk away. I couldn't recommend this place more highly of you are looking to stay in the Puerto Escondido area. Adelina recommended we released the newly hatched baby turtles into the sea and it was a"
50,"Beautiful, intimate, homey - these are the words which exactly define this wonderful place! The rooms are lovely and very comfortable.The hotel is located in a quiet area and  close to the beach. We'll come back for sure!"
50,The Excellent review says it all. This was the perfect place to stay. Not a thing I would change other than I wish we could have stayed longer. Ade is just about the nicest and most accommodating person I have ever met. The food is delicious. The vibe is so mellow and relaxing. The rooms are perfect. The price is right. The location is excellent. There is really no reason to even consider staying anywhere else. Just book it.
50,"There are many wonderful places to stay in the world, but few made such an impression as Quinta Lili! It all started with checking Tripadvisor, and seeing the overwhelming dominance there, i sent them an email. Luis was quick to respond, and helpful with descriptions of rooms, availability, and prices. Then fast-forward to arrival, taxi to the hotel and a wonderful weekend getaway starts. The hotel itself is small, cozy, and charming. Soft music always plays in the background, pool is great, plenty of comfy places to relax.. The breakfast requires a special mentioning, prepared fresh daily in the best traditions of mexican cousine. But without a doubt, the best part is the staff, led by the wonderful Adelina!! It's amazing how much kindness and helpfulness she projects! She"
50,"Quinta Lilli is a cosy boutique hotel in the middle of the paradise. Ideal place for people who appreciate intimacy, calmness and family atmosphere. The rooms are spacious and very tidy. Every day we had fresh towels (towels for the beach or swimming pool are also provided). Quinta Lilli is very good located - only five minute walk from the beautiful beach and nice restaurants. We stayed in Quinta Lilly for 7 nights and every day was different, always very tasty breakfast – based on local cuisine. Fresh fruits are severed every day. Adelina - the owner is very friendly and helpful person – full of energy and involvement. She is helping to arrange trips and tourist attraction such as releasing to the ocean newborn turtles or boat trips to admire dolphins or birds. She also is"
50,I stay for a week in the Surf House. The location is great and it only takes about 2 minutes to the beach. The lessons with David were very good. I really enjoyed this place and will definitely come back.
50,"I had the luck of spending 5 nights at PuertoSurf.com.mx and loved my stay. David and Swantje were wonderful hosts and their kids are just charming. The place is not huge which is what I was looking for to be able to relax and have some time to myself. Not far from the hotel are a couple of restaurants and if you want more eating choices just grab a cab on the corner of the street for 30 pesos and head to Zicatela were there's more action. I also had the chance to take surfing lessons from David who's a very patient, friendly and encouraging instructor. After one lesson I was able to stand up for a brief time, but after the second I was able to ride the whole wave. I couldn't have been happier. During my stay I met another person who was on his 2nd stay at Puerto Surf and I was"
50,very nice place big rooms very clean and pretty much sterile haha big pool garden nice staff friendly great location
50,"Although the house is really small (there are only two rooms), it was a great stay! David, the owner, is really friendly and a great surf teacher. Loads of patience and always having a smile on the face. The rooms are clean and you have your own bed. The only negative point is the shower where I had to jump after the jet of water. Maybe decalcing it would help :-)  It's a self catering home, so there's a fridge, stove and everything you need. Some steps away from the house, you will find the empty beach of La Punta. If you want to eat, there are about 4 restaurants in la punta, otherwise you can take a taxi (very easy to find) to the town. With 35$ (pesos to be well understood), it will take you everywhere in town. I would always go back here, can only recommend it!"
50,"Very nice and clean rooms, beatyful garden and it just takes you something like 100 steps to reach the beach. Perfect for couples or people who like it calm and easy!!!"
50,"David and Swantje Salinas surf house is your best choice if you want to have calm rest, best personal surf lessons and nice people to talk while you have rest in hammock) amenities include great outdoor kitchen, shower, fan, cute rooms. We've took a long way to get to Puerto and met true hospitality in this family's house and definitely will be back again! Veronika & Yuriy."
50,"The house and the location are magical, and the surfing is awesome. Everyone is extremely friendly, and I felt extremely sad when it came time to leave. I highly recommend it."
50,"I found out about David Salinas thanks to a commenter on wannasurf.com.  What fantastic luck that was.   There are tons of surf instructors in Puerto Escondido, and I have been in the water alongside many of them.  But no instructor is quite like David.    Surfing is a difficult activity.  It takes a healthy amount of time, practice, and repetition to get good at it.   A lot of it is timing--and combining an ability to read incoming waves with proper positioning in the lineup.  And etiquette!  Not being a jerk in the water.  Not dropping in on folks, staying out of trouble.  Not going after waves that might hurt you... et cetera.  David's instruction allows a perfect newbie at surfing the ability to read, paddle for, and ride waves.  He goes over all the major topics: "
50,"If you are looking for a great holiday, do not miss the Surf House in Puerto Escondido. I can most warmly recommend the location, atmosphere and the surf classes. Don't miss the thai massage!!"
50,"We stayed at a resort in Huatulco for a week before we made it to Puerto, and the latter was by far the highlight of the trip. David and Swantje are very hospitable and accommodating. We definitely improved our surfing skills. We will return and recommend our friends and family."
50,"The location on top of the cliffs above playa carrizalillo is just outstanding. The accomodation (la teraza) had a large teraza and just all the comfort we could ask for. And it was all spotless clean and all in excellent technical condition.  The playa carrizalillo is one of the few spots with good swimming, good learning conditions for surfing beginners and also non-dangerous sandy beach conditions for small children. I havn´t come across this blend so far.  I enjoyed the week with my teenage son to whom the mix of surf lessons, snorkling, chilling at the beach and the WIFI around the hotel was perfect, too !  The restaurant is excellent with a stunning view to the carrizalillo bay.  The staff at the hotel reception was outstanding helpful.  There are most probably more"
40,"My husband and I spent 4 nights Villas Carrizalillo, getting to know Puerto Escondido for the first time. The hotel's location is superb, nestled on the top of the hill overlooking the Carrizalillo Beach. Another plus is the restaurant right in the hotel, every meal was good with a sweeping view of the Carrizalillo Bay. We stayed in the Villa Escondido, which is the one closest to the stairs accessing the beach, and again fantastic views. The bed was comfortable enough (I would have preferred a softer mattress), but the villa is like a small cave , with plenty of space, a good bathroom and little kitchenette with a small fridge to keep snacks and beverages. Besides an upgrade on the mattress, the only other upgrade I would recommend would be to the shower head which spurted"
50,"Beautiful smaller hotel with one of the best beaches ever! Our room was luxurious, large and comfortable with a great porch overlooking the beach. The restaurant was really good too. The bed was very comfortable with nice linens. A bonus was a kitchenette. This hotel had lovely landscaping with small terraces and great views."
50,"The pictures do not do Villa Carrizalillo justice - it is simply breathtaking! Before I arrived, I was a little nervous about the previous reviewers' comments about the staircase leading down to the beach. If you are of average fitness it's no big deal at all - the stairs are well maintained. It's actually divine staying above the beach - when it gets too hot you can retreat to your deck and watch the beach from above. It was actually much better than staying on the beach level because of the amazing view!  My family stayed in three villas for 3 nights - Pueblo, Escondito and Terrazada. They were all clean, spacious and comfortable. The terrace room is fantastic if you are with a group.   My family ate most meals at the restaurant and everything was delicious. The pancakes were"
50,"I stayed here beginning of March for a week.  I was travelling alone and decided to splurge on this gem.  I have never been happier.  This hotel has it's own entrance to the best beach in Puerto Escondido.  The view from my room of the beach and ocean was nothing less than spectacular.  Every room as a luxurious out door lounge area.  My room, Escondido, incorporated the cliff rock into the walls. Luxurious bathrooms and lovely kitchens.  Now that I think about it, best hotel I've stayed in.  Will definitely be back."
50,"Had a great stay here in Oct and just went back on a quick stop over for lunch. The staff was amazing and the restaurant on the property, Espadin, is one of the best in the area. The beach is great for both swimming and surfing. The stairway to walk there is steep but not impossible. Rooms are spacious and the kitchen and AC works well. Kid friendly.  The kind staff really make this place even better. "
50,"returned last month from 2 weeks at Villa Carazalillo....have been going there for almost 20 yrs...it is the absolute best, great rooms, great views. great resturant, friendly staff., reasonable prices..i love the place"
40,"The hotel is beautiful, super clean, and the staff is friendly.  The beach is great for swimming and relaxing but it is public and if you want covered or seating area you need to consume a minimum amount in any of the local restaurants (which isn't bad since they do have yummy food, cold beers and drinks).  The stairs to the beach though are a pain... some are uneven, and extremely steep, so be careful.  We ate at the restaurant three times, the food was decent the first time, but the second (New Years Eve dinner) and third were not too impressive (and made some of us sick). There was a couple of incidents with one extremely rude waiter who screamed, and then ignored some members of our party. We complained twice, but nothing was done about it.  As I understand it the restaurant"
40,"My husband and I spent 8 days at Villas Carrizalillo this past October.  The location couldn't be better..about 100 steps above the beautiful bay of Playa Carrizalillo . A beautiful beach for swimming and surfing lessons.  We stayed in the Mitla Villa which was nice, plenty of room, although I think it could use some refurbishing.  The restaurant on the property is outstanding with incredible views of the bay.  All in all, I think this is the best property in Puerto Escondido."
40,"The location is amazing, AC in all rooms (stayed in two cabins) restaurant sits on top on the hill overlooking the bay.  Access to the beach via stairway, beach is clean and service is great.  Free parking."
50,"I really adored this place. The owner and the staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating without being overbearing. The rooms are all decorated with a ton of love -- especially loved the bathroom and shower tiles. Loved the kitchenette. The hotel is about a block from the beach, at a quieter spot in puerto escondido. Would stay here again"
50,"Our stay in the hotel was the best we had over the last years. The garden is beautiful, the apartments individually and the staff is friendly and helpful. Our three children (4, 8 and 10 years) loved the pool and the short distance to the ocean. And we as parents enjoyed the yoga classes in the morning.  We were very glad to be invited to the meet and greet on the terrace of the owner. We were treated like family members and we will definitely return soon."
10,"The room was very dirty, hairs and dead spiders in the shower and under the bed. Stains on the sheets. Stains in the sink. Dust (cow-webs) on the roof. And it was small ants all over the kitchen. We tried to say something to the cleaner, but she did nothing. Only asked for tips.And who tips for a cleaner that dosent clean. When we left the room i forgot my charger and adapter.When I asked for it later it was gone... so someone in that hotel just took it... I traveld all over Mexico for some weeks and this hotel was the only bad experience I had in Mexico"
50,"We spend 4 nights in Casamar suits and its one of the best places to stay in Mexico.  first of all, the place itself is beautiful. the garden and the pool are really nice and the atmosphere in the place is peaceful. the rooms are really big, packed with local art and well equipped.    the staff are very nice and helpful. every question or request get answers immediately.   this place as a lot to offer beside a place to sleep: yoga classes (for free) meet and greet with the owner and  other guests, and so on.   this place really got a family vibe.   definitely will come again. "
50,"I stayed at Casamar Suites for 3 weeks in August 2016.  I had the most amazing time there and plan to go back.  The rooms were immaculate and equipped with everything you need. The choice of decor was tasteful and authentic to Mexico. If you choose to buy food there, it is very reasonably priced and home cooked.  The food I ordered, was very tasty and fresh. The pool is very clean and a good size to swim laps in. As a solo female traveller, I felt safe.  It's located near the beach and also near some restaurants.   This was my first time in Mexico and the owners gave me advice about where to eat in town and what to see in the local area. I would definitely recommend this Hotel to my friends and family.  It was a joy to stay there and the staff and owners are lovely. "
50,"Stayed the month here with my daughter in the summer. I was looking for a quite place by the beach, and got that, plus a lot more. Our suite was great and had everything we needed. The grounds were kept in great order, but the best part about the hotel were the people. Everyone at the hotel was super friendly and always willing to go out of their way to help. It was the staff that really made my stay enjoyable. In addition to that, the location worked out great for us. I was out of the way enough to have a quiet stay, but also was super close to the beach, within walking distance to corner stores and restaurants, and a quite cab ride away from some of the more busier parts of the city. I highly recommend staying here...the quality for the price is unbeatable. "
50,"We have stayed there many times now, every time we go to Puerto. It's very quiet, a great place to relax and very safe! I love that every room has a kitchen so we can prepare some food but also their menu is super yummy and not expensive at all. We love their free coffee every morning too. I would only suggest that they improve their wifi. "
40,"Beautiful gardens. peaceful surrounds, clean rooms and lovely pool. Had a lovely week stay with helpful and friendly staff. Close enough to walk to beach and restaurants at La Punta or 20 min walk to Zicatela main beach."
50,"Loved the peacefulness and the friendliness of everyone. Will was an excellent host, so welcoming. Loved the Monday afternoon sunset get-together. Met fascinating people. Our room was spacious and clean. Having a kitchen was a real plus. Also, the pool was not chlorinated, which was wonderful - watched the birds zip by for a drink. Lovely, well-kept garden, and a very secure place to park our car. "
40,"Casamar Suites is located about a 30 peso ride from the action in Puerto Escondido. It is a quiet, private apartment compound with security. The grounds are beautiful, the kitchens fully equipped with all utensils and bottled water for cooking and drinking. The bed and bath are as nice as any I've encounter. The swimming pool is refreshing, though at the time I was there, there were some children who were guests of the owner were quite loud. I'm not sure if this is really a place for young ones as there is nothing to do but swim and relax. Travel to Puerto is necessary for entertainment. All in all, Casamar is a very safe, quiet, attractive place to spend your vacation. The beach is just down the street, but it is remote and undeveloped. There are small restaurants and shops"
50,"Our unit was on the third floor directly on the beach. They provuded us a 4 bedroom with a massive patio the unit was very spacious and well equipped. We typically prefer staying in condos to insure we have better amenities in the rooms including washer and dryer as well as a living area to give everyone space.  The only pitfall was the huge patio only had a table with 6 chairs ( without cushions)  no loungers or additional comfortable seating areas. The restaurant, lounge and pool bar was exceptional and the service was very good at all areas.  The beach is endless although the waves could be massive some days lifeguards are on duty.  We enjoyed the pools with the infinity edge and swim up bar and the water temperature was perfect for the weather refreshing but not an ice bath"
50,Loved every bit of our vacation. Resort was clean and beautiful. Between the ocean and the pools the kids loved it too. Food was great and the service was better. We felt safe wherever we went as we ventured to town.
50,"We had an amazing time!  Really loved the location of the resort and loved the endless beach.  We went on the discovery tour to see if this is something for us when we retire. Well, we are hooked. Loved everything about it and now we have a goal to work towards ."
40,We had a good time at Vivo Resort. It's great to visit this resort if you want a calm and peacefull place. Good food at the restaurant at good prices. The air conditioning of one of the rooms did not work well.
50,I expend one week with my family and the place was beautiful. We rent a 3 bedroom condo and we were very comfortable and we cook some days and the restaurant was great and unexpansive. Good quality amenities and extraordinary service and very kind and friendly.
50,"We rented a one bedroom condo for the last week of March 2018. After staying at all inclusives before this was a nice break from all the people!  No grabbing chairs, lining up for food, or hoping to find a place on the beach.  Lots of room, slow pace, great service, exquisite accommodations.  We ate both breakfast and dinner at the restaurant everyday, charged drinks at the swim up bar and charged at the store... at the end of the week our tab was about $6000 pesos.... very very reasonable for all we had.  Beach is untouched - no vendors, no people. Beautiful and serene for miles.  Amazing weather, friendly people, really looking forward to going back as it will only get better as they continue to develop."
30,"This resort could be a top resort but their operation were terrible - they screwed up both airport transfers, there were problems with the room, there was no explanation of the resort services available and worst of all the individual at the front desk was rude and insolent in a way I have never experienced in travels around the world."
40,We were there for a week and had a great time. Recommend the sea turtles!  The pools are also nice to relax in or play volleyball.  Staff was very friendly.  The store was often out of eggs and milk but we were able to get milk from the bar for our toddler.
30,"The resort is lovely and the condo was very nice, extremely spacious and a fantastic deck. Coffee was suppose do be supplied, which we didn't know until we went to buy some at the little store. Nice for us that they asked us if there wasn't already coffee in the suite, when we replied no, they just gave us some. Very nice to have a little store that had a good selection of snacks, basics and drinks. It really is in the middle of nowhere, miles from the town. So perfect if all you want to do is hang out in a resort otherwise not really convenient. My husband was quite sick when we got here, not sure what his problem was but he really needed to recover and rest. I couldn't believe it when workers started hammering and drilling early Sunday morning and it just went on and on. At"
40,"Although the rental apartment was very nice, clean and spacious, there were some shortcomings. Short supply of coffee filters, dishwashing liquid and laundry soap. I had to get maintenance in for a TV reset and washer/dryer GFI reset. Cleaning staff was great. Definite lack of things to do."
50,This really is a fabulous hotel and priced just right. Recommended by the owner of the Hotel Las Azucenas in Oaxaca (another fabulous spot)my only regret is not being able to stay longer. The restaurant alone is worth the trip! 
50,"We did a LOT of research before taking this trip, and looked at every hotel on this list, and can say, for sure, that we made the RIGHT selection. Perfect location, wonderful staff, very accomodating...can't say enough good things. We travel a lot and would rank this as one of our favorite hotels to date. Thanks for a great vacation!!! "
40,"My wife and I just returned from a 4 night stay at Flor de Maria and there's no where else in its price range I'd recommend. In our time in the Puerto area, we had the opportunity to walk the beaches and touristy areas and Flor is in a quiet spot on a sandy road between the two major tourist areas of Zicatela and the Adoquin. Both are easy walks down the beaches on foot. Samuel at the front desk is a gem and was irreplaceable for us. Across the road from Flor is a mini mart with cheap soft drinks and beers. At the end of the road about 200 meters from Flor is the beachfront with a palapa bar and boogie board rentals for 20 pesos/hour. At the time we were there, the best boarding was at about 4:30 PM. Our room was warm in the afternoon, but cooled in the evenings. The ceiling fan"
40,We spent 2 nights in Paraiso Escondido and had a great time! The staff was very helpfull and the room was clean and cool. Great value for money!
50,"We just returned from a wonderful stay with Paul and Joanne at the Hotel Flor de Maria....Soft ocean breezes, Sam's most excellent cocktails on the upper deck, the best meals on the coast.  We jokingly called Paul ""Doctor"", as we felt we had checked into a retreat for peace, quiet, swimming, reading, and happiness....hated to check out.  All in all, a wonderful quiet place and an excellent bargain. Very helpful and considerate hosts...gracias! "
50,"My husband and I just spent four days at the Hotel Flor de Maria in Puerto Escondido, and fell in love with it.  The rooms are very basic, but the hotel is artistically decorated and wonderful, but it's the pool and hammocks on the rooftop that are the best.  In the heat of the afternoon, we lazed away having drinks, watching the ocean and listening to the surf.  The only downside was that once some guests got a hammock, they never let it go, and there were only five hammocks to share. When booking this hotel, I hadn't realized it was quite so close to the beach, so this was a very pleasant surprise. The owners, Paul and Joanne, are helpful and go out of their way to make sure you know how to get around town, know of the various tour options and will even make the reservations"
50,"I literally stayed at the FDM 2 years ago and I think about it all of the time.  It is gorgeous, the owners amazingly helpful (we did not find them stand-offish in the least), and so relaxing.  I would return in a heartbeat and have sent everyone going to PE there.  Just one word of caution... I nearly drowned at the beach boogie-boarding in July.  Be very careful, my gringa swimming non-skills nearly cost me my life!  But at least I had the wonderful FDM to come back to! The place across the dirt road IS amazing for breakfast, as another review also said.  The french toast or fruit and granola was amazing, the staff slendid! I miss Mexico! "
40,"We loved the hotel, it  was very clean and the view that we got was awesome. Actually There is only one room that has a little balcony and we got it ;) The restaurant was very good and totally inexpensive. The Canadian owners were very helpful and polite. The pool is the best!! Located on the roof of the 3 story hotel, has a great view of the beach Marinero and the hills behind Bahía Principal. There is like 5 hamocks next to the pool and underneath a palapa were you can relax and read a book or just take a peaceful nap.   The few downsides about the hotel were that there is not air conditioner, so it was extremely warm at night and even with the ceiling fan we were sweating a lot. Because we had lo leave the windows open to get some air current circulating we could hear all the"
50,"We just arrived from Mexico (August 14th). We spent 11 days at the Flor de Maria. We went with 3 kids and we have not ONE complain!! The food is excellent! Every night a different choice (HOMEMADE!! with fresh products from the market!). The hotel not only is CLEAN, it smells clean too!! The staff is friendly and always ready to help. THe owners make you feel at home and share tips about beaches and restaurants (YES! Even if they have a restaurant there they don't mind sharing with you who/where the other restaurantes are!). THe hotel in itself is an exposition of art... tasteful pictures painted on the walls, colorful columns decorating the interior patio.  On the top there is a little but very (VERY) inviting pool after a day at the beach. From the hammock you can enjoy the"
50,"We have stayed at the Flor de Maria for 10 winters. What a great place to visit.   The owners and staff  are our friends.  We look forward to each visit.  What a great place to relax.  It is great walking distance to all parts of town. The resturant is a great place to eat.Alex and his bar is the place you want to spend a hot afternoon and gather to see people for a before dinner drink. We have talked about our great vacation spot.  We now have 3 other couples from Ames wanting information aout the area. Across the street from the Maria-is a great coffee shop.  Our friends think it like reading one of Hemingway's novels-because of the interesting people one meets in  the little cafe-across the street from the Maria.  Don't expect posh-like Cancun.  Flor de Maria is neat ,clean"
50,"My wife and I returned yesterday from a week's stay at the Flor de Maria. It was a lovely place to stay. The layout of the hotels is traditional, with all rooms around a central courtyard. The food is a special treat, and some of the finest in PE. Our room was comfortable (two double beds, ceiling fan, bath room with a good shower). Even though temperatures were in the 90s, there was no need for A/C. The hotel is 1/2 block from Playa Marinero, a terrific beach. Flor de Maria is 5-to-10 minute walk on the beach from both the Playa Zicatela beach and restaurants and the shopping street, El Adoquin. The owners, Jo Anne and Paul were very helpful and everyone there couldn't have been nicer. It's a special place. Go there!"
50,"Hotel Paraiso Escondido is an excellent hotel situated in the relaxed surf/beach town of Puerto Escondido. The hotel is well situated near the bus station, the main road and the beaches. The hotel is beautiful and cozy, with a colonial look. The staff was very friendly and the view from the hotel to the sea is great. The swimming pool and it's surroundings were also nice. The prices were a little higher than normal during our visit because of the high season (Semana Santa), but regular season rates of the hotel are of even better value. Anyway, this is certainly one of the best hotels in Puerto Escondido and I highly recommend it to any types of travellers."
50,"If you stay here, be sure to rent a Suite for the spectacular view. The property is a visual delight and the central location makes for anything you need, just steps away. If you find the menu to be limited, just ask Chef Roberto to prepare what you desire and if time allows his extensive experience will delight you. You get the impression that the staff like working there and no wonder, Sergio the manager and one man concierge leads by example...   he cancelled my lost credit card, booked flights and made local travel arrangements from his ever present laptop with the aplomb and efficiency of a Gran Tourisimo establishment. I will definitely return."
50,"This was our third stay at Paraiso and it was great as always.  My wife and I always stay in a suite and the view is fantastic. Sergio, the owner, is very gracious and the staff is very friendly and efficient.  We did not make use of the restaurant this trip but we have in the past and the food has been very good.  A very nice pool and attractive interesting grounds makes for a very pleasant stay. We will definitely stay there again!"
30,"We had a suite on the top floor which had a great view, lots of space and was very clean and quiet. There is also a little kitchenette for use by the suites.  Lovely grounds and pool but the suites were lacking a few finishing touches, like light fixtures and towel bars.  Otherwise, it was very comfortable and Sergio was very helpful with tour and flight reservations. If you want to stay close to the adoquen, right in town, this is a good choice at a reasonable price."
50,"A large group of us were at the Paraiso for 2 weeks.  Even after that amount of time we were still discovering strange little alcoves, sculptures & pieces of art.  The staff (except for the famous Sergio!) did not speak much English but bent over backwards to help you in any way they could.  They were all very friendly.  The location was great.  Close to OXXO store and a large supermarket.  Plus it was around a 5 - 10 minute walk to the beach.  My one and only complaint would be the beds were very hard.  This seems to be the norm in Mexican hotels though.  Paraiso Escondido is a beautiful little hotel, and we will definitely return."
50,"This hotel is very good.  We had a suite on the top floor and the views across the bays are to die for.    Staff very friendly and Sergio was excellent.  I got sick had to call doctor and Sergio went hunting at chemists for my meds!!!  Room very large and clean.  Bed good but would have liked a blanket.  Overall though I would return.  My legs got a good work out from going up and down the hill to the beach, shops and back.  Hubby went to the local supermarket, around the corner, nearly daily.  Thanks Sergio"
50,"A good location in the centre of Puerto Escondido – between the lighthouse and the bus station – with easy access to the beaches. We  [I, my two daughters (26 & 18) and my spouse] spent there five days in January 2011.  The hotel was peaceful. In the pool area one could choose between the sun and the shadow. Our rooms (2) on the 2nd floor were clean with a view over the pool area to the Pacific. The host, Don Sergio, as well as the personnel was friendly and helpful.  We highly recommend this hotel. Sami, Finland"
30,"We have had a wonderful two stays, this time eight nights, at this hotel BUT it seems impossible in Spanish to effectively communicate the importance of locking the doors when the maids are finished cleaning. Our room had both front and back doors and the back door was left unlatched on a regular basis both last year and this year despite repeated requests of the desk person and maids themselves; I REPEAT in fluent Spanish. I had to lug my notebook with me every day because I could not depend on security in the room. Yes, I did leave tips for the maids and desk person. Business is extremely poor these days because of the worldwide economy and flights are fewer to the local airport. Restaurant quality is suffering as well since most are virtually empty as are many hotels. If you"
50,"We stayed on the top floor in one of the suites.  Sergio is a wonderful host and nothing is too much trouble.  The rooms are clean, attractive and very well appointed.  We particularly liked the hotel as it is unique.  The architectural detail in the windows, nooks and crannies is amazing.  (Sergio's Father  is an architect).  The hotel was quiet despite being close to down town.  You will get your exercise in the 15 minute walk down the hill to the beach (or up the hill depending on which beach you choose!)  We would definitely recommend this hotel and you will not be disappointed."
50,"My wife and I recently decided to do a last minute trip to Puerto Escondido and discovered an absolute paradise...Casa de Olas.  We had the pleasure of spending 5 days here and truly enjoyed every minute of it.  The rooms were extremely clean, the common/pool area is incredible and the staff were all amazing and warm.  What a little treat when we found out that Friday nights are Salsa night at the hotel....we've never really done it before but it ended up being an absolute blast!   With a 5 min walk to the beach and the long boards and bikes available to rent to tour around this awesome little neighborhood, it really made our vacation all that we hoped.     Thank you again CDO....we'll be back again for sure!!"
50,"This is the best place in Puerto hands down. It is in La Punta (which is my favourite area) as it is very raw and authentic. The pool, the poolside bar, and the tennis court were all great, but the staff is what made the stay as pleasant as it was. Adamo (bar/food), Flor (front desk), and Efrain (the hotel manager) all helped make this my best trip to Puerto yet and I have been coming for 10 years plus. With that being said this is the nicest place I have seen in Puerto. It is the defintion of Boutique. Also salsa night hosted here on Friday nights are a must do."
50,"Just wanted to give a mad shoutout to all the wonderful staff at casa! Adamo, Monica, Flo and the rest of the crew were so incredible to us! We spent New Year’s Eve there and had a gourmet dinner prepared for us that was unbelievable! You don’t go many places with hospitality like that. The owners did a great job with the property and all the amenities were impeccable. They really thought of all the little things that make your stay that much better. Sun hats at the pool which was perfect to cool off in, hammocks and green space, dart board, surf boards, tennis courts and even a work out area! The walk to the beach is only a few minutes away too so location was great. Thanks again to the whole crew for a memorable vacay!! We’ll be back soon!"
50,"We had such an amazing stay here. The service and hospitality of all the staff was above and beyond - best that I’ve ever experienced! This boutique hotel has everything you need and more! The pool area is wonderful, the hammock and cabanas are great for relaxing, private tennis courts, roof top bar and salsa night was so fun! The rooms were comfortable and spacious. Location is excellent only a couple minutes to the beach and delicious restaurants. It has something for every type of traveller and everyone we met there was so friendly. The staff were like family by the end of our week there. They also have surf boards with gear and took us out and it was an epic experience. The atmosphere they have created on this property is unreal! I’ll definitely be coming back. Thanks for an"
50,"The thing that stands out the most to me is the hospitality. The staff felt more like my friends by the end of my stay. Jose and Flo took care of us with recommendations. It is a 5 minute walk to the beach, there are daily yoga classes, and Salsa on Friday nights! The pool/common area is gorgeous, with lots of amenities. Hats by the pool lounge chairs, a workout area, a hammock, games and bicycles. It was a magical stay and I highly recommend this unique experience."
50,"I have been to Mexico over 10 times but this past trip to Puerto Escondido and staying at Casa de Olas was truly magical. Upon entering the hotel, I was greeted by the friendly staff Jose who helped us with recommendations on where to go. Everyone at this hotel was super friendly, they have daily yoga classes, and salsa night on Friday's. I can't wait to visit this hidden gem again this year."
50,"I had the pleasure of spending a few days here and enjoyed every minute. The staff are so warm and welcoming and take it upon themselves to really go the extra mile to ensure their guests leave happy. They have everything nailed down from the best home made cocktails to salsa night up on their rooftop patio. It was a great way to meet other travellers/guests passing by. You’re able to relax by their beautiful pool, play some yard games, rest in the hammock or simply take a couple minute walk to the beach and/or other amazing restaurants. It’s a great location and I couldn’t have asked for anything more! Looking forward to coming back!"
50,WOW! What a place this boutique hotel was. From the decor to the staff to proximity to the beach to access to town. It had everything and more. Staff could not have been more helpful with any queries I had. Love this place 🥰
50,This place is one of the most chilled out and relaxing places I’ve been to. The staff really know how to look after their guests. Really close to the beach with some of the best surfing I’ve ever done... can’t wait until next year till I get back 👍👍
50,"I’d like to provide a testimonial to Casa De Olas Adam, Efrain, Floer, Oliver, Jose, Paola. I wanted to first & foremost formally thank these staff members and if I missed any names my apologies. They really know how to treat guests and made me feel very comfortable. The boutique hotel is state of the art with a gorgeous rooftop patio and amazing rooms with kitchens and fridges. Amazing Yoga with Lulu, The tennis court is amazing and if you’re looking to be close to the beach I wholeheartedly recommend staying with them."
50,"Hotel no. 9, Hotel Escondido, 6 more Grupo Habita hotels to go. They keep getting better and better, I already had a favorite but everytime I visit a new one it becomes my new favorite. The great thing about these hotels is that they are all unique and amazing in their own way. Hotel Escondido was an escape of total serenity. They have great staff, impeccable service, the most romantic setting, delicious food, the relaxing sound of waves to soothe you all day and night, and good drinks (especially the tamarind smoothie). It's a remote location unlike any other, you are truly able to get away from life's daily distractions.   Although it's quite far from the main attractions of Puerto Escondido, it's worth the distance. You come here to rest, to enjoy the sounds of the ocean and"
50,"We escaped to Hotel Escondido for 3 days and we loved it. Every room is a separate villa with its own pool, it has its own bose sound equipment where you can connect your own music. The staff is always there looking after you. We took the yoga lessons and they were excellent, the yoga teacher is very good. The manager of the hotel was always there. The pacific and the beach are beautiful for a walk in the morning or during the sunset. Breakfast are great."
50,"Hotel Escondido is a small luxury hotel with only 16 villas which all have their own plunge pool and are directly close to the sea. There is also a huge amazing main pool where you can swim long lenghts. The service is very warm and friendly. Every one of the hotel team is very eager to fulfil the customers wish, give excellent support in order to provide a fully relaxing staying. You also get immediately personal support from the manager if necessary. The food is very delicious and fresh – and if you once have a special dish wish don’t be shy to ask the waiter Juan for a hand, he has a passion for food and will advise you extensively. As the hotel lies 30 minutes away from Puerto Escondido and the crowds (20 minutes main road, 10 minutes bumpy street) you are living totally"
50,"With just 16 private palapas, it feels like you've burned your bridges and a retiring to the western Oaxacan coast.   Beautiful and secluded - each step you take throughout the property feels like you're walking through an Architectural Digest feature.   The rooms achieve the perfect mix of simple elegance and rustic luxury.   With your own private plunge pool and spacious, well-thought out floor plan and patio, there's no need to leave your palapa. The huge slide out plantation shuttered pocket doors allow you to open your room up to enjoy the beach - just steps (on one side and the mountains on the other).  The hotel also offers a beautiful infinity pool, spa, restaurant, lounge, and private party space.  Without question, one of the romantic properties we've stayed at."
40,"This is a very beautiful hotel, with 16 villas with a little private pool in everyone of them. Quiet, huge private beach and a 50 mts pool. All beautiful and clean. My only issue was the food, I think their food should be simpler, from the villages next door. That mexican flavour that makes us love the place at its fullest. It´s not bad, it´s just not that amazing."
40,"The only panic during the trip was when I arrived and realized that there was no cell service . The local tower is 2-G and new phones ( iPhones 6 and 6+ ) only process 3-G or later technology. We were shown to our room and were impressed that everything promised in the photos was delivered . Nice bed , nice shower and extra nice plunge pool. The wifi in the room was faster than we were anticipating.  The first morning I took a taxi 30 Km to Puerto Escondido to receive 3-G phone service so that I could forward my calls. After returning to Hotel Escondido, Phil and I had a great breakfast and spent the first day in the plunge pool until sundown.   The second day was a beach day and the third day was a plunge pool day. Because of the remoteness, it is really easy to do nothing"
50,"From the warm and genuine greeting on arrival to the time you say good bye, Ingio and the rest of the team could show a large number of the big corporates how to provide personable service. The setting is idyllic, and the accommodation has all the boxes ticked for comfort and cleanliness despite the beach-side location. The setting means you are a lilttle way from the town (more taxi than a walk) but if peace, tranquility and excellent service are your goals, then you have found the right place. The food is traditional Mexican, but they were very accommodating to requests to simplify the meals to suit a European palate."
50,"They opened last year, still have some things to breach perfection, but it worths every penny. The room we had (#8) was sensational, the beds, so comfort, and pristine white the linens, the bathroom so spacious, every room has a small pool, and terrace. there are only 16, all in front of the ocean. The cactus garden is sensational and original.  The breakfast is outstanding, they have a buffet of fresh fruit, juices, bread, cereal, and besides, they make splendid ""huevos mexicanos "", chilaquiles and don't forget to have a splendid hot oaxaca chocolate. And finally the best of all: the staff !! with outstanding service, and big smiles. They make your day the best day. You can take very good advice and local tips from any of them. We knew some amazing places that they recommended"
50,"We recently returned from the Hotel Escondido, the facilities are excellent, location could not be better as you are in a deserted beach with only Casa Wabi about 1 kilometer away (worth the visit just to see a Pritzker winner building an artist retreat on the beach).  The service is outstanding as all of the staff is only looking for you to have the best time without intruding into the relaxing state the location enables you to be.  Although the hotel was full, we only seemed to run into people during breakfast or dinner.  The breakfast and lunch are excellent while dinner was only ok.  Finally the hotel organized us to go and see the biolumincence in the Manialtepec Lagoon, just as the scene in the film “Life of Pi” when the whale come up you live that same experience of"
50,"What a marvellous 3 nights we spent here at Hotel Escondido. It's a double Escondido, a real escape from the world. The attention to detail in this hotel, both in terms of design and service are second to none. The rooms were incredibly stylish, but not in that vapid way of luxurious hotels these days. This was real local design blended with the best of everything and done in a way that complemented this wild, remote landscape. It stole our hearts from the minute we arrived.  The service is also fantastic. Juan, the maitre de, is a larger-than-life character who really gives life and charm to the place. He instructs his team to consider your needs before you realise you might need water, a drink or anything else. Similarly, Mariano and the front desk team are incredibly helpful."
40,First be aware that the coast from Cancun to the south of mexico is not very safe for swimming. But if you know that then you will enjoy this hotel with two swimming pools and a club near the beach. The pros: - very helping staff (they allow me to do an early checking). - a beach club so you can enjoy doing nothing on a long chair with a beer or a margarita - perfect internet connection The cons: - noisy ac - buffets are ok with little choice - old rooms  Others:  - not on the main beach. it was ok for me  - they offer an all inclusive price. if there is no a big difference take it.
40,"We stayed here a couple of years ago and while the hotel isnt fancy the view sure is.  There were very few people in the hotel when we were here the last week of Feb so we ate a la carte every day instead of buffet. Food was great. beach club down the steps had nice bar with hammock chairs and always plenty of loungers to pick from. Ocean is really rough and quite dangerous to swim in but amazing to watch. We watched whales off shore and each night were treated to the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen. Rooms were plain but we were outside all day anyhow. Town was a short cab ride away, with huge beach to watch surfers and enjoy drinks and eats from beach bars. Friday night they close down the main street to traffic and have a great market night so dont miss that. We went"
40,"The resort is smaller and off the beaten track ... it's closer to a 2 hr drive from Huatulco.  The beach is beautiful though, with huge crashing waves.  We  had an extremely laid-back vacation at this resort.  Food was all buffet, not a lot of selection but adequate.  Wonderful sunsets and views from the hotel which is situated on a cliff overlooking ocean and beach.  Puerto Escondido and the Posada Real not nearly as touristy as other popular Mexican destinantions."
40,"The hotel is on a perfect location, you have beautiful view of the Pacific and a great garden to rest and relax. The beach is little further, there a quite a few steps to go down and up back but still that is not a minus. There were not many people on the beach also and that was really nice for me. Food is avarage, if you are lazy to go out pf the hotel its ok but I would adivse to go out. The rooms are clean and tidy, and in general quite. A big minus for me was that they don't really speak English (nor German) at the reception. Of-cource you can manage for some things but still this is a drawback. There is free internet connection, not the best quality but for some work, and VoIP calls its quite sufficient. There is a pool which look quite nice and clean, unfortuinately i"
30,"My husband and I visited the Posada Real last year and because we fell in love with the place, we came back this year.  Overall, everything remained exactly the same, however, there are some points worth mentioning:  The rooms do need some general urgent TLC, the bathroom doors are chipped and ours in particular didn't close. The cleanliness is still quite good and we appreciate the effort our cleaners put in when doing our room.  Regarding the food, it was probably worse than last year. It seems that because they cater for an all-inclusive market, they chose to cut corners. We found very cheap ingredients in our meals, like cheap processed cheese and bottled salad dressings, now this in itself would be alright if it wasn't for the prices they charge for the food, pretty much"
40,"The recent reviews of the Posada Real fall short of an accurate description. If you are looking for an upscale resort with all the accompanied snobbery and decadence then this place isn’t for you.  However, if you are looking for a nice clean hotel with good service, friendly staff and a top drawer beach club with ample space to unwind: Then you have found the right place and don’t hesitate to book. I have stayed a many Riu’s and other upscale resorts in Mexico and around the Caribbean and the Posada Real isn’t the same as these. It’s 3.5 or 4 star rating is accurate though. This hotel is two resorts in one. On the top of an Oceanside bluff sits a 1970s style hotel.  The rooms are simple yet comfortable. Firm beds, a desk, a television set, and a basic bathroom. It was once a"
30,"Booked online.  They guaranteed a level entry room(  no steps)   When we got there They had no rooms without stair access.  Made for a very difficult 4 days.  If you are not on the all inclusive plan, the food and drinks are way overpriced.  We were in Puerto for a memorial service .  The air conditioning works well and was appreciated.  Staff were very friendly."
40,"I went with my husband to Puerto Escondido, we wanted to relax by the beach, we needed a comofortable hotel with good facilities, but no frills.  Our experience was a very pleasant surprise. We enjoyed our time at Posada Real very much. The best of this hotel are the grounds, impecably kept. The downside is that some dishes on the menu are not that good and are quite expensive.  Rooms: the rooms are a bit on the small side, I would say that they could benefit from more surfaces to place your luggage. The rooms are kept pristine.  Food: we booked a package that included drinks and breakfast. Breakfast buffet was excellent with a good choice of fresh fruit, eggs to taste, and Mexican food. All coffee you want, bread, hot cakes, the lot. Seafood and fish at the beach club was"
40,"My husband and I joined friends at Posada Real for one week In March.  We purchased our room on expedia for $85/night including drinks.  We upgraded for a larger room with an  unbelievable ocean view.  No balcony but the large picture windows opened.  The room had a tile floor, king sized bed, table and chairs.  Plenty of storage.  A small sink area and a marble shower that was very nice.  Great pressure and plenty of hot water.  Maid service was prompt and through.  We always left  at least $3.00 each day.  We always had fresh sheets and towels and they folded any thing we left out.    They also left plenty of bottled water.  The water was cold but wonderful cold water dispenser in the hallways were wonderful.  Very basic rooms but large and clean and comfortable if you pay to"
30,"The hotel was beautiful, we were only really there in the mornings for breakfast and to sleep at night, other than that we were out enjoying the beautiful beaches and the city.  We chose this location because it still has a more local feel to it, it wasnt as ""touristy"" as a lot of the other places.   All the food and drinks were included at the resort, which was pretty good.  I wouldnt recommend the local hot springs tour, it was sitting on the back of a trail horse in 40 degree celcius heat wih no water for an hour and a half to get to a man made hot spring, not exactly what you want after the long ride there.  The hotel staff were very friendly as well.  Not far away is Huatulco, its a bit more touristy with soe ritzier hotels if thats what your into."
50,"We based ourselves here for a mini trip around the area & Manfred & Angie couldn't have been more helpful.  Its a bit outside the main Puerto Escondido town, but only a 20cent taxi ride into town (taxis all the time, really safe). The hotel only has about 6 or 8 rooms I think, so really nice & small, not corporate, more family run.  The gardens are beautiful & well kept by Manfred. The beach at Carazallio is only a 5 min walk away, so really convenient. With a sprinkling of restaurants just up from the hotel itself - but i'd encourage you to have breakfast at the hotel  - as it is amazing! Even though there is a Cafe Cito just 3 mns walk up the road, that is an incredible , bustling place to go for brekkie too.  There's a great coffee place (try their handmade choccies too) plus"
30,"We booked a ten-day stay over New Year's in one of the apartments here based solely on Tripadvisor reviews. It didn't work out very well for us.   We were suprised to find that the villa is NOT so close to the beach. It looks close on the map but then there is a very long steep staircase to get down to the water. There is no sea view from the villa (maybe a sliver of distant blue between the palms). There are few nearby amentities and few restaurants. To get to the main beaches shopping and eating areas, you have to take a cab (cheap, but inconvenient).   When we visited, the property next door was under construction and you could not get to the back garden without walking to the end of the block and around. The indoor hallway seemed very dark and dingy. Another suprise - no"
50,"It is a fabulous Hotel in excellent location but quiet and very close to the Carrizalillo beach. The penthouse is awesome. Cost benefit ratio is overhelming. Besides you can eat near by at THE CAFECITO and the mini market  at just one block away. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.   We came by car fom Mexico City, Ixtapa, Acapulco and the roads are very good and safe. There is no problem in this part of Mexico at all. Best beaches nearby are; Zicatela, Mazunte and Agustinillo. Best Restaurant by far is GUADUAS at the end of Zicatela Beach, Gourmet Mex Thai."
50,I stayed in the bungalow and in one of the regular rooms and both were lovely.  The beds are fantastic and very comfortable.  I really liked the stone bathrooms and the elegant design details throughout.  If this hotel was in a lot of other places it would cost a lot more to stay.  But.. my favorite part was the early mornings sharing coffee with Manfred and Angie.  They are nice people and indulged my excitement and enthusiasm for Puerto.  I plan to stay there again and have no hesitation to recommend the hotel to others.
50,"I've never felt compelled to write a review on any product, service or experience, but this place is something else; it was fantastic. We selected Macondo y Mozart based largely on tripadvisor reviews and wondered if it would live up to expectations. We weren't disappointed. Angelica and Manfred truly are genuine in their hospitality and the atmosphere that they've created is just what we were after. Thoroughly recommended!"
50,"My husband and I chose to stay at Villa Mozart because of the reviews on Trip Advisor and found that it was the best choice we could have made for our first trip to Puerto Escondido.  Our hosts were friendly and bent over backwards to make us feel comfortable, even providing fresh flowers and a bottle of wine on one occasion.  From our balcony, we often enjoyed the jazz music that Manfred played.  He picked up a new iPod charger for me in town when mine quit working and drove us to the airport when our trip ended.  We had one of the spacious apartments on the second floor with balconies at the front and back and original artwork on the colorful walls.  The location is very convenient to restaurants, shops, a small grocery and even a laundry.  It is just above Playa Carrizalillo,"
50,"Okay, I have to admit I'm a little biased - after I found out that Manfred, the owner, likes Ornette Coleman, Sonic Youth, Don Cherry, and Yo La Tengo, how could I possibly not like someone with such good taste in music. But the main thing here is the ""vibe"". You know, the kind of place after you've been there for  half an hour, you just know that it's going to be a relaxing, comfortable place to come back to day after day. And on top of that it's very clean, comfortable bed, good ceiling fan, small safe in the room for your valuables, cool art, and a great garden and outside seating area to read or hangout. And it's very reasonably priced. I stayed in one of the rooms on the main floor - Karo I believe - and it opened right onto the garden. I also got a chance to look around"
50,"I've traveled quite a bit, and I'm a travel writer. And Villa Mozart is in my top three places I've ever stayed at. Manfred and Angie are super, super nice. But not in your face...the perfect combo! We stayed in the bungalow, which is huge and features a king size bed. Playa Carazillo is the best beach in the area - quiet, hardly any people - and it's just a block away. Don't worry - the beach still has a bar. The hotel is a 15 minute walk to Playa Principal and a 25 minute walk to Zipolte. You'll be glad it's that far away, especially because it's just a $3 cab ride  to get there. There is a strip of restaurants around the corner, including an Italian joint with some of the best Italian food I've ever had, and El Cafecito, which features the world's best french toast."
40,"Been there in Juli 2009 for two weeks. The room was clean and comfortable, with fan and safe and decorated exactly as you could see on the website-... real cool. Kind of paradise garden in the back. Very nice host who cares for his guests. Due to the season, there some more mosquito in the garden than I would have liked, but they are kept out of the rooms by fly screens and if you use OFF-they are off:-).  Greets to Manfred and many thanks for the great hospitality.  Björn"
50,"Hello! I got married in Puerto about 3 blocks away from Villa Mozart. The owner, Manfred’s fiancé, Angie, planned the entire wedding. It was beyond beautiful. Part of the wedding party stayed at Villa Mozart and the other part stayed at Junta al Mar.  Manfred and Angie are the most amazing and kind hosts I have ever met. Every single thing was taken care of. Angie planned all of the decorations and the food arrangements. The decorations were beautiful and the food was amazing. She also arranged for a bartender to come 3 of the nights, he mixed mojitos and played music. Everyone loved it. The bridal party, Tom (my husband) and I stayed our last three nights at Villa Mozart. Everyone loved their rooms, especially the people staying in the apartments. Tom and I stayed in the"
50,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights a few weeks ago and have been meaning to write a review!   This place is great - awesome quiet pool, steps away from the beach, lush big rooms, big bathroom, communal kitchen, and all for a reasonable price! Manuela was lovely and so relaxed - love the fridge full of beers (only 15 pesos!!) that you can just help yourself to.  Hopefully will make it back one day!   Iain and Amelia"
50,"Excellent location one block back from main drag and beach. Quiet. Pool is especially nice bonus since it was very hot during our stay. We paid 6,200 pesos for 7 nights, a good price. Helpful and attentive on site owners. Our room was clean and adequate size. Good hot water. Excellent in-room WiFi. Walkable to the beach and several good restaurants. Taxis to various parts of town are cheap (about 30-40 pesos)and plentiful. A taxi to the airport cost 30 pesos but from the airport to the hotel in a large van cost 250 pesos, not sure why. Many tours available to nearby venues. A popular tour is a sunset tour for baby turtle release. Oasis is a good choise for convenience and relaxation."
40,"We stayed here late feb and had such a great experience! The grounds are beautiful and serene, there is a beverage fridge you just keep a tab with, the rooms are extremely clean and the host manuel was the most helpful and easygoing we have met! We had trouble finding it the first night as I hadn't clarified its location, the taxi driver had no clue about zicatela and Google maps was freaking out. So my only advise would be check the address, its down an alley near the OXXO on the main drag. Enjoy!"
40,we enjoyed our four nights a true little oasis very pleasant and quiet. Our room was near the kitchen which was very convenient. The room was quiet  spacious and very clean . The host very helpful and friendly. We would definitely go back.  
50,"I found the Swiss Oasis on line and every step of the way was made easy by the delightful couple who own this Hotel.  Emails were quickly answered and all questions were addressed.  Upon arrival I was greeted with a warm, friendly smile as Manuela took me to my charming room that was impeccably clean, charming, and oh so peaceful.  The Swiss Oasis is steps away from the beach, the grocery stores and restaurants yet they have created a true oasis with their landscaping.  I felt very relaxed and safe during my three week stay there and will definitely book with them again!   Thank you,   Carol from Anacortes, Washington, USA"
50,Great little boutique hotel with beautiful grounds and a nice sparkling pool to relax at end of the day.  Steps away from a surfers beach with plenty of lounge chairs to watch the huge waves. Just a short walk down the beach brings one to an awesome swimming beach.   This little peace of paradise is smack In the middle of town with the owners giving you there special touch making all your vacation dreams come through. ..highly recommended  but then I love the close knit feel.
40,"Avoid the frenetic pace of the world; try the Hotelito Swiss Oasis when staying at Playa Zicatela. We stayed in Room No. 4 for six nights as it was very well appointed and the pillow-topped mattress and hammock were 'oh so comfortable'. It was nice to see that they believe in the ""honor system"" for cold beverages consumed and their community kitchen served us well for toast and coffee in the morning. We especially enjoyed the sanctity and beauty of the pool area; day or night, it was a true oasis. Our hostess, Manuela, impressed us with her ability to converse with all her guests in their language and we really appreciated her personal touch of reaching us via email to confirm our needs before we left on our vacation. Would we recommend this hotelito to our friends and"
50,"Wow, this place is truly an oasis.  Beautiful flowers, ultra clean little pool, just a few steps from the beach, beer for 15 pesos, and the most congenial hostess in Mexico, Manuela.  Thankfully, no AC, because an excellent ceiling fan keeps the rooms cool."
50,"It is hard to believe I have been coming here for 5 years and haven't written a review of the Hotelito. I think subconsciously I didn't want it to be ""discovered""and overrun. Well, it has been discovered.  Gone are the days when you could just show-up and count on a room being available. I almost always stay in room #1 ( it wasn't available the first year because Rene and Manuela were living in it.) Does it get noisy?  Yes, occasionally. It is a surfing beach in Mexico. Room #1 & 2 are close to the small shared kitchen. Yesterday, yes I am staying there now, I awoke to the noise of 2 young Aussies loading their cooler for a fishing adventure. Annoying? Yes, but I just opened my door and pointed out they were probably disturbing everyone and asked if they would move into the"
50,"We have stayed in a few places in Puerto including a couple of the more expensive hotels and Swiss Oasis was by far the best. Set just behind the main strip on Zicatela it avoids the noise from the street which can be bad late at night.  The hotel pool was incredibly relaxing, the rooms big and spacious and the communal kitchen well equiped with salt, sugar, coffee etc for all to use. Fiona the owner really made our stay, she was incredibly kind, welcoming and helpful. We had a problem with the laundrey down the road and Fiona helped track down the owners for us. We really look forward to coming back to hotel Swiss Oasis."
50,"I cannot say enough good things about this place. My boyfriend and I were on the yoga retreat with Jenna T for five days in April and I enthusiastically second everything she wrote in her review. Villa Lili is lovely, peaceful and impeccably clean (very important to me). The rooms are spacious; decor is appealingly simple and tasteful. We had a large balcony looking out towards the ocean, which is a couple of blocks away - honestly, we could have sat there for hours, it was a beautiful way to begin and end each day. As Jenna mentioned, a fabulous breakfast was served every morning in the outdoor kitchen/dining area - delicious local specialties prepared by the incomparable Irene and fresh fruit like nothing we get here in the northeastern U.S. But the real treasure in Villa Lili"
50,"What started off as a disaster trip to Mexico with the 2 of us getting Salmonella day 2 was turned around after arriving at Villa LIli where the family Adelina, Luis and Claire made sure we saw doctors and had lots of electrolytes to get better. Thank you! Vila Lila is a beautiful place to stay, the accomodation is fantastic and cleaned daily. Breakfast is served daily with fresh fruit, cereal, fresh juices and a hot mexican meal cooked by onsite staff. Delicious! Vila Lili is centrally located walking distance to the city centre, restaurants and a swimming beach. It is a 30 peso taxi to main beach where surf is huge and the main street is filled with bars. If possibly you can arrange late check out and somebody will drive you to the airport or bus station for your departure. "
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Villa Lili last April for 5 nights and we really enjoyed it. I felt really special when we arrived at the airport and already had transportation waiting for us, making us feel like a celebrities.  We loved señora Irene's breakfast which was always Mexican style but never felt heavy. We also couldn't get enough of the fresh fruit that was served every morning.  The entire place is constantly kept clean and the pool area is very relaxing and enjoyable. Playa Carrizalillo is not to far from the hotel. It's a beautiful beach and a great place to relax. Adelina and Claire always made sure everything was ok and little Luisa kept us entertained. Overall we loved Villa Lili and hope to stay there again on our next visit to Puerto Escondido."
50,"Our family of four enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Villa Lili during our recent spring break trip. Claire, Louis and Adelina are fabulous hosts, full of local information and very helpful in ensuring we enjoyed our time in Puerto Escondido.  They provided excellent restaurant recommendations (we love good food!), booked an evening releasing baby sea turtles, and even arranged a small internal flight for us to Oaxaca, saving us hours of travel time.  Our girls are 7 and 5, so the quiet, neighborhood location of the villa was perfect for us.  We stayed in the exotica suite.  Its layout is quite unusual, including a large jacuzzi bath and fountain we didn't use, but we did love the open air and the height provided refreshing sea breeze all day.  The ability to walk to a"
50,"Lovely big room. Delicious breakfasts prepared by Irene. Adelina and Claire were so friendly and helpful. On our last day because our bus didn't leave till 7.00pm,they kindly let us use the room till then even though check-out time was 12.00. Also gave us a lift to the bus station. The pool area was so inviting. Great strip of restaurants around the corner. Close walk to beaches. Do the lagoon tour - it's unmissable!"
50,"A group of friends and I stayed at Villa Lili during our yoga retreat in Puerto. I could not have been more pleasantly surprised at how amazing this place was! The pictures don't do it justice. Adelina, Louis and Claire are beyond amazing- accommodating, knowledgeable and hospitable, in addition to great company during meals! The breakfasts made by Irene were the most delicious food I've ever consumed and I drank about 10x as much coffee as usual because it was just that good! The fruit was incredibly fresh and all of the dishes were so flavorful and authentic! The rooms were incredibly spacious and comfortable. The outdoor space is incredibly peaceful and the pool is a perfect temperature :) If you are looking for a hotel in Puerto, this place cannot be beat! The amazing people"
50,"We really enjoyed our time at Villa Lili. The rooms are big and clean and have everything you could need. The breakfasts were amazing! Trust me don't miss breakfast. We were very well looked after by Claire, Adelina and Louisa, they really made us feel at home. Claire was so helpful, booking us in for the lagoon tour and massages and suggesting all the good places to eat and drink in the area. Hopefully we will make it back before too long."
50,"We turned up at Villa Lili's sister hotel at about 8.30 in the morning, with no booking and 2 nights to stay.  Although Quinta Lili was full, we were swiftly rescued by Adelina and taken to view Villa Lili, where we then had the luxury of being the only guests in the hotel for those 2 days.  It is a great hotel.  The room was just right - reasonably simple but spacious and with everything you needed.  The pool is lovely - actually there are really 2 pools - all beautifully designed.  There is plenty of space to relax - including on the balcony by your room if you want.  The service was first rate.  Both Adelina and Claire were excellent hosts - really friendly, helpful and relaxed.  The breakfasts were fantastic.  The beautiful Carrazalillo beach is an easy walk away, just with"
50,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our time at Villa Lili.  Clean, comfortable, relaxing, hospitable staff and a great location near Playa Carrizalillo.  Nice to be abel to wake up, take a dip in the pool and then enjoy a delicious Oaxacan style breakfast."
50,"We spent the month of February, 2013, at Villa Lili and this, very clean & comfortable, Mexico designed hotel is an ideal accommodation!  An easy walk to the best swimming beach, Carrazalillo, in Puerto Escondido as well as rinconada with several good restaurants. Walk to banks, supermarket, the Mercado and many, many shops in the town center or a short cab ride to the excitement & hustle bustle of Zicatela surfing beach.  Villa Lili's courtyard and pool area is perfect for relaxing with a cold beverage and discussing the days activities with the other guests. Irene's authentic Oaxcan breakfasts are better than any restaurant we've tried in Mexico!  In the last ten years we've traveled Mexico's west and east coasts and the Yucatan in an RV, fly and self drive trips as well as a"
50,"I was warmly welcomed by Swantje and David Salinas, the owners of the Puerto Surf House (http://puertosurf.com.mx/en/) in December 2009, my first visit there. I loved the experience so much that I wanted others to know about it. Swantje and David are welcoming, kind, flexible. They are both amazing teachers - she teaches Pilates (and also gives an incredible Thai massage) and he focuses on surfing. If you never thought you could surf, he's the man for you.  It is a family-run business with a lot to offer. They have two rooms with double beds and private baths. The rooms are clean and have a bed (with bednets), drawers, side-tables and desk). There is no internet or TV (Internet you can find across the street at the organic restaurant). They have kitchen facilities just outside"
50,"Honestly, I was weary when I read the QL reviews on Trip Advisor.  How can a place be ""excellent"" for years in a row?  I wanted to find out, so I booked a room (via the site, Quinta Lili is not on booking.com, maybe for the best - it stays kind of 'secret' that way) and drove all the way from Oaxaca city to Puerto Escondido through the mountains, a six hour drive.  No airco, no power steering.  You can imagine how I felt exhausted upon my arrival at Quinta Lily.  Normally, when I travel and I'm tired, I am very critical about the places I arrive at.  I always feel a little disappointed when I compare the pictures I have seen with the real thing.  Well, Quinta Lili -on the contrary- exceeded my expectations immediately.  The relaxing music playing softly in the background, the"
50,"If you are looking for a small and quaint BB you can't go wrong with Quinta Lili. Charming spot, well situated , 5 minutes from beautiful beach, lots of nice and delectables restaurants. Quiet. Nice pool to refresh at anytime.We loved our room with the large patio for enjoying the sunset. We felt to be in our private house and sharing with friends. This place is very safe, clean and serves good breakfats.Most of all, the hostess Adelina was SO HELPFUL. She was almost our private concierge. Thank you and wish you great success. Looking forward to go back."
50,"Thank you Adelina and Magdalena for making our Puerto visit so perfect. Quinta Lili is a beautiful boutique hotel -- only 5 rooms with a lovely small pool and tranquil palapa area. The location is ideal, within walking distance of Carrizalillo Beach and all the restaurants on the Rinconada.  Our room was attractive, clean and comfortable, and the authentic Mexican breakfasts were delicious. Wish we could be there right now enjoying the ocean view from our balcony."
50,"We stayed at Quinta Lili for a week on our honeymoon. A friend of a friend recommended it. It was our first time in Mexico and we will definitely be back to stay at Quinta Lili. The master suite is the way to go. Adelina, the owner made it her mission to make sure we had everything we needed. She went above and beyond, and all of her suggestions regarding things to do and places to eat were spot on. I hate to reveal such a precious secret as Quinta Lili but its hard not to want to share something so special."
50,Short walk to a fabulous beach.  Owner is delightful; always smiling and helpful.  Clean and comfortable and within walking distance of all you could need.  Hope to stay here again one day.  Can't imagine better value!
50,"Quinta Lili is one of those little places you'd rather people didn't hear about -- it's such a treasure whenever you're in need of some absolute tranquil bliss. But keeping the secret wouldn't be fair to your wonderful host Adelina. She's endlessly cheerful and always helpful with the latest great dining and excursion tips. This is the way to experience Mexico away from those all-inclusive bubbles that can sometimes seem like some little Canadian enclave  transplanted to a private beach. Adelina and the tireless Magda prepare a different authentico breakfast for you every morning, steps from your room and the small, refreshing pool. Only five rooms here, so it's not at all unusual to have the place to yourself at times. This area of PE, Rinconada, is removed from the somewhat"
50,"We had a wonderful time at Quinta Lilil.   The location is great right behind the nicest beach in PE. The rooms and premises are safe, clean , spacious and very nicely decorated. There is a chill out area with super nice music by the pool, a bar to relax and laze...  But what makes the place really special it's the people : the owner Adelina a super energetic and really kind Mexican lady who has tastefully decorated and arranged the place , the staff and the cook who is preparing fresh breakfasts every day.  Adelina provides great advices, small chat , and is overal a charming hostess with all the guests contributing to make the saty at Quinta Lili a wonderful experience.   We liked: the space, setting, interior design and landscaping of the place,overal atmosphere and cooking. "
50,"This is a slice of paradise.  Lovely boutique hotel.  It often felt as if we were in our own, private resort except with a great, friendly staff.   Magdalena provided a hot breakfast every morning; while you are lounging around the pool,  beer, coke, etc. available in the fridge on an honor system.  Comfortable beds.   It is a bit of a hike to the beach.  A tourist district with good restaurants is within easy walking distance.  It is a longer walk, maybe 20-25 minutes, to the city center.  Easily available cabs can take you back and forth for 20 pesos.  Owner, who speaks excellent English, provided us a thorough orientation to the community and helped us set up a birding tour."
50,"Quinta Lily is in a perfect location for non-surfers – within easy walking distance of the best beaches, excellent (and cheap) restaurants and the harbour/main shops. The boutique hotel has all relevant facilities (including internet access) although the pool is small;  the rooms are spotless; and the special cooked Mexican breakfasts are delightful. Most of all, the proprietor – Adelina – is immensely welcoming and helpful and very involved in the local community, arranging for us to help release baby turtles at a conservation centre at a nearby secluded beach. Highly recommended."
50,"I loved it since the moment Magda opened the door.  breakfast tasted like home. Adelina the owner she really makes you feel like home and the place is so comfy, relaxing. the music makes it very special. the room was clean and fresh. QUINTA LILY IS A MOST IN PUERTO ESCONDIDO"
50,Wow! This place is amazing! The rooms are perfect to unwind in after day at the beach surfing at pipe or exploring the sights. Not to mention the perfect private beach below the hotel and the AMAZING restaurant on site. Sipping a cocktail watching the sunset here was absolutely perfect!
40,"A mostly good stay.  Very helpful in booking VivaAerobus tickets for me. Easy to get to and from airport  Rooms are a bit rougher/more basic than the photos may indicate.   Our housekeeper was fantastic, a good cleaner and lovely.   Though calmer than other beaches, getting in and out of the water can still be rough, water temp was good.   The restaurant has a nice outlook and is good for a meal or two but menu is limited if you are staying for long.   Also, in five weeks travelling around Mexico everywhere else I never got sick despite eating everywhere.  Here, I only ate in their restaurant, didn't drink the water and did get food poisoning.  These are just the facts, in this case I had zero chance of getting sick from anything else.  I feel a bid sad writing this as they"
50,Great view above maybe the best beach between Alaska and Ushuaia on the Pacific. Nice pool and attention to detail on construction. The Colorado room is absolutely the best for views perfectly framing the beach scene below. Outstanding bedding.  
50,"Beautiful location, facilities and food - never wanted to leave!  Located about a 3 minute taxi from town, these villas overlook the most beautiful beach - carrizalillo beach - a cove with pristine aqua water and local palapas from which to rent chairs and order cold drinks.  Our room, Mitla, overlooked the beach with a terrace. The bed was sensational. And, the bathroom was huge. The perfect honeymoon room.  Lastly, the food was delicious and well priced. Not a bad thing on the menu!  Absolutely stay here - you will not regret it!"
50,"We stayed in the Holanda villa, which is in a great location, near the bar and overlooking the water. The patio was wonderful. Just note that you have to walk down a lot of stairs to get to the beach. That said, the beach below was beautiful and not too crowded. There are bikes, boogie boards, surfboards, and snorkeling gear for rent as well. The restaurant next to the villa is fabulous and has great service."
40,"The plant is well kept and the setting is great. Nice and quiet resort an inexpensive cab ride to Puerto  Escondido. 167 steps down to the beach,a bit hard on these  64 year old knees but a worthwhile climb both up and down. The on site restaurant is quite good too. "
50,"We had previously traveled to Puerto Escondido and loved it!! When choosing somewhere for our destination wedding we wanted an amazing location and somewhere really special, as we were travelling all the way from Australia. After a little bit of research we came across Villas Carrizalillo....and it was so perfect!!   We only left yesterday after staying 9 nights and I couldn't write this review quick enough!!! Thanks to all the staff there, especially owner Amy, our wedding day was beyond perfect. Planning a wedding from a different country via email can be quite difficult at times however Amy made it so easy and organised everything from our celebrant, cake, flowers to the mariachi band (best part of the day!!). Marcelo from the Espadin Restaurant was really helpful with"
50,"My friend and I stayed at Villas Carrizalillo for seven nights. It was an excellent experience. The location is excellent, in a quiet area on a cliff directly above Playa Carrizalillo. There is a private staircase down to the beach. Bikes, surf boards, and boogie boards are available. The staff is friendly and helpful. They can set you up with Spanish or surf instructors, tours, excursions, etc. The villas (at least the one I stayed in) are comfortable and roomy, with full kitchens and plenty of space. The view from the deck is spectacular. There is a restaurant as well. The food is not great, but the view is really great.  I will definitely stay again on my next trip to Puerto. I want to try one of  the villas with ocean view!"
40,I agree with all the positive comments regarding the hotel.  I found the stairs to the beach hard to negotiate going down and going up.  Anyone with physical limitations might find them very daunting.  Handrails would make all the difference.  I had to negotiate the stairs VERY carefully.  The beach was absolutely stunning and the water was warm and very safe so I tried not to think about the climb back up the stairs at the end of the day.
50,"The Villas Carrizalillo is beautiful with access to a great beach. The on- site restaurant is very good. Staff friendly and helpful. Many speak both English and Spanish. Terrace bar is great place to watch sunsets; great bar tender. The Villas are beautiful, many with private terraces and ocean views. On- site owners. Well managed and maintained."
50,It's already the 5th time we are organizing our group event here and we'll be back in October for the next. We have had Yoga Teacher Trainings and Wellness programs. All participants love the place. The owner Willets and his staff do a great job making you welcome and making sure all will run smooth. An extra bonus is that smoking is not allowed anywhere in the hotel.
50,The wellness retreat: I didn't do the whole 10 days but the time I was here was fantastic. We ate wonderful food and I lurnt so much about how to look after my body and the information was practical so I will be able to continue when I get home. I can't wait for the next one!!! The hotel: There is a really beautiful clean swimming pool and the staff are so friendly and will help with any problem you have and THEY SPEAK ENGLISH. All of the rooms are immaculate and cleaned daily!
50,"I always enjoy coming back to my winter home & family.  The owners attempt to accommodate every request, and the staff are good, friendly & helpfull.  I'll return next year for 2 months for the 8th visit."
50,"Nice rooms with kitchenette, ability to add air conditioning for those who need a little break from the heat. 2-minute walk from the massive beach where you can find a spot of your own, or head down a bit where you can enjoy lounge chairs with table service. Hotspot for surf enthusiasts. Staff was fun and friendly, and always eager to help of you need anything, and the hotel is fully enclosed with password-protected doors for those looking for something a little more secure. Nice pool and a little kitchen if you want to order a nice snack. Beds aren't the nicest but I would stay here again."
50,"My family recently had the opportunity to stay at Casamar, and honestly I have been reluctant to share our experience as I want this place to be my own little secret.  But alas that would be a disservice to the fine group of people that run and own this wonderful piece of paradise.  The service was wonderful, whether it was getting a cab for visit to an area restaurant, setting up spanish lessons for our 10 year old son, arranging for surfing lessons, horseback riding on the beach, etc.  Each of the rooms are unique so do spend time reviewing each one.  We stayed in Plumeria which was an oversized suite with a wonderful patio where you can see and hear the ocean.  The daily maid service was timely and very courteous.  Day's were spent lounging by the pool, taking a stroll to the"
50,"This is the second time that I have stayed at Casamar.  I was there ten or eleven years ago. I picketed Casamar the second time because I liked it so much the first time.   The rooms are nice and clean and the rates are reasonable.  Casamar has nice pool and is close to surfing, if that is what you wish to do.   The staff and owners  are helpful in finding interesting this to do."
40,"Me and my wife where looking for a place at Puerto Escondido. We found Casamar suites on VRBO.Its a nice place with a nice pool and courtyard,well kept up.We stayed in the suite with a private yard,very nice but can very noisy since its beside the main road with a contractor on the other side with his machinery. The one problem we had was ,the next day we had to go and buy bleach and clean the kitchen.It was quite dirty,flies coming out of the cracks of the tile grout,crap in the bottoms of the utensil holder and fork and spoon holder etc.Looked like roach dung. So it took us a while to clean all that.We told the maids we would clean our own dishes.My wife also seen the maid use the tea towel to dust the place then put it back in the kitchen.we seen all kinds of cleaners in"
30,"We had the uppermost unit with a view of the sea and a lovely terrace (the plants were in need of a good pruning and weeding).  There was a small kitchen, bathroom, bed and a place to hang clothes.  A nice sized room and terrace.  The room was in desperate need of a thorough cleaning.  The blinds were filthy, the kitchen and bathroom sinks needed a good scrubbing and the toilet had a ring in it when we arrived.  Not sure when it was last given a good cleaning.  A lot of dust under the bed. I'm not a fussy person, but the cleanliness was an issue for me, especially given the price we paid for the week.  I would not have my own guests in my home stay in a room this dirty.  The grounds and pool area were lovely, very well kept and comfortable . Location - far from Zicatela but"
40,"We picked Casamar Suites because of it's location and we were not disappointed. The hotel has wonderful suites, is very clean and the staff is absolutely lovely. The courtyard garden and pool area is beautiful and quiet.  Casamar is a 5-minute walk from La Punta beach which is a stunning beach.  Would definitely recommend staying at Casamar!"
50,We had an amazing stay at Casamar. We had the Cocos suite with beautiful ocean view. It wasnt hot at all because of the constant breeze. The whole place looked like an oasis. Will definitely recommand! Thank you
50,"Perfect location for a relaxing vacation. Staff are friendly and helpful.  Is a fully equipped resort. The seclusion of the resort is nice. You’re only minutes from Puerto Escondido and there is a shuttle.   The beach at Vivo is wonderful. Often see whales and other sea life. Puerto Escondido mercado, beaches, and Gina’s tours were fantastic. "
40,"Being a fairly new resort it is definitely in awesome condition. The pools are clean, landscape is in immaculate condition and the staff are friendly. But being a Canadian resort has its downfalls. Alcohol is several dollars a drink and food is more then typical mexican restaurants. "
30,"The resort itself is nicely designed and maintained. Condos are very clean. Unfortunately, there was no potable water as advertised because they were cleaning the system for a week while we were there. They brought a large (5 gallon) water jug but we had to call for them to bring a spput for it bc it didn't have one. The one they brought was cheap and fell off all the time. We also had to ask for bags of ice as the water jug was obviously too big to fit in the fridge. They should have supplied ice from the get-to. We used the spa services which were nice, although you could hear people talking outside during the entire service. The restaurant was delicious and very fresh. However, they didn't have a single salad on the menu so we had to ask for them to be prepared. Then they"
50,"This time we stayed at Casa Delfin. The villa was amazingly beautiful. Every day of the week was almost perfect as usual. Leather was on the day of departure total chaos at lunch. The service was bad and took an extremely long time. The food was changed several times and was not edible at the end. Unfortunately we had to finish without food and drove with this last impression to the airport. On my last 4 visits something like this has never happened. Retroactively, I can say that Vivo Resort has changed in the last 6 months. It used to be familiar."
40,We rented a gorgeous one bedroom condo. The condo was very spacious.  The resort was very clean and well kept. The restaurant was very good as was the bar.  The pool was lovely and always enough loungers. I found the staff to be very pleasant and courteous. Of note is the shuttle service which was limited.  Construction is ongoing but stopped at 4:00. Would definitely return and look forward to another vacation.
40,"This is a resort,not a hotel,although the rooms and bedding are tended to daily.Situated on a long stretch of private beach,each ocean facing condo is spacious,and very well appointed.The restaurant has a limited menu,but all the daily 'specials' were excellent.We enjoyed a wonderful week here,and met some really lovely people.(Virtually all the residents were Canadian).The on-site shop was inadequate,and although there is a very good supermarket in town,it is a £10.00 ride.My only quibble....access to condo's is via a code on door.A neighbour gained access accidentally,but too easily.This needs to be addressed."
50,My husband and I spent 2 weeks at Vivo and were thrilled with our entire time there. The location is private but not remote. The beaches are extensive and made for looooong walks. The suite we rented was beautifully appointed and kept exceptionally clean by the staff. And the food was exceptional! They don't serve food in their restaurant - they serve world class cuisine!!!
50,"This was our second trip to Vivo Resorts in Puerto Escondido and it was amazing.  Quiet days on the beach, floating in the pool, drinks at the bar, aqua aerobics, turtle releases, great food, excellent staff and perfect rooms.   Nothing is missed at this resort.  You can shuttle out for the day or enjoy all that Vivo has to offer.  Puerto Escondido is a truly beautiful place and I hope to be back some day."
50,"We had a very enjoyable stay at Vivo Resort .we spent 1 week with family and 1 week on our own .The Resort was immaculate ,service and food was excellent Staff were friendly and very personableThe setting was very relaxing .The tranquility garden is beautiful We would highly recommend this Resort to friends and acquaintances. Gardens and lawn  nicely maintained. ,beautiful flowers and shrubs."
30,"This place is not for people who are interested in Mexico as a country and culture. It is run by Canadians and designed for Canadians, and we found it a bit claustrophobic, if you can believe that. We heard complaints about not enough English speakers. Our main purpose was a comfortable stay by the sea while we explored the Laguna de Manialtepec, which was (is) fantastic. The  condo itself  was well equipped (other than no coffee grinder), well ventilated, and nicely furnished.  We got there at check in time on Friday, but did not notice no box for the TV until later that day, we had technicians in the condo until 11 at night and service remained unresolved until the following afternoon when the power came on again.  The explanation for the TV was that the Canadian feed was"
40,"My friend and I stayed in Puerto Escondido after spending a month in Oaxaca city. It was beautiful, the food was tasty, and the mojito (spelling???) drinks were perfect! I would agree with the point made be another reviewer that the owners were a little off-standish, but the staff seemed fine to us."
50,"A friend and I have just spent the best part of a week at the Hotel Flor de Maria and thought it was fabulous. Paul was very helpful and accomodating as were his entire team.  I could not speak highly enough either of the hotel or Puerto Escondido. In a couple of words, GET THERE !  Mark"
50,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Flor de Maria the first week of March 2003. We love you, Paul, Joanne, Alex, and all of the staff there. Oh, and Puchi too! (Their parrot.)I had done a lot of research on the hotels in PE and decided on Hotel Flor de Maria because it seemed a nice blend of small hotel, yet with great amenities, like a swimming pool. Plus, the location is perfect. Between the Adoquin and Playa Zicatela. The afternoon part of the day was spent up on the third floor with the swimming pool and the bar. Perfect and intimate. Hammocks, a great view and great sangria! Well, O.K., great mojitos too.Paul and Joanne, the owners, are just the nicest people and they make you feel totally welcome. A real bonus is the Cafecito, right across the street, where you can get a"
50,"We recently returned from a week in Puerto Econdido where we stayed at the Flor de Maria. We found that our accomodations turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip.  The hotel itself is absolutely charming with its beautiful courtyard and hand painted doors.  With only twenty-eight rooms we had soon met almost all the guests either at the restaurant or roof top pool and bar.  It gave the place the feel of a bed and breakfast. Our hosts, Joanna and Paul could not have been more helpful or friendly.  If you are looking for a holiday in Mexico where you actually spend most of your time interacting with Mexicans in an intimate yet very real setting, then this is the place for you.                                      Craig & Heather"
50,The owners of this hotel are wonderful.  We stayed at the Flor de Maria for one week during the 2002  Christmas season. Our car reservations were screwed up and nobody at the rental agency spoke Spanish.  One of the owners phoned the agency several times on our behalf until we got a car.  We have never felt so warmly welcomed and cared for as we did at the Hotel Flor de Maria!
10,"my. husband and i stayed at flor de maria.it is very beautiful,and the staff complains of being overworked,under payed and scaired of the owner.my husband became very sick,diareah and vomiting in the middle of the night when i went to get help to call a dr. i was told sorry the phone is locked in the drawer because the owner is worried about it being used,please wake the owner this is an emergency.i cant there was already an incodent and she will be very angry,i will lose my job.i ended up getting help to carry my husband to a nearby dr. he was dehidrated and recieved intravenus hydration.when i spoke to the owner the next day she did not even appolagize.we moved to rincon del pacifico where the staff seams much happier."
50,"Stayed here for 3 nights over new years eve.  Had no problems with noise even though you are relatively close to the main street.   We had a twin room (double beds) with aircon on the 2nd level.  The photos on the website are accurate.   Beds were very comfy, rooms are of standard hotel size, bathroom was nice and of standard hotel size.   The breakfast at their restaurant is very good.  Large portions and not overpriced as you would expect in a hotel.  Very tasty also!   The pool is kept very clean and there is plenty of sun and shade around it. The staff are very friendly and very helpful.  My wallet and phone were stolen whilst out on new years eve and the staff were very helpful to me when I was trying to obtain a police report for insurance purposes."
50,"I was in Puerto Escondido for a week with some friends of mine. We stayed at the Paraiso Escondido and we found the service to be impeccable. Sergio (the manager) was extremely friendly and welcoming, as were his family and all of the staff.  I managed to injure myself on the beach and had to be hospitalized, Sergio picked my girlfriend and I up from the hospital and even provided me with what turned out to be much needed crutches! The hotel is clean, quiet, charming and unique. it's close to one of Puerto's only banks, and just steps away from a major supermarket as well as the beachfront. A great find : )"
40,"This colonial style hotel in central Puerto Escondido makes one feel that you are in Old Mexico,despite the air conditioning and free wi-fi. The rooms are charming and the staff very helpful. It is not package-tour quality and that is just fine with me. This place has loads of atmosphere and that is what I seek in a foreign hotel.--Paul Gessell, Chelsea, Que."
50,"We stayed here for 10 nights with our 5 and 3 year-old.  Sergio bent over backwards to ensure our comfort, even moving us to the master suite so we wouldn't be bothered when  larger group came. The pools were a hit with our kids. Hotel staff were super, super friendly and professional.  Felt very safe. Clean bathrooms, reliable hot water, wifi. A bit removed from the hub-bub of the Adoquin, which means being removed from the noise, too.  Short cab rides to the playas -- Angelito, Manzanillo, Carrizalillo, and Zicatela (M$20-25 cab fare).  One downside: no blankets, just sheets, making climate control tricky when in-room A/C is on. All-in-all, a very pleasant stay. Muchas gracias, Sergio!"
50,"I can recommend this hotel without a blink. The rooms are nice and have a well working air condition, which is mandatory at that time, since it is humid and hot.  The people are more than nice and helpful. They smile all the time and let you know that you are very welcome as a guest. They support you in any plan you have, let it be Dolphin Wachting, Surfing, finding the a good restaurant or hook you up with the free Wi-Fi.  The rooms are clean and cleaned daily, beds are good and from the balcony you have a marvelous view over the bay and some parts of the city (basically all you see from the city are palm trees)."
50,"It is very good hotel, for good money value. The staff is very friendly and extremely helpful. The location of the hotel is also great (very close to Zicatela beach and Puerto Angel beach). The rooms are clean and comfortable. Aircondition is very good. Up to now it is the best hotel in Mexico in which I have stayed. I highly recommend this hotel. For sure I will come back here :)"
40,Nice designed Hotel with very nice Staff and a delicate Restaurant.
50,The hotel is really charming (kind of colonial style) and clean and the staff is super friendly (especially Sergio - the manager / owner). The spacious master suits in top floor have a view on the ocean and a large terrace. I definitely recommend it.   (The swimming pool is a bit smaller than it looks on the web but still OK.)
50,My baby and I returned to Hotel Paraiso because of their awesome service and location. We are always treated so well there and Super Che is located right behind the hotel. We stayed there for 2 weeks and had our own private kitchen and I enjoyed cooking for my man and laying in the sun. We had our own private balcony and we will go back again....
50,"This was our 4th Year in Puerto and the last 3 years we have stayed at Hotel Paraiso Escondido.  My husband and I both love the hotel and the location.  We were there for 3 weeks this year and were very sorry to say goodbye to the wonderful staff and Sergio.  Sergio bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed.  He has protected all our valuables in his safety deposit boxes (in the reception area  which has a security guard at night) for all these years...never a problem!    We have had the regular suites, the big suite and a room on the 2nd floor and all have been very comfortable and we slept very well.   Whenever we needed extra bottles of water (our girls left one for us every single day for 21 days) or extra towels, our girls gave them to us with a great big"
50,"I would give ten stars if possible! Casa De Olas is a calm, comfortable sanctuary managed by a wonderful team. Everyone is made to feel welcome and well looked after. Bedrooms with air con are spacious with a small living room and kitchen. Complimentary breakfast includes fruit, breads, juice and eggs. You can even make yourself omelette. Highly recommend staying here for ultimate relaxation, Casa de Olas is a home away from home."
50,Had a great stay at Casa de Olas from October 28th- November 7th. The hotel is one of the nicest I have ever stayed at. When I arrived I was more than impressed as it looks even better than it does on the photos. The turquoise room I stayed in was a very good size and had a fridge/ freezer and cooking amenities that means you can buy food in to avoid always eating out.  The layout of the hotel means that on an evening guests tend to congregate at the pool bar area which gives the place a real warm family vibe. This is also added to as all of the staff are very generous in their hospitality and they cannot do enough for you to make sure that your stay is as good as possible.  Puerto Escondido itself is amazing and the weather each day is fantastic. The location of casa de olas
50,"What a fabulous place to stay - the hotel is so charming a perfect getaway. The rooms are clean, cozy, comfortable and the entire property is has so many wonderful gems. But the best part of this hotel is the staff that goes above and beyond to make sure you’re stay is unforgettable. I loved Puerto and would recommend this place to anyone. Thank you for a fabulous month - I can’t wait to come back! "
50,"I stayed for a few weeks at Casa De Olas with a bunch of friends and it was the perfect spot to enjoy Puerto Escondido. The team there is amazing and makes you feel so at home and if you don’t want to leave... you don’t have to! There’s a bar, pool, tons of games and great vibes. If you do want to leave you’re just a few minute walk from the middle of La Punta, the best neighborhood in Puerto with tons of restaurants and an amazing beach.   Thank you CDO team, I’ll be coming back for sure! 🙏❤️"
50,"Casa de Olas is a cute hotel in tiny beach town. Rooms are quaint but modern with local finishes. Strong A/C, good wifi, the bartender is phenomenal, friendly vibes-the staff makes you feel at home. Highly recommend!"
50,"The best bartender - Adamo -  Clean and comfortable rooms. Great staff and services. Had a great stay. It was the perfect location for our group to gather with ample space for sunset yoga, group dinners, and the perfect location to explore PE."
40,"This hotel is really escondido.  Enjoy nature on a luxury way. Just 25 min trip from the airport, but away from everything. Located in front of the ocean; in the middle of the wilderness; every bungalow has a private pool. It´s the perfect place to come to relax; enjoy the sunsets; listen to the sounds of the waves; in the mornings hear the sounds of animals and taste local food and flavors. The facilities are great even to be located in middle of nowhere. Slow WIFI and cable TV is provided. There are some details they need to improve: like providing more drinking water and advice what food on the menu can be cooked. The food detailed on the menu sounds terrific but depends on the time you sit to have your meals. Sometime during the day you will eat any typical food like"
50,"Great place to stay if what you are looking for is to get away from everything. Location far away from the typical tourist sites, the facilities are amazing.  This is not a luxury resort with buffet and ""eat until you explode"" restaurant, you need to take in mind that it is in a remote location and you get high quality services with basic resources."
50,"We spent four blissful days at this little gem - it is on a deserted beach in the middle of nowhere but you will need nothing else whilst there. Bliss. We felt like we were sleeping on the beach, the sound of the waves was all-pervading which we city dwellers loved. The thatched pavilions are gorgeous, well designed in an effortless luxe beach chic that is difficult to get right. The restaurant is lovely and the food is simple but varies every day depending on what the chef finds in the local markets. But best of all - the staff is absolutely lovely starting with Inigo the manager and the rest of his team. They may not be as polished as one might be used to in other places - but they make up for it with charm and helpfulness. Just don't mention rain...."
50,"Perfection- most beautiful views, gorgeous beach with no one around, perfect pool/bar. Private paradise, rooms are perfect, designed beautifully and smartly. Staff is incredibly nice and service is personalized. Love this place."
50,"This  location can't be beat if you are looking for a place to relax and unwind while having the most incredible views everywhere you look.  We stayed 3 nights in March.  Our room was large, spotless and private with a great king size bed.  One side of each ""palapa"" looks onto the ocean about 100 feet away....doors slide back to a 12 foot opening...on the other side of the room is another  12 foot door that slides back  with a  view of the mountains ....so your ""palapa"" feels like an outside room with a roof.....We used our private pool (every room has one) but mostly stayed near the lap pool....plenty of places to sit in the sun, and in the shade.   I would agree on the one issue...our food the first evening was just great...the next night we think got a little mixed"
40,"We had a great trip. Loved the staff, the hotel and the chill vibe.  However the food needs work big time. Meals were very inconsistent. Because of the remote location you are at their mercy.  Embrace the best of the local would be my suggestion. Leave the salmon to Seattle.  Another look out is the beach is NOT a surf spot.  It is a nasty beach break, that was not only unsurfable but was dicy on a couple of days to even swim in.  That being said the beach is killer, totally remote. and beautiful for a long sunset stroll. Just not a great swimming or even boogie boarding spot.   Renting or having access to a car is a must. Cool stuff to check out near by. Felt safe driving there too.  We were also surprised to see kids staying there. So NOT a kid place. Not only is there nothing"
50,"Had an amazing 4 day stay at Hotel Escondido in mid-February. The hotel is stunning in both its design and setting on the beach. The rooms, pool, restaurant are simply beautiful. The rooms are traditional ""palapas"" or thatched roof huts, made to blend in with the surrounding area, but updated with modern design. Each room has its own plunge pool and hammock, overlooking a cactus garden and the ocean.   Like other reviewers have noted, the best thing is the hotel itself. It's an incredibly peaceful and relaxing place, and it's wonderful to wake up with the ocean only 50 yards away.  Things to note: - the hotel is about 20 miles outside of the main town. This means that the beach is totally private but that you can't walk anywhere besides the beach...you'll need to rent a car or"
50,"What a great place to spend the last days of 2013 and the beginning of 2014! Loved the style and the relaxing vibe.  Dont miss the spa and a horsback ride during the sunset!  Each bedroom has its own private swimming pool in case you dont want to see more people, but I loved the area of the beach club with the huge swimming pool where you can have an amazing ceviche with a mezcal while the sun sets just in front of you!"
50,"I had an amazing experience in Hotel Escondido.  It is a very intimate and exclusive place where the people is extremly welcoming and hospitable. The food is exquisite. The best thing is the hotel itself... decoration is to die for!!! Very comfortable and enjoyable... The pool is a work of art, sand level.... I really felt in paradise. I definitely  did not wanted my vacation to end!!!  NO DOUBT this hotel is a MUST!!!"
50,"I went to Puerto Escondido to relax, Swiss Oasis was a great choice. Only seconds from the beach, had a nice pool, hammocks and kitchen. The owners are very nice and always willing to give honest advice about tours, restaurants and things to do. After traveling around Mexico for a while, it was really nice to take advantage of the local markets, buy fresh food, and use the kitchen (instead of eating out - Puerto has more touristy restaurants too so it worked out well). Unlike other places I stayed in Mexico, where I enjoyed but might look for a new place to stay if I ever went again, I would not look anywhere else in Puerto Escondido. No question I would stay here again. Rooms do not have AC but the rooms have a fan and good breeze - I was never hot. Great wifi too. Want to be"
50,"We enjoyed our stay, it is a small, pleasant and well maintained hotel with a nice swimming pool and It is reasonably priced (We paid $500 in October 2014 for a double room with a kingsize bed) The hosts were very helpful and polite."
50,"The Hotelito Swiss Oasis was just the perfect ingredient for our trip. Coming from Mexico city and Oaxaca we were looking for some chill beach time before we head back into the highlands.  This place didn't disappoint. Nestled just off the main street, with all the services close at hand, we found our oasis. The room was CLEAN and comfortable, the pool extremely inviting and the hostess always happy to disclose local knowledge and make sure you felt at home.  I highly recommend this hotel. Excellent value, fantastic relaxed atmosphere of the beach, with all the comforts required."
50,"We stayed 3 nights, and enjoyed it very much, Fiona was so helpful, she was looking after it, while owners away, as Fiona spoke english, we could ask her heaps, also as we are travelling to Cuba, Fiona gave us information on that as well. rooms were good, with a huge bed, we have a super king bed at home, but think it was even bigger than that, clean, free water, pool was used a lot, as beach to rough to swim in, can recommend."
40,"Descriptions and reviews here on Tripadvisor are accurate: this is an affordable, small guesthouse with a friendly atmosphere that is a short walk to the beach and with easy access to everything around Puerto Escondido. I can't compare it to other places in Puerto Escondido, as it was our first visit, but I was satisfied. Fiona, who was taking care of the place while the owners were on vacation, was friendly, informative, and quite helpful with recommendations, suggestions, and friendly conversation. The place itself is quite relaxed, and I enjoyed sitting by the pool and relaxing between beach and town visits. One concern that is echoed in other reviews is the potential for noise: because of the open windows, and perhaps not terribly thick walls, you may well hear dogs barking"
30,"We planned to stay for three nights and left after one.  For a certain type of traveler, I suppose this could be a great place.  To provide some context, I have traveled with my family in Venezuela, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Guatemala, and now southern Mexico - to name a few.  We have stayed in some very rustic places and hostels and have loved them.  Hotelito Swiss Oasis is not described or held out to the public as such a place.  It turned out to be more hostel and less hotel, but for the cost of a hotel.  It has a nice pool and employs the honor system for water, beer, and soft drinks.  It's not on the beach, but It's not far from the Pipeline and the nightlife of Puerto Escondido.  The hotelito itself is a little compound that is tranquil and quiet (until"
50,"My partner and I stayed in this homely hotelito for three nights which was too short a trip! The family atmosphere, spacious and well decorated rooms but a stones throw from the beautiful beach made a memorable stay. The manager Fiona was simply wonderful. Her knowledge and eagerness to please were second to none.  She routinely went out of her way to help all of the very grateful guests.  "
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed a month at the Hotelito and absolutely loved it! It's got a great vibe and atmosphere but at the same time is tranquil and quiet. The owners Manuella and Rene are so nice and go out of there way to help you, whatever the time of day. The rooms are large, with an en suite and roof fan (which was enough for us), perfect for a couple looking for a nice retreat. The pool area was great for relaxing and the kitchen was so handy to have. if you're looking to party or live in luxury with air conditioning etc this place isn't for you. However if you're looking for a place that gives you quality for money and where you can be guaranteed some relaxation but also a good time, the Hotelito is a great choice. We would definitley stay here again!"
50,"We planned to stay for 3 nights and ended up staying for over 2 weeks. The location was perfect- close to beach but quiet and secluded. The owners could not have been more pleasant, friendly or helpful. They made us feel extremely welcome from the moment we arrived, which was early in the morning after a 13 hr bus ride, until we reluctantly left. With only 8 rooms, it was easy to meet people but also to find a quiet spot by the pool to read and relax. The kitchen was so practical. We were in need of some home cooking by the time we got there. Everything was so, so clean. The pool was a sparkling relief from the heat. Speaking English again was also a blessing. We couldn't recommend Hotelita Swiss Oasis more highly."
50,"A very friendly hotel with everything you need . We loved our 5 nights here and would loved to have stayed longer.  The beds are comfortable, the pool is great and the hotel is only a short walk to nearby restaurants. Manuela and Rene are great hosts and Luna (their dog) and the cats make the hotel like a home."
40,"Great trip over New years.  Grounds are real nice up top where the hotel is. Rooms are small if more then 2 people and no balcony. Clean and well kept.  Beach area is down below and very pretty. The pool is a bit dated but all good. The waves varied from none, to pretty big and crashing abruptly.  Food, no complaints from any of us. A bit repeated, but at a small resort like this is the way it is. Could eat up top breakfast and dinner and down by the pool/beach for lunch.  The up top look out bar was closed a few nights even with its limited hours. Pretty disappointing as this is when the gringos could chat and make plans. All in all bar hours and availabiltiy is my biggest complaint.  Took many cabs into town for the market at principal, and to the zacatela beach for good surf."
50,"Posada Real Puerto Escondido, this is it. Beautiful grounds, staff was friendly, helpful, available, and knows your drink in no time. Spectacular sunsets, the beach at the beach club is wonderful, rocky beach, great waves. The climb back to the hotel could be a workout, and a van is available. Rooms are basic and built for the beach, but who wants to be in the room with so much beauty outside. Yes there seems to be many other hotels in the area, and in town. If you want to feel a little cutoff, sit in a rocker and watch the sunset stay here. Easy to get to town if you want to. A taxi into town is a nice break, and would also suggest a tour mayb two offered at the hotel. I would like to keep it a secret, but Puerto Escondido is beautiful, and I dont surf. Be sure to eat"
20,"Rooms are small and old style: didn't like the secured remote, no in-room safe; if 6ft and taller or bigger size, this is not the place for you. Grounds, pools are beautiful. Food/bar staff are great, front desk speak limited English. On-site travel agency is limited multi-lingual. Ask about real estate and get a fantastic tour of PXM for under $20US."
40,"I have visited the Mayan, Cancun area 10 times but had never been to the Pacific coast of Mexico. I decided on Escondido for 2 reasons, 1 to surf, and 2 because a friend had lived there for 3 years and said it was a great place. The surfing is fantastic with many beaches to try, starting from Zicalito the big break to La Punta for smaller waves. The town is interesting with a old Mexico feel not being overdeveloped. There is hundreds of bars and resturants to choose from and a cab ride anywhere in town is 30 pesos or 3 dollars with cabs everwhere. The hotel is a solid 3 star with food being tasty and if there is not many people staying they go to ordering from the menu instead of buffet which has some good items. The rooms were clean but unfortuneatly have no balconies which"
40,"We had two quiet weeks at the Best Western Posada Real in Puerto Escondido.  Escondar, in Spanish, means hidden, and that it was.  Hidden from the beach vendors who constantly intrude on your enjoyment of beach time.  The hotel is on a cliff, with 103 steps down to the super wide, and long, pristine beach.  A shuttle was available, but we chose to get our daily exercise by doing the climb.  Our flight from Vancouver, at 6:30 AM, arrived in Huatulco at 4:30 PM and the 90 minute bus ride stretched to well over 2 hours.  We arrived at the hotel at 7:30, in the dark, and were advised that a non-smoking KS room was not available, despite having a Best Western member card.  However, we were told that one would be available in 2 days, and this did happen.  We got a well located room on"
20,"Well,  as much as I was glad to be on the ground due to a real shaky landing, I wasnt that impressed when we got there. As soon as we stepped off the plane, we were told that we had a 2 hour van ride through the most twists and turns I've ever been on. Half of the passengers in our van were green within the first 30 minutes of the trip.   When we arrived at the Posada we checked into our room, (which was supposed to be a king bed with a balcony) and it was more like a jail cell. When we went down to the front desk to change rooms they told us that we couldn't change for several days. It was also very hard to communicate with the front desk employess, because they coundn't speak any english. I can undersatnd having the rustic ,old style holiday, but for 3400 hundred dollars I"
50,"We have stayed here in past years and so we were hoping it was a beautiful as we remembered.  It was better!!!  The gounds were immaculate, the hotel has been painted, there were new lawn chairs and more of them.  The staff was basically the same, friendly and helpful with many familiar faces.  January is their slow time and so there were very few people, it felt like our own private resort.  They moved us to the best room in the hotel, with a sweeping view of the lawns, and Pacific Ocean and beach..no extra charge.  Our only complaint was the food, which was never very good, still not much better.  But once you get to know what to order, you can satisfy your hunger.  The chocolate ice cream was delicious and the eggs at breakfast were fine too.  The drinks were ok, not very"
40,"We booked a one week all-inclusive holiday at the Posada Real through Sunwing (a Canadian tour operator) and it was an amazing week, exactly what we were looking for (thanks Trip Advisor reviewers).    (The Sunwing part of the trip (ie the flights) were another story-- delays, chaos etc.)  The Posada Real is peaceful, serene, relaxing, and thus not for those who are looking to party it up.  The hotel was never more than half full our entire week which made for a quiet time.  Our room overlooked the beach and ocean and we could hear its roar through the night.  The hotel itself is perched above a cliff (see photo) with steps or a free shuttle taking you to the beach club below.  The beach club has a great pool, bar, buffet restaurant, and comfy lounge chairs.  The beach itself is"
50,"We have a large family with kids of all ages and there was something to do for all of them.  Volleyball, pool, games, soccer and of course the beach.  The staff was excellent and and friendly to us all.  We could relax on our vacation, enjoy family, and have some quiet time too knowing our kids were safe, being treated well, and having a blast themselves.  Beautiful grounds, good food, clean rooms. "
50,"My husband and I spent 3 nights in Puerto, unfortunately our first night was at a different hotel.  We went to an online cafe close to our other hotel and looked up places to stay in Puerto.  We decided to give the Posada a try, and we are SO glad we did.  It is gorgeous, truly breathtaking, and a great value for a resort.  May is low season, so we easily got a room.  Miguel at the front desk was very kind and told us no problem if we didn't have a reservation. The bellmen, staff, everyone , are so polite and friendly.  Breakfasts are good, and so was the food we had at Coco's beach club down by the ocean.  This is a great hotel for couples and families.  We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary, but when we return, we will bring our kids.  You will love this hotel!!!!!!!!!!! "
50,"I'm not one to write reviews often but our stay with Manfred & Angie @ Christmas this year was worth a mention.  Simple & clean accomodation in a perfect location at one of the better, less busy & more family orientated beaches.  We spent christmas on this beach soaking up the sun drinking beer from the small huts & eating plates of fresh oysters that a local man dives the bay for each day. When we returned to our room before heading to a local seafood restaurant 200 yards from Villa Mozart, Manfred & Angie were waiting with a complementary bottle of wine.  This part of our holiday was one of the highlights & for the price you can't fault the accomodation one bit.   We would definitly stay again, many thanks to Manfred & Angie."
50,"We stayed four nights in the bungalow at Thanksgiving- Manfred was a fabulous host! Bungalow was spacious, unique, clean, complete with two hammocks and two geckos. Also a safe for our passports and fridge for our beers. Several restaurants nearby for eggs, fish and great ceviche.   Very short walk to Playa Carrizalillo.  Would definitely go back, especially to hang out with Manfred!"
50,"My husband and I spent our honeymoon in Puerto Escondido and stayed at the fabulous Villa Mozart. I agree with the previous review, it is everything it says it is and more. We just had a wonderful time. We stayed in the bungalow which I would recommend for a honeymoon. Great privacy and wonderful atmosphere. There is an outside kitchen and we loved using it. There are restaurants nearby which we went to but it was nice to ""stay in"" and cook. We could walk almost anywhere or quickly grab a taxi if we wanted. We walked to our closest beach, Carizallio once a day and then explored the other nearby beaches as well. Manfred and Angie are great hosts. Have great suggestions for ""off the beaten track"" things to do around Puerto. They know the area well and give get advice regarding"
50,"I suppose we were a little apprehensive reserving a hotel based purely on TA ratings. The people who have stayed here and graciously sent in reviews really have it right. We experienced one of our best vacations and would return in a heart beat. Manfred and Angie were superb hosts and did everything possible to ensure our stay was perfect. The 6 suite hotel is close to needed amenities and  the proximity to the best swimming areas make it the perfect spot if you are not into the surfing scene, a 20-25 peso taxi ride will get you anywhere you want to go. Our suite (#6) upstairs was quiet, had good cooking facilities, oodles of hot water and fans that made air conditioning unnecessary. I would mention that on our arrival from the airport to the hotel,  the taxi driver had a"
50,"We staid at Villa Mozart for just 3 nights in October and I must say that everything that's written on the tripadvisor site is absolutely true and this place deserve the rating of 5 stars. It's really amazing how an owner like Manfred can permanently do one thing and just this one thing: Provide this amazing special service. I'm sure that lots of hotel owners, managers and staff members should go there and see the secret of hospitality - at Villa Mozart it happens and we're very gratefull that we could spend some days over there. We'll surely be back. :-)"
50,"I booked the stay after reading reviews on Tripadvisor and was completely satisfied. We were 2 couples and stayed there for 4 nights. We took 2 rooms in the house. The rooms were clean, they provided towels, we had our own balcony, there were en suite bathrooms, bug nets in front of windows, a fan, even a safe in the room. Very good value for money. And I really liked the artwork. As I never believe reviews that are only good so I will also add one bit here that could have been better - the shower temperature did not go to hot and for me it was a bit cool. However, my friends did not see an issue with this and we never talked to the owner about it either. It was so hot outside that a cool shower was needed on most days anyway.   The owner is very friendly and accommodating. We"
50,"We found ""Villa Mozart"" by accident and were definitively surprised by this little oasis. Within a palmtree garden with hovering humming birds, ""Villa Mozart"" consists of one bungalow and a two floor building with four rooms and two appartments. The place is situated right next to the best (smallest and less crowded) beach in Puerto Escondido, Playa Carrizalillo. The right beach to relax and to learn how to surf. ""Villa Mozart"" is run by Manfred from Germany, a very polite, friendly and helpful host who is living in Mexico since years. He knows the surrounding by heart and recommended us good places for day trips (like eg a close laguna) etc.  This place is a must if you look for a tiny, quiet, very clean and beautifully situated place! The prices for rooms are a bargain too."
50,"We had a great time at the Villa Mozart. We  would definitely stay there again. The very nice beach for swimmers and surf-beginners is only 2 minutes away. The Villa Mozart was clean, quite and the house and all the rooms have very nice and lovely decors, all rooms have a safe and the tropical garden with collibris and hammocks is like a peace of paradies. And Manfred, the host, is a very friendly, open-minded german guy, who knows, where to go in Puerto Escondido. Thank you Manfred from the Saarland, we miss you!"
50,Had a great time staying at the bungalow.  Very clean with great decor.  Love the outdoor kitchen so we could have coffee and breakfast while sitting outside.  Manfred the owner is a fabulous host.   He gave us great ideas about where to go etc. for sightseeing plus he's just a great guy.  We always felt completely safe there.  No air conditioning but good fans and there is a safe that you can use.  Just a really nice private place to stay and very affordable too.  I would definitely stay there again.
50,"My husband and I just returned after 3 wonderful weeks in the bungalow at Villa Mozart.  Although not at all fancy or deluxe, it is clean, simple and charming in a quiet neighborhood near a lovely beach, about 2 miles out of town.  Manfred, the owner, was a wonderful host, making sure all our needs were met.   He was the best inn-keeper we have ever had, very personable and warm.  It was the perfect place to unwind and relax, spend hours in the hammock, read, nap and and watch all the tropical birds around.  A little slice of paradise, every day was picture-perfect.  Our kitchen consisted of a refrigerator, 2 burner stove, and all the necessary pots, pans, cups and dishes.  A local baker stopped by weekly with freshly made banana bread and other pastries.  Life was most"
50,"We first stayed at Villas Carrizalillo in early 2013, and then returned in late 2013 to finalize plans for our destination wedding. We held our rehearsal / welcome dinner at Villas Carrizalillo and our wedding at Bacocho beach.  What to say? Villas Carrizalillo has an incredibly friendly staff, idyllic setting, delectable food, and is an absolute heaven.  The owner Amy was unbelievably helpful as we planned our event.  Between friends and family we had the whole B&B rented out for a few days and it was a dream.  We will be returning year after year!"
50,"We spent the end of 2013 and the first day of 2014 here enjoying the delicious seafood at the restaurant, the detail to attention in the well designed villa, and the outdoor spaces to sit, have a drink or swim overlooking the beautiful Playa. It is a beautiful spot away from the traffic of tourists and the beach is gentle and ideal for swimming. The staff were very hospitable and generous with their time and efforts and we will definitely be back."
50,"A delightful 4 days, wish it had been more. Outdoor bar was a small gathering place for some some surfing expats living in area. We stayed in two rooms, both of which were perfect. Only complaint was that our trip could have been longer. Hope to get back."
50,"Great views, delicious food at Espadin and friendly staff. The villa's were homely and we stayed in the one built into the cliff which was great. Short stroll down the stairs to the beach and nice evening deck by the restaurant for cocktails. I highly recommend!"
50,"Our family of four (2 adults and 2 teenagers) stayed in Villa Florencia for 7 days in early August.  Absolutely breathtaking view from our room.  The staff was so nice, reserving a flight back to Oaxaca after a harrowing 8 hour drive down, and getting us local taxis and other services whenever we needed it.  Kitchen is such a plus, and the local supermarket has everything you want.  Some comments: If you pay in cash, you get a 10% discount. The steps going down to the beach can be really challenging in certain areas if you are not physically fit.  More than a notion to have to go back up if you have forgotten something, but the view from your room above is worth it. We ended up spending every day under one of the palm umbrellas in front of the ""snack shop"" closest to the steps. "
40,"We stayed here for a week in August 2013. We were a family of five (youngest 16) and got exactly what we wanted - a week at the beach with practically nothing to worry about. Don't be put off by the approach across a field and an unmade road, once through the gates everything is as it should be. The communal areas are clean, tidy and immaculately kept; the villas are spacious and well appointed; the restaurant and bar are fabulous; the beach is close at hand (though easier on the way down the steps); and the view is to die for. There is a self-catering option, and shops a short walk away. The younger members enjoyed the surfing; the older members enjoyed reading in the sun. The staff were charming and helpful."
50,Me my wife and my two teens stayed here in early June. The place is wonderful and so is the beach view! The photos reflects how beautiful the hotel is but sitting down in the restaurant while having breakfast or a late night drink can't be beat! I think the prices are more than adequate and so are the rooms. Love the kitchen since after being traveling for a while I wanted just some cereal and fruit for breakfast or a sandwich for lunch.  Please remember the place is not a fancy 5 star hotel but if you look at the pics and you are happy with what you see and you want to relax -this is the place- I highly recommend the hotel and I always received attentive treatment from the staff. We also venture into PE and took a taxi everywhere they are very economical. Took the lagoon trip
50,"Playa Zicatela would have been my preference 20 years ago.  While it's still fun to walk down it once or twice (bars, young people, trinket stores) now we want something a bit more sedated.  And with waves that my kids can actually play in.  Have you SEEN the waves at Zicatela?  Looks like more work than fun.  Carrizalillo Bay is the answer for the beach.  The shore was fine even when my youngest was 5, and you can go out a bit further for more rough & tumble.  Local guys offer surf lessons, which my older boy did at 7 and again at 8.  Runs about 250-300 pesos and the classes are pretty good (I took one too; instructors were patient and encouraging despite my miserable lack of ability to stand on the board).  Villas Carrizalillo is the answer for the hotel.  A cab from Zicatela"
50,"Chose this place bc of trip advisor and were far from disappointed.  The staff were ridiculously nice! After our five day stay I left, totally forgetting I had left money in the safe. They emailed my friend (who had made the booking and asked him of it was his and he forgot to mention it to me until two weeks after that. I emailed them eventually and they immediately PayPal'ed the amount which was over $200! Couldn't believe the honesty and integrity.  The food was the best. The chicken and especially the shrimp tacos still follow me in my dreams. Seriously. We ate there for lunch/happy hour every day for those tacos.  I have been meaning to write bout this place for ages. I actually stayed there March 2012 with 2 friends (3 bedroom apt) but haven't gotten around to it. I"
50,"My wife and I spent two evenings at Villa Colorado en this hotel.  We appreciated the attention to detail in every aspect of the premises, but if we had to pick one thing that stood out it would be the view, seeing the light change on Carrizalillo Beach made it feel like our private piece of paradise."
50,"Quiet, comfortable, informal, inspiring. That's what Quinta Lili feels like to me. We stayed just a week ago for the second time in 3 years. Hosts Adelina and Magdalena instantly make you feel at home while catering to your every interest. Arrive from the airport without the proper cab fare? Magda will jump in with a few pesos. Want to liberate turtles? Ade will tell you where and when to go. Want to find out what a tlayuda tastes like? Ade will point you to the best places. Want to try out a new beach? Lots of absolutely beauties to choose from. Bust up your shoulder on a boogie-board digger? Local chiropractor Tom comes highly recommended. Simply put, QL is a treasure within reach of most people's budgets. It's in the nicest part of Puerto Escondido, tucked away in a"
50,"I was lucky enough to spend 5 days in Quinta Lili and 5 days in Villa Lili and I am sad I ever had to leave. The properties are both perfect and set on the most beautiful beach in all of Puerto.   The staff at both villas are wonderful, the breakfasts are delicious and the rooms are spacious and relaxing.   What really makes Quinta and Villa Lili deserving of their top spots on TripAdvisor is the hospitality of Adelina, the part owner and manager of the properties. Adelina is so warm and genuinely cares about the wellbeing of all of her guests. She goes above and beyond at a moments notice and I am now honoured to call her a friend.  Do yourself a favour - book a ticket, get on a plane and get to Quinta Lili as soon as you can. You will not regret it. Hopefully you will see me"
50,"I really recommend this place. We stayed three nights and all we did was to enjoy ourselves. The place is the most peaceful and cleanest ever. The breakfast is delicious and the service outstanding. We could enjoy the pool by our own with relaxing music played by the owner. If you want ro relax this is the place for you, away from noise and cars. Adelina helped us to find really nice tours around Puerto Escondido, guided by expert and professional natives. We didn't have any complain during our stay, we just wish we could have stayed longer. "
50,"This was a truely wonderfull stay. Hotel is located close to the most romantic and beautiful beach in Puerto Escondido in a quiet area of town. Breakfest is great, owner Adeline is more kind of a buddy friend than owner of the place. Rooms are tidy and atmospere is awesome. I highly reccomend this place to all. Thank you Adeline for everything ;)"
40,"We chose Quinta Lili because we wanted to be in walking distance of Playa Carrizalillo a safe, quiet, sandy beautiful beach. We specifically didn't want to be on the surfer beach strip- too busy and commercial.  Adelina, the owner of Quinta Lili greeted us at the airport at 8:00 a..m and quickly whisked us off to her lovely vacation spot. Upon arrival we were served a delicious  2 course breakfast. Adelina went out of her way to make our stay comfortable. Her recommendations for authentic, non-commercial half day trips were all excellent and she herself took care of the arrangements. We enjoyed, too, being able to walk safely at dark to local neighborhood restaurants- all  serving fresh, tasty food.  We'd definitely stay here again if we were traveling to P.E.   Leslie"
50,"Adelina has created a wonderful place to just relax and enjoy the Mexican sun! The location is in a quiet neighbourhood away from the hustle and bustle of Puerto Escondido yet close enough by 25 peso taxi to enjoy the centre of town if that's what you're looking for. Quinta Lili is very clean and comfortable. Breakfasts were always wonderful!! ""Cooksjourney"" has stated it all, so I won't repeat. But all in all, it was a wonderful one week stay!"
50,"What a beautiful place - location, the people, the ambience. Quinta Lili would have to be one of the best places I've stayed at and for all the right reasons - Adelina and her brother Luis have created an environment that is warm, welcoming and simply makes you feel immediately at home. We stayed in the two ground floor rooms that open to the pool. There are three other rooms over two additional levels. All are lovely and have their charms - look at the website and determine your own needs when selecting your room choice - but you really can't go wrong. The beds were comfortable, the rooms spacious and spotlessly clean. The shower was strong. There is an outdoor kitchen and lounge/living area with a tv. A nice bonus is the free, chilled water available all day long. There is an"
50,"I cannot say enough nice things about this place! It is a cute little botique hotel about 15 mins walk from Down town . The room was so nice. We had the top floor which had a private outdoor hot tub , a loft and a huge king size bed. Views were great . Plenty of hot water too. This place has so much character with the comforts of home. Adelina, the host , would have to be the nicest host we have ever had. She spent one night having dinner with us and sharing her Mexican Christmas traditions. Breakfast every morning was great too.At first we were a little worried that it was a bit out from the main drag of Zicatela . But we were soon after very glad that we were , as its easy to get into town if u want but was nice to stay out of town where it's quiet! The beach near the"
30,"Quinta Lil is surely a great place.  But their cancelation policy is brutal and so too was Luis' attitude. I had to pay 2 full nights of 7-day stay  over Xmas holidays in advance.  Entire deposit, more than $750 for three rooms, was non-refundable irrespective of reason for canceling without 30 days notice.  I could not find that policy any where on the website but am sure I must have signed something to that effect.  My wife became ill and could not travel and I notified Luis 12 days in advance that we had to cancel.  In our correspondence, he constantly referred to how this was a disaster for him, and never expressed any concern about my wife's health.  At one point he said there might be an additional penalty over the $770!  He was also very discouraging about renting to"
50,"My husband and I spent a lovely romantic Holiday Season at Villa Lili in 2012/2013. This boutique hotel is beautiful and tranquil, and the staff is exceptional. We stayed in the Exotica room, which has a private hot tub, lots of space for lounging and a superb terrace overlooking the courtyard and pool below with sunset views every night. Wonderful Mexican breakfasts were delicious every morning, prepared by expert chef Irena.  This is a truly special place.  Villa Lili was a really good location as a base for our trip - not too close to the party scene but not too far away in case we wanted to have some fun. It's an easy walk to picturesque Playa Carrizalillo and the Adoquin neighborhood with its restaurants and services. For trips farther afield, proprietors Adelina and Luiz"
50,"We spent five nights at Quinta Lili just before Christmas for our honeymoon and it was just bliss from start to finish. Our mission was relaxation and we certainly got that in this beautiful little boutique hotel. Adelina was on-hand to deal with anything we needed, like booking wonderful tours or chasing up our lost baggage, which was fantastic. Breakfast was delicious and Magda made sure that we were always comfortable in our rooms or by the poolside.  Having our own 'private' beach at Carizalillo, just 10 minutes' (and 165 steps!) away made the whole thing perfect.  We would thoroughly recommend a stay at Quinta Lili and hope to be back there again next year for a longer holiday.  Muchas gracias y hasta la próxima x"
50,"We've travelled extensively all over Mexico and were attracted by a friend's recommendation to Puerto Escondido and Villa Lili for two weeks last year. It was so wonderful we scheduled another two weeks this Feb. Consistently friendly, clean, and safe; fantastic breakfasts, superb swimming, nearby restaurants for traditional Oaxacan food, and superb weather. We've discovered new places to explore and made new friends on each visit.  The owners live with you and treat you like family which provides the consistently excellent travelling experiences, as well as the town's very best Margaritas, which we plan to enjoy again next year."
50,"We spent 4 fabulous weeks in this charming hotel.  The architecture and design details of the rooms and décor are lovely. The breakfasts were absolutely amazing!  Claire, Adelina, Luis and their staff are attentive to every need and are the kindest people you will ever find.  A delight to meet both little Luisa who is an absolute doll and Claire's Mum, Margaret on holiday from Dublin.   We had the most amazing time and met a great group of individuals who became friends in a very short time.  A wonderful atmosphere and good chat around the pool at the end of the day.  We sincerely recommend Villa Lili for a memorable experience you will not want to miss. Thank you to everyone at Villa Lili for the most wonderful four weeks.  Izzy and Gary"
50,"We found this hotel through trip advisor. It is really a gem. It has now two pools, one of them perfect for the kids. The breakfast is simply delicious (various Mexican goodies) as well as continental breakfast and the owners really made us feel welcome. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. We felt so much at home that we ended up staying for over a week. It was the best hotel in all over Mexico. We will miss the lovely food, the friendly atmosphere and the interesting conversations."
50,"This was our second stay at Villa Lili.Two weeks at the end of February.Not nearly enough time to enjoy the relaxed vibe and wonderful hospitality on offer there.The whole staff and Adelina and Claire and Luis were awesome again this year.Breakfast  was fantastic as always.A special treat this year was to have little Louisa and her huge smiley face around to keep everyone entertained.What a beautiful child!Adelina and Claire are so patient and kind,you just want to move in and stay there forever.We love the Rinconada and Playa Carrizalillo.Spend the day at the beach,siesta in the afternoon,cold beers and then a great dinner in the neighborhood,back to the patio poolside for cocktails with the other guests and our hosts.What more could you ask for?We will definitely be back next"
50,"We had a wonderful, relaxing stay at Villa Lili. Claire was very friendly and helpful (she arranged our lagoon tour, which was fabulous). The breakfasts were superb - fresh, varied and plentiful (and, for us, vegetarian :); a big thank you to all Lili's kind staff. The pool was a refreshing alternative to the sea, and having little Luisa there made it even more fun. The beaches are a close walk, as is a long strip of good restaurants. My only advice is to be sure you have really good directions to the hotel (which I thought I had from the website). Our cab driver had a hard time locating it (and maybe didn't understand my less-than-perfect Spanish), no other cab drivers or the policeman knew where it was, and many of the streets and the hotel aren't marked. But once we finally"
50,"My girlfriend and I had a really lovely stay at Villa Lili. The pictures, as good as they are, don't do justice to the place itself. It's very new and super clean and you can see that Luiz, the owner and designer, spent lots of time and love making a place that he'd like to stay in, with lots of little touches that make it a unique place. It's also close to the most beautiful beach in Puerto Escondido, Playa Carrizalilio. Claire made us feel very welcome, answered any and all questions and helped us find the best restaurants, book massages, lagoon kayaking and an endangered baby turtle release, and even helped us locate great locally made mezcal! The kitchen mama, Maria, and her staff made wonderful breakfasts that we enjoyed with other guests sitting around a lovely open-air"
50,"The Villa Lilli is owned and designed by the same folks who run the nearby Quinta Lilli. It's the perfect laidback beach casa, with only a few rooms, all sizable and some with private decks, a pool, and open-air breakfast area serving the best mexican breakfasts around. Staying at the Villa made my trip as a solo traveler. Claire and Adolina were incredibly welcoming and particularly great in helping me plan excursions or just inviting me along. I felt like a part of the family. An easy walk to the beach or the Rinconada.  Highly recommended!"
50,"The private pool, the excellent service and the amazing Mexican breakfast cooked right in front of you were just a few of the highlights of our stay at Villa Lili.  The rooms are huge with plenty of room to spread out and the Villa as a whole is just beautiful!   The staff are so welcoming and make an effort to get to know you so they can make your stay exactly what you want - we had a private tour organised to help release baby turtles into the wild which was by far the highlight of our entire 3 week trip through Mexico.  We accidentally stumbled onto Villa Lili and recommended it to every other traveler we met along the way with rave reviews.   By far the best stay we had while on our holiday.  Thank you Villa Lili!"
50,"What a wonderful time we had in Escondido, and Villa Lili was the secret ingredient!  Service - Clare was a wonderful host and she and her team made us feel very welcome.  They looked after our every need in a warm yet effortless manner.  Room - our room was large, very comfortable and super clean.  It had everything we needed and we had a fantastic view of the ocean.  Location - Villa Lili is located near Carrizalillo beach, which is a great beach for swimming.  It is a short walk to Boulevard Benito Juarez where there are a number of nice restaurants, bars, cafes and a surf school.  It is also a short, easy (and very cheap) cab ride to other parts of Puerto Escondido.  Food - Every morning, we were treated to a different, delicious Mexican breakfast by the pool.  What a great"
50,"All I have to say is that our stay at Paraiso Escondido was THE BEST!, don´t look or take seriously the bad reviews i think they are from the competition REAL and PURE ENVY, the reasons they give are so, so non sense, One want his/her dog in, ahhhhh???? are you Paris Hilton??? and what about the other guests that don´t want dog smell or noise in the rooms??? the cocodrile as far as I no, the manager safe him from a man that want it to make him boots!!! the price ????ice??? water??? buy yours they daily put one bottle is more than fair, in other hotels they will charge you 8dlls per bottle in the room, ( a super CHE is in front) did you noticed it???? the person needs another type of vacation he / she wants VEGAS HOTELS at Puerto Escondido hahaha, no really it´s all a bad and sad"
30,"Recently stayed at the Paraiso Escondido and found the hotel a little run down since our last visit.  To be fair, we haven't stayed here in a number of years but the room was overpriced for what we got.  We booked the largest suite on the top floor for an entire week, but after the first few days we were ready to checkout.  The private pool was not kept full nor cleaned.  The air conditioning was not working and there are still no decent lounge chairs around the pool for guests to enjoy.  Serigo is a very nice person and so is the staff, but until the hotel makes some improvements it's doubtful we'll stay here again."
50,"No, this is not the Four Seasons Hotel like the previous reviewer expected, although you would expect the price might have given them a clue. We stayed a month for what an up-scale hotel would charge for 2 or 3 days! Perfect central location, super clean, large rooms, A/C, pool and free internet hookup so we skyped home regularly. Good restaurant and helpful service from Sergio made this a wonderful vacation. Lots of stairs (no elevators) but if that does not scare you, then this is an oasis. Get a top floor suite if you can, the shared kitchen was great."
40,"I t ravelled with my family with 2 teenagers,they had the villa I (Grandmother) had my own room in main part of hotel The whole place is really charming comfortable with a real Mexican flavour.I thought I would miss staying right on the beach but this hotel was such an oasis with a great pool lots of lounging area lovely staff  always smiling and close enough to the beach but away from the hordes I really loved it .I had been to PE a few times previously but the feel at Paraiso definitely made it the best! Bonnie  Vancouver Canada"
50,"I can only repeat the praises contained in the earlier reviews. We had a suite with a shared kitchen. The rooms are very large and bright and the balconies are huge with the most gorgeous view. The swimming pool is large and always kept in pristine condition. The shared kitchen is well equipped. The staff are very polite and helpful and the owner, Sergio, quickly looked after every request we made. It is only a 5 minute walk to the resturant strip, to the beach or to the large supermarket in the upper town. Every guest we met was very pleased the accomodation and many were repeat visitors. The hotel is very quiet and peaceful."
50,"This hotel was a fantastic find.  My husband and I stayed here on a recent trip, and loved the unique style of the hotel and the quiet and tranquility of the grounds.  Everyone who worked at the hotel was incredibly nice, friendly, and accomodating.  The rooms were clean, with lovely balconies - ours overlooked the pool with a view of the ocean.  Between the ocean view, AC, pool, easy parking, and pretty grounds, this hotel is a great deal.   There's also a great pizza place just around the corner that I definitely recommend! My only challenge with this hotel is that it truly is ""escondido"" - a little hard to find.  But that is also what makes it a treasure, and I recommend it highly to anyone interested in staying in place that is unique and a wonderful place to just laze about"
40,"If you want to visit Puerto Escondido in México, for surfing or just leisure, you have to go to Paraiso Escondido Hotel. Every corner is full of details, the decoration is beautiful and the hotel is very quiet day and night; also very clean. You can go to the balcony to watch the beach, the sunset or the moonlight. The hotel is a block from the main street in Puerto Escondido: ""el Adoquin"", the beach is a few steps down the street. We spent a delightful vacations with my teenagers (11, 15 & 17) who loved learning surf in ""la Punta"" beach. While they were taking lessons, my husband and I enjoyed delicious meal at the beach. You will not be dissapointed."
50,"I'm afraid if I give all the kudos this hotel deserves I'll never be able to get another reservation - it will be booked solid. This is the Mexico I love - no big resorts for me. The architecture is charming, Sergio and the staff so friendly and helpful, the food delicious and the location perfect. The rooms are lovely and ever so quiet and the beautiful pool an oasis on a hot afternoon. A friend and I were on our way to join a tour from Oaxaca and this was to be a relaxing few days which turned out to be better than we ever hoped. We took Gina's walking tour and that, too, is not to be missed.  I am hoping to be back soon with all my family."
50,"The hotel is a gem. Well maintained colonial style, large, quiet rooms, lovely grounds and view -- away from it all. The pool is a great place to louge during the hot afternoons. The service is also first rate -- friendly and helpful staff. I highly recommend it."
50,This is our second stay in this hotel and this time we stayed a week. We again were charmed by its character and atmosphere and magnificent view of the bay and both beaches from the upper rooms. It is only a few minutes walk to the beach and its restaurants & it is very close to the new pedestrian overpass that leads into town uphill. The pool was clean and cool and the AC quiet and cool. The staff was friendly and helpful. An ATM is just few steps away. We will stay again...
50,"This is a great place to stay if you want to do your own cooking sometimes, be a block from a beautiful beach and avoid the Marriotts of the world. Variety of suites and wonderful hosts. The room at the top has the best views, but a little smaller. My favorite for romance."
30,"We stayed for one week. Very good room with a fully equiped kitchen. The location is not the best, as it is not too close to either the main beach in Zicatela or the ""punta"", it is somewhere in between. Highly recomend it for families who want to stay in the hotel or if you don't mind doing some long walking or taxis to main beaches.   The staff were quite nice, although one of the things that made us decide to stay in this hotel was the free Yoga classes, sadly the two times we went to take it there was no class, and there was no explanation given for this. We did not make a fuss because it felt contradictory to make a fuss about no Yoga class, but did find it strange that there was no explanation for this.  Also, there is a vegan menu (smoothies and a couple of other dishes)"
50,"We enjoyed our 3-night stay here. Staff were friendly & helpful. We were upgraded to a larger suite because it was still early December & not too busy. Rooms were very spacious and the kitchens were very well equipped. Ample drinking water was supplied. Showers were great and hot water was present at all times. The beds were firm but comfortable and had lots of pillows. We had restful and quiet sleeps. Lots of storage, hangers an hooks were available to hang things on. Housekeeping was great too. The grounds were very nice. We didn't use the pool (we were at the beach nearby). Can't comment on the yoga classes because they weren't available during our stay. Overall, we had a really nice time & would consider staying again as they also offer discounts for returning customers :)"
50,"We were supposed to stay 2 nights but the staff were so welcoming and the hotel (room, swimming pool, yoga,...) so great that we stayed 7 nights.  The sea it's just at 100meters. If you have the chance that the Owners  ( Will and his wife  are there you may have the chance to be invited to see the sunset at they rooftop. "
50,"... only to try and discourage other people from blowing up this utterly perfect spot, but I reckon that would be unfair to the spirit of this site.  The suites are lovely, big, and comfortable with stocked kitchens. For us, even the plethora of fans wasn't enough to cut the humid heat, though, and we splurged on the powerful AC option. A little spendy, but worth it.  We had a late bus departure, and were permitted to use a shower and other facilities during the day while we waited, which was a nice touch.  At first, I wasn't sure how I felt being so far away from town and Zicatela, but this turned out to be infinitely better than the alternative. The place was very sleepy and a short walk from sleepy Punta Zicatela, which had everything else we needed. Bring cash, though, as"
50,"Great rooms, a fantastic pool. Free yoga with a excellent teacher. Great cooking facilities, great location; walking distance to the beach or La Punta for bars and restaurants or a cheap short cab ride from the main beach. Also great value for money and helpful staff. An absolute gem. "
40,"We stayed there for three nights during the off-season and almost had the place for ourselves, which always helps. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the staff is very friendly and competent, and the beach is only a few blocks away. The local touristic infrastructure is fortunately not too highly developed, but you neeed a car to get to downtown Puerto Escondido. Guided tours are offered to a nearby lagoon, a nature preserve with alligators and birds - they are worth taking."
40,"Very nice and well priced hotel/suites on the edge of town but only a 45min walk along to the beach to the main surfers beach or a cheap taxi ride to the centre. If you are looking for a quiet getaway, this is the place for you!! Very friendly and helpful staff, it's the perfect place to relax, read a book or two and take it easy!"
50,"This resort is a peaceful and beautiful place to stay. Very comfortable, hospitable and the grounds are lush and well-kept. The rooms are well stocked w everything you need. Very much enjoyed the bottled water and full size fridge and freezer. Loved all the tile and stone details in our room. We will definitely stay here again when we return w our family. This time my son and I were here w a large group. Loved it and can't wait to return!"
50,"We stayed at Casamar for several days and had a wonderful time! It is close to the rest of the town, has great recommendations on tours, has yoga and exercise dance classes right upstairs, a ping pong table and more! There isn't any food or anything right in the resort, but our suite had a very nice kitchen that we enjoyed cooking our own food in. Just ask and they can provide a whole list of restaurants too! The rooms were clean and relaxing (The bed was hard, but I actually slept very well on it!), the hammocks were comfortable, the pool was just amazing, and the beautiful flowers were just a joy to see! If you have questions while your there just ask! The staff is very nice, the beach is one block away, and the city of Puerto Escondido is great and has many nice beaches and"
50,"All condos, from bachelor to four-bedroom.  Two beautiful swimming pools, right on the beach.  Great restaurant and small store available to stock up.  Shuttle available to airport and shopping.  Great place for family vacation."
50,"I had the pleasure of staying here for the past two weeks and enjoyed the Vivo Resort immensely!  The units are fully equipped and we were able to stock up the kitchen using the shuttle bus to the store. The restaurant on site has a limited but tasty menu with very reasonable prices if you don't feel like cooking.  It was fun to go to the Puerto Escondido beaches but nice to have a quiet home to go back to. The wildlife was spectacular and we saw whales, dolphins and rays jumping almost every day!  Great memories! Thanks Vivo!"
50,"We enjoyed an incredible family vacation to Vivo. The 2 bedroom grandview suite was so beautiful and spacious, the mountain and ocean views were incredible. The restaurant and bar staff were so friendly and the food...so tasty!! Anyone searching for an elevated experience beyond the typical Mexican all-inclusive resorts, Vivo is definitely worth trying."
50,"We spent 11 nights at Vivo. We booked Casa Paz for our stay,  The place was incredible,  3 ;large bedrooms private pool and right on the ocean.   There was a onsite caretaker that cleaned the house daily and did laundry.   When we arrived they had no idea about our arrival and that our villas was not yet ready.  It was 4pm and check in was 3pm.  We finally got to our room at 5:30.  They did get us lunch and a few drinks while we waited but he had to demand it.  I had emailed the day before and we were told we can check in anytime since there was no one in occupying the villa.   The beach was unspoiled and clean,   there was no one anywhere around.   If you are looking for a party place this is not the resort. Food at the hotel was pretty good we ate most of our meals daily at"
10,"The employees over charge for everything, even a pack of sugar! They wanted to charge me 4000 pesos for a vase that was accidentally broken. Then they tried to bargain because I refused to pay the ridiculous amount.  Never again!"
50,"If you want to get a feel for the real Mexico, including fabulous food and warm friendly people you have to explore this town. We stayed at Vivo Resorts and couldn't say enough good things about the whole experience. We stayed in a huge one bedroom unit overlooking the pools, mountains and ocean. We saw an incredible number of dolphins, whales and even hatching turtles. We will be back for sure."
40,"Friends invited us to stay at there condo.  Excellent staff and relaxing atmosphere. Wish the ocean was a bit tamer so we could go in  - was under red flag the whole week. Some comments/suggestions that come to mind for improvement:  - Pool. Volleyball pool was developing an algae problem leading to water bugs making a home. My wife, son and I all got bitten by them once and it hurts like hell. Used to lifeguard and maintain a pool, made we wonder if there was enough chlorine being used - I couldn't smell a hint of it. - Shower. Drainage was a problem, as we showered the floor filled up a couple inches of water. Water pressure was very good. - Beds. Very firm, a bit too firm. Also wish there was a heavier comforter. - Fridge. Power had gone out at sometime and the butter that"
50,"This is our second stay here and love the resort..just what we were looking for.  Beautiful beaches and pools, great food, quiet relaxing atmosphere.  We saw whales and dolphins standing on the beach.  Did the laguna bioluminensce tour which was amazing, and went to several local beaches.  An amazing trip!!"
20,"Staff were very friendly but lack service skills, terrible experience in all areas regarding service. They were kind but poorly organized (restaurant, room service, pool bar, check out). Too bad it is so bad because the rooms and overall hotel facilities are very nice. Poor service almost ruined our vacation. "
50,"Just came back from two weeks in paradise. Vivo Resorts has everything going for it, from an ocean full of life to beautiful suites.  During our amazing visit we saw whales, dolphins, jumping sea rays, turtles and three baby turtle releases in front of the resort.  Food was spectacular, always tasty and fresh. Can’t say enough about the special friendly staff who would not hesitate to go out of their way to help.  We had a chance to see the New Club House that opens December 15th, this will be the focal point of the resort with a restaurant, sports bar, world class spa, exercise room and a banquet palapa with views to die for.  Will definitely return!!"
50,"Great location in the middle of playa Zicatela, just off the road to avoid noise. Lovely owner was very helpful. We even rented her scooter for a day to explore nearby towns and beaches. Nice clean rooms. Coolest spot without air con in town (air con seems very rare and a lot more expensive, even in the hottest month of the year, we were comfortable). Cheap cold water and beer for sale and a beautiful pool in the immaculate gardens which produce free mangoes and bananas. Highly recommend!"
50,"Well it is my third year in a row coming back to stay here at the oasis. It is more beautiful than ever. The gardens are filled with bright colours and fruits bananas galore. As always Manuela and Rene go out of their way to make your stay perfect. The rooms are big, cool, clean, quiet. I have spent plenty of hours studying by the sparkling pool and meeting the other guests who all seem to have wonderful stories of their travels from all over the world. I cannot recommend staying here high enough. I so look forward to returning as soon as possible."
50,We travelled Mexico for 6 weeks over the Christmas period and stayed in many many different types of accomodation from 5 star to 2 star and this place was by far our favourite. We were welcomed with open arms and felt at home straight away. The comfort and energy of this hotel is something special. I have worked as a manager in a 5 star resort in Bondi beach Australia for 10 years and I know the industry inside and out and I can't give this hotel and the owners enough praise as to how they operate their hotel and treat their guests. They went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. There is so many places to chose from in puerto escondito and I am sure we found the best. We will most definately be back and can only give my biggest praise and recommendation of this hotel.
50,"Fantastic location, a few meters back from the Main Street at playa zicatela. Rooms are Very clean and the staff are friendly.   The pool is great and the rooms are good value. A nice quiet place to relax in the sun.  "
50,"Great little hotel with friendly and helpful owners. Everything is well tended and there are some lovely little touches, e.g. an honesty system fridge for drinks, a small kitchen you can use, 'free for all' shelf in both kitchen and for general items (sunblock, toiletries), magazine & book collection. You'll also love the cheerful colours everywhere. There is a nice pool area, plenty of shade and blissfully quiet as the hotel doesn't accept children. The rooms are clean and with good fans. This is the hottest time of the year and it was fine (admittedly we used the fans for 4 people with only 2).  The only point of criticism would be that the hotel only accepts cash and cash machines in P.E. proved very unreliable during our stay. So my general advice would be: stock up on cash"
40,"Rooms are clean, wifi is reliable, but you can find this at many places in Puerto Escondido or Zicatela for much less money.  Do you need a pool?  If you do, then you can stay here and pay extra for it, or you can walk 50 metres to the beach and sit under an umbrella.  The pool/office/common area are all right in front of the rooms, so privacy is very limited and the slightest of noise will easily awaken you.  There is too much jammed in on this small property.  The owners are nice, but it feels like you're staying at their house- again, a privacy thing.  They have beers for sale for 15 pesos, about 5 more than the store 20 meters away."
40,"Small hotel down a side street off the beach.  If you are looking for glamour, or a view, this isn't the place.  However, if you want a very clean, safe, room where everything works that has a wonderful shower, at a good price, this will definitely do it for you."
50,"We stayed here for a week whilst travelling around Mexico and it lived up to the reviews on Trip Advisor. It was a place to totally relax and find calm, but only a minute away from the beach, bars and cafes. The owner gave us  great information about places to visit and we liked the little kitchen where we could prepare our own food bought at the market. Being small the hotelito has a homely charm and a personal touch. Good value for money."
50,I stayed at swiss oasis in october of 2013 and had a wonderful experience. The rooms are put together well and kept clean by the outstanding house keeping staff. The owners are extremely nice and helpful. Not to mention it is situated 30 steps from playa zicatela. Stay at hotelito swiss oasis and you will not be disappointed.
40,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at this hotel on Zicatela Beach.  The staff and other guests contributed to our our enjoyment.  The common kitchen had all the necessarily facilities, and was kept clean by other guests as well.  The ceiling fan was completely adequate for our downstairs room.  The rooms are well thought out, for example, we could leave clothes to dry on hooks in our patio area outside the room, and the shower drained nicely, such that the bathroom floor did not get wet.  We would come back here."
50,"My spouse and I spent 10 days at the Posada Real in Puerto Escondido and loved every minute of our stay.  The hotel is perched of a cliff overlooking the Pacific with spectacular vistas and sunsets. At the beach level, a restaurant,large pool, and bar will have you staying on the beach all day in the shade of a palm grove. Great place to relax.  The rooms were good,albeit a bit dated,and very clean. Food was also good with excellent service.  The town offers a lot of variety in shopping,restaurants,nightlife, and has various beaches to explore.  All in all, a very enjoyable vacation. Our sincere thanks to Alberto and his staff for making our stay a pleasure. "
40,"We are just back from an 'all inclusieve' week at the Posada Real. Loved the hotel and the town.  Hotel has beautifully kept grounds and overlooks the best beach and sunsets we've seen in Mexico.  The hotel Beach Club is perfect place to read, swim (in pool or ocean) or collapse. Guests should know the hotel, beach club and beach are separated by steps that take about 5 minute to climb.  We and other guests never found them a problem and the brief exercise served to burn a few calories that helped offset any overindulgence. Auto shuttle is available  Food is excellent, as is the staff though would be helpful for us unilinguists if more had some English.  However Alberto, the manager, has fluent English and was very helpful to us with arrangements. The hotel is a 30 minute walk"
50,"I stayed here in June which is the low season in PE. Having booked two nights, I quickly decided to stay for the full ten days of my vacation. The hotel is located on a cliff with a large well maincured lawn shaded with palm trees overlooking the Pacific Ocean and a long deserted sandy white beach -Playa Bacocho. The hotel also has a beach club on the above mentioned beach with a pool, restaurant and bar that is reached by a shuttle or a short walk.  The hotel lobby is a colonial style breezeway with a bar and there is a restaurant downstairs serving excellent food overlooking the another pool and the lawn. All said,  the grounds are simply beautiful and the service was very attentive and friendly (I was actually able to watch a Yankee game at the bar one evening.) and there was"
50,"I just got back from a vacation at the Posada Real in Puerto Escondido where I had a fabulous, relaxing, blissful stay.    The staff were so genuinely friendly that they made it feel like a home away from home.  The food was excellent and the surrounding scenery was breathtaking.  Access to Coco's Beach just below the hotel on a stretch of paradise on earth was more than an added bonus. There was a pool and bar on the beach also.  The dining area looked out onto the grounds and the pool area to make dining an even more pleasant experience.  The hotel pool had warm water to cool you while you could have a snack or cocktail poolside.  The grounds were meticulously manicured and the butterflies that fluttered all along the hotel perimeter hedges were a delight.  The hotel is"
40,"After pouring over my ""Fodor's Mexico"" I chose to visit Xitapa/Zijautanejo  because it is smaller than it's neighbor Acapulco.  June is in the off season, so I decided to stay in the Ixtapa resort hotel strip.  The hotel Posada Real (Best Western) is a modest three story hotel right on the beach.  The staff were all very professional and friendly.  The room was cleaned daily and the folded wash clothes were adorned with a hibiscus, or some other flower.  This simple daily flower in a fresh wash cloth came to symbolize the friendly hospitality I recieved throughout my visit to the area.  The prices for meals were comparable to any hotel in an excellent location in the US.  To save money, I took a taxi to the local grocery store in Zijuatanejo (""El Comercial"")  The hotel pool was"
40,"We stayed here a couple years ago and liked it well enough to return.  The rooms could stand a little renovating, but everything else is fine--restaurants, pools, beach area, grounds--all enjoyable and good value."
40,"Beautiful grounds, WARM water in beautiful swimming pools, great beach area with pool, ocean and towel-side service of food and drinks. Shaded tables on beautiful,soft sand. Relaxing and quiet; swim, sleep, eat, drink -it's all there. Back for the third year in a row. Rooms ok, but good enough for a shower and air-conditioned sleep..with cable tv. and totally inexpensive. Don't tell too many people."
30,"We were in Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, Mexico, several years ago and have trying to get back ever since.  Wonderful, warm destination.  Stayed at Posada Real.  Was okay, but wouldn't stay there again.  Too remote.  Would stay downtown or on Zicatla Beach.  Be sure to visit Gina Machorro at her tourist information booth downtown and accompany her on her walking tour of the town and visits to local homes.  She speaks excellent English and is a terrific person."
50,"What can I say? Is this the closest thing to the perfect budget accommodation? Ok so the curtains are a little see-through and some might find the art ( yes art !) in the rooms a little disconcerting.  But an owner who is so passionate about what he does... the other reviews did not exaggerate. Perfectly clean (which Manfred also does himself when someone leaves on one of the days the cleaner doesn't come!), perfect restaurant suggestions, the option of short or long stay (if he has any room) and interesting, friendly people staying there without an intrusive or noisy atmosphere. All I can say is go and have a look, you won't regret it."
50,"I've just returned from a wonderful 6-night stay at the Hotel Villa Mozart and Macondo.  I was vacationing in Mexico with my 6 year old son and landed at the Villa Mozart because of the reviews I read here on Trip Advisor.  Having stayed at a somewhat high end hotel in Oaxaca, my first impression of the Villa Mozart was a bit skewed on the ""it's going to be a long six days"" side.  (If you're looking for a 5-star, air-conditioned, luxury linen, sprawling eternity pool hotel property in Puerto Escondido then the Villa Mozart is not for you.  However, if you're looking for a charming, peaceful, and welcoming hotel in Puerto then this is the place for you.)   After meeting the hotel manager and co-owner, Manfred, my intial trepidation began to subside.  Manfred was kind and"
50,"A short walk to the best beach in puerto escondido, great restaurants close by, friendly owner, all in all a great experience. ( i didnt want to leave!) we looked all over for accomadation and this was by far the best. its away from the hustle and bustle and has so much character.  we will stay there again for sure.  and manfred if you are reading this ...a big hola from jessica and mike!"
50,"It is a small and atmospherical place situated very close to the best swimmingbeach in Puerto Escondido. It is also close to a stretch of restaurants, however, away from the partystrip of Zicatela. Villa Mozart has great offers for budget travellers. Apartment, bungalow and rooms. It is very clean. The rooms are decorated with beautiful and decorative art. The host, Manfred, is very helpful and friendly. The place has a quick wireless internet connection."
50,"This is a charming and restful place to be. Ten minutes walk from a lovely little sheltered bay. The highest quality for the cheapest price. We stayed in the garden bungalow with its little al fresco kitchen for $35.00 a night. (Low season)There are also two rooms available and two apartments. The German host Manfred couldn't be more helpful as he works daily on his garden-- a poem-in-progress where you can watch birds build their nests, become mesmerized by the sharp shadows the palms cast as you listen to music or rock back and forth in a hammock. Close to stores and restaurant. James Keller "
50,"We discovered the Villa Mozart on Trip Advisor as well as other sites and were taken by the stellar reviews, great photographs, and affordable prices. We booked a few nights for our honeymoon to arrive the only guests onsite. We were greeted by Manfred, the friendly inkeeper, and got to see each room and take our pick. We chose the bungalow separate from the rest of the hotel. It was quite spacious and very clean, with detail oriented decor, and a nice outdoor kitchen and personal hammock. Manfred was very personable and gave us great tips about where to go and what to see. The hotel itself is just a few steps away from Playa Carizalillo, a beautiful, swimmable, even surfable beach away from the crowd. We spent time on the patio of our bungalow surrounded by a beautiful garden"
50,"The Villa Mozart is a small and peaceful hotel comprising two apartments, four ground floor studios and two bungalows,each with its own unique and artistic touch. The apartments and the bungalows have good cooking facilities. The hotel, only two minutes from the Pacific Ocean, has a beautiful tropical garden, very appropriately named Macondo. There are many good quality places to eat just seconds away from the hotel. The Villa Mozart offers wireless access to internet.  "
50,Once again I spent some time at The Villa Mozart and to my great surprise it now has a fantastic little bungalow in the garden. With an outdoor kitchen ! There is a very colourful painting on the wall...purple monkies ! Hence the name Changa ( Mexican for monkey it seems) I loved  the time I have spent here in Puerto and at the Villa Mozart. and I shall certainly be back again . 
50,"The Villa Mozart is a nice, relaxed and friendly Apartment Hotel with a big Tropical Garden and is located just 100 meters away from the beautiful Carrizalillo Beach. I´ve stayed there in the beginning of 2007 for a couple of weeks (my first time in Mexiko) and got stuck there right away! It has the perfect combination of everything: It is close to the beach, the rooms are very clean and quiet and it is close to lots of shops and restaurants. It has only 6  Apartments and a Bungalow and is not very well known, but if you are looking for a relaxed and family like Atmosphere, I truely can recommend this Place! I´ve spend my best time in Mexico there and if I go back, this is the Place where I´m gonna be. On top of it all you get everything for a fair price and the Owner is very"
50,"Excellent facilities in a spectacular location. This charming little hotel is blessed with friendly staff and a fabulous beach just a few steps below (all right, it's more than a few steps; it's a steep hill serviced by a concrete staircase but it'll improve your fitness!). Liked everything about it, especially the view from my room (Villa Florencia)."
50,"We had a fantastic experience at this hotel. From the welcoming staff, to the stunning views and sunsets, to the delectable, world-class food, we will absolutely be back. We extended our stay by a night because we loved this location so much.  The hotel overlooks Playa Carrizalillo, a palapa-lined, small, very chill beach with incredibly calm and crystal clear waters.  We came to Carrizalillo as we were scoping out a location for our wedding and fell in love with Puerto Escondido.  Highly recommended that you visit for a multiple night-stay, for a meal, or for just a drink at sunset... you won't regret it!"
50,"Our retreat. Our home away from home. Sitting out on the balcony of the Villa Puebla, the only order of the day is what sunset cocktail we'll make. The instant you set foot on the grounds of the Villas Carrizalillo, you are instantly relaxed. The wonderfully appointed grounds, the pool for cooling off in, the views down to the beach, the Villas can do no wrong in our eyes. The lovely ktichenettes have all the right tools to get the job done: from coffee maker,refrigerator and blender to stove and toaster oven, and for the foodie in our house, every morning we dart out to the local market and stock up on local produce and seafood so we can enjoy comida on the beach or on the patio.  The Villas also makes a superb mezcal, Fidencio, and is available for purchase at the desk or at"
40,"Fantastic cliff top setting - perfect for sundowners and the food in restaurant Espardin was remarkably good with some inventive twists on traditional Mexican favourites.  The rib eye was amazing, have never had beef so good in Mexico."
50,"We stayed6nights in this delightful small hotel perched over a perfect beach,with the best sunset views I ever saw.our room had all mod cons ,including endless bottled water(something all good hotel rooms should have)the restaurant is operated by an outside operator ,and was outstanding.we only ate one meal out,and decided there was no reason to leave to leave paradise! Service was excellent , even the music was great."
50,"Puerto Escondido is a sleepy little town on the southern Pacific coast of Mexico. It has not yet been discovered and developed like Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta and so on. Villas Carrizalillo is a small-midsized boutique hotel built high on a cliff overlooking a beautiful beach and bay. The website photos do it justice. The restaurant is very good, the rooms are air conditioned and clean, the staff is friendly and helpful. You can get just about anywhere in town by taxi for about US$2. Vendor palapas on the beach sell beer, food, and snacks. Surf, SUP, and snorkel equipment and lessons are available on site and three SCUBA nearby operators offer diving. PE has an airport and the flight from Mexico City takes about 90 minutes. if you want a quiet Mexican beach that is not overrun"
50,"This is a great boutique hotel, overlooking a spectacular beach. If you aren't a hardcore surfer, this is the beach you're looking for in Puerto Escondido. The beach is a short walk down private steps.  The rooms were true to their pictures on the website. Take some time to look through all of the rooms. We stayed in Terrazza -- which has a great patio complete with hammocks.   The on-site restaurant was great. The hotel staff was attentive and usually helpful. There is also a small on-site pool which was nicely maintained. We were only there for three nights, and basically didn't leave the hotel.   This place was also a really good value. If they were located in a place with a slightly higher flow of American tourists, they could charge at least double.   We did have a problem"
40,"We just stayed 9 days in this hôtel. The location is great, over looking the best beach of Puerto Escondido. Also the service is very friendly and attentive. Rooms are spacious and clean. We Will definitely come back"
50,"We had an amazing time in Puerto Escondido and at Villas Carrizalillo.  I will confirm what other reviewers have said--some at long length--that this is beautiful property that is staffed with friendly people, professionally run, provides clean, well appointed suites, and boasts a great location (steps from town and private stairs to the small swimming beach).  With all of that, it also somehow pulls off a rustic but lavish vibe.  We stayed in the Villa Colorada. Truly, the pictures of the views and establishment pale in comparison to the reality.   I absolutely would feel lucky to make a return trip."
50,"Don't be alarmed as your vehicle enters the back entrance to the Villas, down the heavily rutted road, recently washed out by Ernesto.  Concerns of all sort will pass through your mind but in minutes, you will arrive at the beautiful, secluded, cliff-top villas, and have no doubts about the wisdom of staying here.   Immediately on entering the gates to the villas, one realizes that these are the two worlds of Mexico as they appear all over the country.  The rutted, gutted road that passes very small, very rustic habitations, and leads to walled gardens and beautifully manicured, classic comfort.  The pobre and the fino ... the rustico and the rico.     The gardens and villas are maintained in top condition.  For anyone who cares even a little about tropical flora, there is much"
50,"Amazing small boutique hotel, only 5 rooms which ensures a quiet and relaxed stay. Close to an equally amazing playa, albeit with a few stairs to climb but worth it once there. freshly caught oysters. There,s also and cool off pool and they let you use the kitchen when you need to make margaritas. Adelina is a warm, giving and informative host. She pretty much knows all that you need to know and is always helpful. Great breakfasts by Magda and her. Rooms are spacious and clean. We spent 6 days there. Wish it was longer. There is a reason it is rated 5 stars."
50,"Words can not describe the idyllic experience I had staying in this small piece of paradise. Scrumpous breakfasts every morning served up Magdalen, then a short walk to my Spanish lessons around the corner, another coffee in Cafecita, a stroll to Carizalillo beach down the road...everything was within walking distance. I would return to Quinta Lilli for a cool dip in the pool and sit back under the outdoor palapa and toast myself with a glass of wine for choosing the nicest place in Puerto Escondido to stay in. Adelina  the manager, became my best pal and she introduced me to the real side of Puerto. She even signed me up for salsa classes. I loved this place so much I went to try Villa Lilli for a few nights as well. It was just as spectacular. I ended up staying for 2 weeks. I"
40,"We forgot to get directions before arriving in Puerto Escondido and the place is a bit off the radar. Asking for directions isn't much help either because most locals haven't heard of the place. The house is very nice and quiet, but a bit isolated also. The Villa Lili is the main property and I think I would stay there if given the option next time. Quinta Lili is very quaint and nice. We had no problems with our room, the breakfast was fantastic and the staff was really helpful and outgoing . There is no internet at this location but there are several nearby establishments with free wifi so it wasn't a big deal. Our best day of our trip in Oaxaca happened as a result of Adelina's recommendation to visit the nearby lagoon. We kayaked, saw amazing birds, had a private beach"
50,"Originally we planned to stay at Quinta Lili for three nights, but after the first 2 nights we decided we simply could not stay anywhere else, so we extended our stay to 6 nights.   The hotel is stunning, so pretty, quiet and clean. We stayed in both rooms on the ground floor (we had to move because we extended our stay), and both were beautiful.   Adelina and her staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, by the end of our stay we felt like we were staying with family! On our first morning Adelina gave us a map and marked restaurants and other things we might be interested in, which was a huge help!    Breakfast at Quinta Lili was one of our favourite parts of our trip, it was so nice to wake up to fresh coffee, fruit, and traditional Mexican cuisine.   As others have"
50,"Where to start... yep everything was better than we could have imagined. The Staff was the biggest difference, when you are in a new place some local advice goes a long way. At Quinta Lili they go above and beyond to cater Puerto Escondido to what you are looking for. We walked away with a friend, who was our host. Adelina TOOK us to her favorite spots and they were amazing, and off the beaten path. For us the area around Quinta Lili was the best of Puerto, the beach 100 yards away is perfect, the restaurants close by were the best we experienced. If you have security concerns.. don't. Quinta Lili is in a great neighborhood and  and a pleasure to walk around sunset for the views and late night walking home after some margaritas. Looking online at Puerto it is hard to choose"
50,"The Lili folks planned for us a world class wedding weekend. Our correspondence had been through email and a few Skype calls, so it was hard to know how it was all going to come together.  It turned out to be so much better than we could have ever envisioned.  The vendors they employed including the florist, makeup artist, cake, dance instructor, deejay and especially the boleros, were talented & professional.  The Villa proved to be a perfect venue for our Friday night welcome party and the ceviche and tinga feast was a hit with the guests.  The Lili folks were such gracious hosts we never had to worry about how are guests were getting along in Puerto. This included a few in my family who were terrified of visiting Mexico – (they are already planning their return trip!)  Adel"
50,"We were lucky to have stayed at Quinta Lili in the context of one of my colleagues' small wedding celebration. The owners and the support staff of this beautiful inn really know how to be outstanding as hosts, as well as managers of small events such as the small wedding we were attending. Adelina and Luis, our hosts, were simply amazing at the level of detailed attention and support they provided us. In as far as accommodations, there can hardly be anything better. They make one feel truly at home. From the food they served us, to the attention to details, and the expert advice they provided us; they were just right on target. I would highly recommend Quinta Lili for anyone planning to spend time in Puerto Escondido, and particularly for anyone seeking the perfect place for a"
50,I dont normally write reviews but this place is definaltey worth of an amazing one!  My boyfriend and I arrived here not really having any expectations.  We were blown away by the hospitality and how helpful Ade and her staff were.  We stayed up in the master suite which has everything you need including an awesome Jacuzzi.  We had some of the most delicious Mexican food there (some of the best we had in Mexico) It is also only a short walk to the most beautiful bay and best place for swimming in Puerto. Ade (the owner) talked us through the map and made recommendations for activities and restaurants which were all amazing.  She also went out of her way to take my boyfriend to a chiropractor as he had injured his had.  Just a lovely lady who really made our stay in Puerto. This

Every recomendation from the owners on activities to try out, were spot on, Sport fishing, lagoon trip etc. The location of the hotel is awesome, We would not hesitate in recommending this place to our friends, we loved our time here"
50,"We stayed at Quinta Lilli for eight nights at the end of August at the end of our honeymoon.  From arrival (an unexpected pick up at the airport), our stay was an absolute delight.  Because of an early flight, our room wasn't ready for us when we arrived, but we were given lunch at Villa Lilli, towels and drinks to laze by the pool with.  Co-owner Adelena then drove us to Quinta Lilli (minutes round the corner) and showed us our room.  Because it was our honeymoon, we were given the master suite at the top of the house, which has a 4-person rooftop hot-tub, large open plan bedroom and mezzanine chill out area.  It was stunning, but what made it really special was that Adelena had decorated the room and bed with rose petals and flowers; her excitement and determination to make"

Awesome pool for relaxing at any time, spacious and clean room for more relaxing times, warm hospitality of the Villa Lili team , great chatting and socalising with Adelina, Claire, Luis, Irene and Luisa, unbeatable breakfast & service (One of us had stomach problems. Adelina and Claire organised and took him to the doctor’s appointments)  Dear Villa Lili team, thank you for hosting us so kindly. Thank you for organising a birthday party including cake. We keep the best memories only.  To sum up, 12 out of 10 points.  Highly recommended to anyone."
50,"This has been one of the lovliest places I have ever stayed on my travels. The hotel is gorgeous with a beautiful pool on site. It's walking distance from one of the quieter beaches and its not on the touristy strip so its peaceful. But the best thing about this place is the family who run it - Adalena, Luiz and Clare (and their adorable 3 year old daughter Louisa) - who really go out of their way for their guests. After a week here they really make you feel like its your home. Can't wait to return..."
50,"I spent 5 nights at Villa Lili during October 2012 and had an absolutely lovely time. I stayed at the Nemo room which is beautifully appointed to with a gorgeous view of the Pacific. What made the stay extra special is the hospitality of Adelina - one of the owners of the hotel and her staff. Moments after I stepped into my room, Adelina came over to personally ensure everything was okay and then gave me some excellent tips on things to do while in Puerto Escondido. She also helped make all reservations for a lagoon and dolphin-watching tours as well as my taxi trip from the airport to the hotel. One of the things I enjoyed the most is the delicious breakfast prepared by the professional and nice Villa Lili staff.  They serve local Oaxaca-style food which I enjoyed very much. I"
50,"This place is runnig by a family very nice people and very professional guys. You can be close to carrizalillo beach, nice option to snorkel, surf, swim and enjoy the nature. You can acess the street with restaurants and a small comercial center by walking 2 blocks. You can go to Zicatela beach by taxi with 2 Us$ dollars.The place has a nice swimming pool, with a bar and a chill loung (television, music, beer...). It's a place to relly enjoy and relax, because you are close to everything but in a no anoying place. Its silent, beautiful (specially at night when they turn on all the colorful LED lights around the hotel. Enjoy it they have a really nice breackfast and they give free rides to the beach."
50,"I had such an amazing time in Puerto Escondido and my stay at Villa Lilli was perfect. I stayed 13 days. The weather was perfect. A little hot during the day but we had a nice breeze this time of year. Our room was on the 4th floor with a beautiful view and breeze. The birds making there sweet sound every morning as our eyes open and our hearts fill with excitement for another day of amazing surf! We were well taking care of and the accommodation were beautiful. So relaxing the atmosphere.... And the inn keeper so very kind and willing to share the vibrant culture of the area. I'm so very blessed I found this place in such short notice and they could accommodate us. The prices are very reasonable and break fast is included. Fresh fruit and yogurt, cereal, fresh juice and coffee"
50,"This place is heaven, loved every minute! Breakfast is amazing, the place is amazing and the people are amazing!! Adelina and Luis were so friendly and accommodating. I've never relaxed so much, if you need to just chill out this is the place to go. If you want to go to the bars and beach its close as well. I will definately be back here one day soon! x"
50,"We were highly impressed by the fast, accurate and courteous replies from Luis when we used the online form on their website to book a room for the next day. Booking our stay was surprisingly simple. Our welcome experience the next day was nothing I had ever seen before: we were immediately kindly shown to our room as if we were family. This is a place where you can feel at home in a real paradise.  Adelina and other staff went the extra distance to help us find activities, negotiate a board rental or drive us to the bus station upon our departure. Every morning of our stay, Irene served us the MOST delicious Mexican breakfast, EVER! They really made sure we would enjoy every minute of our stay. Everything was very clean. Beautiful building.

There are many activities to do and it is awesome either you go with your friends or just you and your soulmate.. I would return for sure!!! "
50,Casamar was so beautiful. You were able to see and hear the beach from were our room was. The pool was beautiful and clean because the sun came right down on the pool. The workers were incredibly helpful and were able to inform us on many tourist attractions. This trip was my first time coming to Puerto Escondido at the hotel Casamar and I really hope to return very soon to Casamar because it was a very incredible experience for me an my family.
40,"The place is really nice, apartments are very charming mexican style with all necessary utilities, the gardens and hammocks are the place to have a few minutes for your own. The only ""bad"" thing is the pool has too much chlorine and it damaged our hair and bathing outfits."
10,"Very disappointing . Bad location, no services. Pictures are misleading. Junk left in parking area. Not what was expected at all. Looked quite up market on the net - unfortunately it is not. Very difficult to find also"
30,"The place is really nice, but service is not in line with expectations. Also, their rules are unpleasantly strict: all those can't do this, can't do that put us in a really bad mood after a while. You cannot even smoke in the garden!!! It's a pity since the hotel and the garden are really cozy and relaxing."
50,"A month at Casamar Suites just whizzed by - and oh, we wished we could have stayed longer!   Stepping off the dusty Mexican roads, just metres from the Zicatela Beach, Casamar is an absolute haven.  Lovely pool, comfortable loungers with shade offered by umbrellas or palapas.  Free yoga classes for residents with a variety of excellent teachers - along with zumba classes - fantastic to ease the guilt of eating and drinking so well in Mexico!   Casamar is in a good location - a 15-20minute walk along the beach to the main Zicatela strip of restaurants and shops.  A 5 minute walk to La Punta where there is a good choice of restaurants and cafes (CafeOle has excellent coffee and fresh juices).  Very easy to catch a taxi to the big SuperChe supermarket or into town (35pesos). "
50,"The place is gracious, the grounds are well kept, the ladies do a great job of keeping everything immaculate, and careful, Aranis has the brown eyes to make you blue! Also, Javier, who works there can guide you to outback places, we called it machete tours! We really enjoyed it."
50,"I have used this hotel for a large team of folks of 16 people and stayed here for a 3 + sabbatical with my wife and daughter. very accommodating hotel, beautiful and very individual rooms. the staff are top notch and very helpful and caring. its now a smoke free hotel too, so that's a plus to the non smokers. its a one block walk away from the famous beach of Zicetella pipeline. they have a weekly meet and greet during sunset, you don't want to miss that, food and drink and great conversations."
50,"As a solo traveler on my first visit to Puerto Escondido, I had a lot of requirements for where I stayed, some of them potentially conflicting:  safe, but not isolated; friendly, but still offering privacy; some luxuries, but not like living in a bubble (after all, you visit Mexico to experience Mexico, right?); and reasonably priced, but with great services.  Casamar Suites hit the bullseye on all counts.  It's a truly lovely ""resort"" that's in the heart of a great part of Puerto called La Punta, just steps to a terrific beach where you can both surf and swim.  There are also some cool cafes and restaurants nearby with a nice bohemian vibe.  The Casamar management, led by owner Willits, is phenomenal -- always extremely friendly and helpful.  Same can be said for the other"

50,"from a funky concrete bungalow to the modern, classic  inn it is today.  The owners are the friendliest couple who run it like it's their own home which it is when they are there. The rooms all have kitchens, modern bathrooms and comfortable beds designed and furnished in classic Mexican style. The pool is beautiful with shady seating areas.  The ocean is one house away at the end of a typical Mexican dusty road.  There you'll find a wide beach with white sand and the best surfing waves in the area.  Surfers from all over the world come there to ride the waves. The kitchen serves breakfast & lunch and will even cook a dinner for special order. We had a dinner party for 10 while we were there and great fun was had by all. As you can see we are big fans of Casamar!"
50,"My wife and I just spent 6 nights at this lovely little hotel very close to the Zicatella beach but in a quiet side street. Small, intimate, calm and secret - everything we were looking for. Clean rooms, fresh towels and bed linen. Spotlessly clean. Staff are friendly. The Swiss couple who own and run the hotel (they live on the premises) are always available and very efficient. Thanks to Manuela + Rene for a great week"
20,"We reserved there through booking.com after a friend recommended it and after reading reviews here. First of all, once taxes included and the rate exchange it ended up costing 175$ for two nights in a family room. We don't mind paying but we expect, at that price quality and a helpful owner. At that price we usually get at least a free coffee in the morning!  The interior court is lovely and well maintained. The pool water could be a bit better and there definitely are not enough long chairs. Two couples actually hogged four of the five chairs during our entire stay. Leaving their stuff on the chairs while going out to shop. Owners should have seen to that. Now the room: four twin beds as we were told. But the two up ladder , because it was a ladder to go up, had mattresses that"
50,I can't say enough great things about this place. The only downside was that we only stayed 3 nights. I wish we had stayed longer! We were greeted by Manuela who was super friendly and gave us so many great recommendations about puerto escondido. The grounds and the rooms were so much better than we were even expecting! We were in one of the larger rooms that even had a loft area with 3 additional beds! The grounds were kept beautiful with all sorts of star fruit trees and other plant life surrounding the pool. We especially liked the honor bar that was provided (and we made good use of it).  We would recommend hotelito Swiss oasis to anyone! We hope to return soon! 
50,We stayed here for 5 nights in January and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hosts were very helpful and accommodating and you can see they run a pretty slick show. The location is perfect just off the main drag and walking distance to beautiful ocean scenery. We got several tasty food tips which meant we never went hungry. We payed more because the booking.com does not include taxes so my advice would be to email the hotel directly for available accomodation. They were very prompt to reply when we emailed them regarding an extra night. The cats can be sneaky so watch out for them and don't leave your door open. Overall a great stay if you want a very calm atmosphere. Pool was nice also! 
50,"My friend and I stayed for 8 nights over New Years Eve. Hotelio Swiss Oasis and Manuela was the perfect place for us to stay! I didn't want to leave! Overall it was a great experience. The hotel is just a short walk to Playa Zicatela (about 2 minutes), and close to everything... restaurants, shops, OXXO, taxis, other beaches and nightlife. Though the nightlife starts at midnight, on the nights we stayed in, we barely heard the noise from the parties. But when we did go out, it was lovely to know that home was really close, like literally across the street so the hotel is very convenient.   The room was clean, no a/c, but we didn't need it. The evenings were cool. We didn't experience mosquitos until towards the end of our stay, but there really weren't many mosquitos at all."
40,"Hotelito is a gorgeous 8 room hotel that boasts a nice pool and a homey feel. Rooms are very nice and eclectic but watch out for the mosquitoes. Owners are nice and they offer fishing and surfing with local guys. Fishing was unreal but watch the price, it varied for all of the guests who went around the same time as us (haggle). Surfing was so great as well and the instructor was so nice! The pricing at the hotel was a little strange; we wanted to keep the room for an extra day just to be able to shower before heading out on a long bus. The price was 150 pesos but then changed to 300 after we paid for fishing.... Otherwise stay was lovely and comfortable!"
50,"Stayed for 3 weeks and couldnt have been happier. Right near the amazing surf beach and great restaurants. The staff were amazing and very helpful with information. Rooms where nice and spacious with everything we needed.comfortable beds and super clean, cleaned everyday without fail. Swimming pool was lovely when the surf was too big to swim in."
50,"Great place just off the main Zicatela boulevard. A very relaxed oasis just a couple of steps from Zicatela beach and all bars and restaurants. Great pool, clean room, nice courtyard to chill and a very warm and helpful owner Manuela."
50,"Manuela and Rene are very welcoming and will give you good hints about what to do in and around Puerto Escondido. The rooms are very spacious and clean with lots of wooden elements which give them a real charm. No AC, but fan and ventilator. A small balcony with view on a garden. The pool invites you jumping into it and is surrounded by palm-trees. The hotel is located a bit off the Main Street of Playa Zicatella. So no sea view, but also no noise from surrounding bars and nightclubs! The location is calm. Otherwise it is a short taxi-ride from the center of Puerto Escondido (or a 20mins walk on the beach). No breakfast, but very good options just around the corner. Definitely a place to consider if you are in the area! "
50,"A friend had set me up in a different hotel that seemed more intent on construction and party than comfort.  I immediately consulted TA.  Every review about Hotelito is spot on...  I was greeted by Manuela on check in and shown a quaint room in a corner.  There is no AC or TV which is fine by me.  The breeze through the room is enough.  They have a kitchen if you want to fix your own meals.  There is an Honor Bar with beer and water.  They occasionally set up tours.  (I am kicking myself for missing out on the trip to the sea turtle breeding beach.)  It is clean, quiet, eclectic, I enjoyed my stay"
50,"I stayed there with wife and 6 kids.  Sergio rented us the Villa. It's a 4 room beautifully decorated Villa with it's own Palapa, full functioning kitchen. I would HIGHLY recommend the Villa to anyone tavelling with a large group. My 8 year old kid observation:  This Place is ""la ley""... Very cool"
50,"A beautiful hotel.  Clean, well presented and full of interesting design features.  It was very quiet when we visited so we had the pool to ourselves.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and spoke English (which was helpful for us).  Lovely breakfast, clean and relaxing rooms.  We stayed in a suite and it was wonderful - thank you!"
50,"We stayed for two weeks at this lovely hotel and did not want to leave.  Yes, all the reviews are true.  If you are looking for a clean, comfortable, secure hotel in a good location, this is it.  We had a suite with a private balcony, air cond., great ocean view and access to the kitchenette, it was perfect.  Sergio was very helpful, answered any questions we had and manages the hotel skillfully.  The hotel is very clean, well looked after and the staff always friendly and helpful.  The on-site restaurant served us one of our best meals while in puerto. Try the ratatouille.. excellent.  The location was perfect for us.  An easy walk to all the beaches, the market etc.. all within 10 to 20 min.  The hotel offers an inviting pool to cool off in... very nice indeed.  The hotel"
40,New Years Eve is always a difficult time to find accommodation especially when you are travelling with seven people and no-one can speak the local language fluently. The manager of this Hotel went out of his way in the most difficult time of the year to help us return to Mexico city via various means of transport which we could get no satisfaction out of the local travel agents. The place was kept very clean and all the staff went out of their way to ensure you enjoyed your stay. We were on a long extended vacation but this was a highlight staying here for 5 nights over the busiest period of the year.
40,"We spent a week at Hotel Paraiso and found it to be a wonderful place to spend some down time .  The rooms were clean, large (we had a suite), and good value.  Breakfast wasn't included but the hotel had a little kitchenette with a fridge so we could prepare our breakfasts.  The pool was wonderful... great to come back from the beach and read a  book by the pool and we enjoyed a few too many drinks sitting there!  Sergio the manager, is great.. and really helpful.    The hotel is not by the main surf beach but its no problem as the taxis are 20 pesos to the beach and they all have roof racks for surf boards! While we were in PE, we surfed with Oasis Surf school in the morning and also had Spanish lessons at Oasis Spanish school in the afternoon.   While your in PE, make sure you"
50,"We stayed in Hotel Paraiso Escondido last August, at what was probably the hottest time of the year.  The hotel was a real oasis, it has a fantastic swimming pool which we could use until late and our suite had a small dipping pool that was a real bonus.  The room was comfortable and was always kept spotlessly clean; it was very cool thanks to a very large window that we liked having open all the time as it also gave us a fantastic panorama: we enjoyed watching the lightning from the comfort of our room when the storms finally arrived.  The large terrace had amazing views over to the mountains or to the Bahia Principal, Zicatela and beyond;   The garden is very well tended, it has lots of flowers which occasionally attracted hummingbirds and scattered all over there are stone"
50,"Hotel Paraiso is distinguished by its detail.  On each floor of this hotel, which creeps up the hill away from the shore, the visitor can discover details to enjoy.  There are mermaids, warriors, monkeys, iguanas, and painted birds. In addition, there are views, fine breakfasts (Tuesday-Sunday), friendly management, and spotless, simply furnished rooms.  We highly recommend this hotel.  And we are discriminating.  Patricia Housen & Genaro Molina. Ciao Sergio!"
50,"This hotel has great deals on its rooms until November - check out the website for prices, 50 USD for a room with 2 double beds which is a real bargain. The rooms are very comfortable and clean with quaint maritime furnishings, air conditioning, private bathroom and balconies.  The location is good, central to shops and restaurants on El Adoquin, and midway between the surfer beach Zicatela, and quieter coves Angelito and Manzanillo. From the balconies you also have a view of the surrounding coast.  The hotel has a lush swimming pool great for relaxing after a long day at the beach. The manager Sergio is multilingual, and very helpful, offering local advice, booking us a taxi for our onward trip and generally being very nice.  Highly recommended!"
50,"We have enjoyed our stay very much. The friendly owner has patinetly answered all our questions, the staff was very nice, the room was spotless clean and quiet and the pool open until 10.00pm. If we ever go back to Puerto Escondido, we definitely try to get Suite No. 2 again...  Thanks for everything."
50,"This beatutiful hotel, with a lot of artistic details to discover during your stay, is situated two minutes from the main street and the main beach, right by the bus-station and the  supermarket. You can reach Zicatela by a 15 min walk, or 3 min by taxi, at the cost of 3 usd. It is situated a bit above sealevel, so there is a good view fram the rooms, that all have balconies. To come ""home"" to the hotel is like coming to an oasis of peace and calmness and birds singing. Getting hot,  just dip in the swimmingpool. Our teenagers realy enjoyed it here too, they became totally relaxed, used the pool a lot, and could seek out some more exitement just around the corner when needed. Everyone of the staff we met at our stay of 5 days were smiling and helpful, and also descrete and"
40,"We stayed 3 nights and had wonderful meals and drinks. The staff had very good English and were courteous. Areas to improve ...  internet strength, more pool loungers, and paved parking. The owner of our condo needs to provide guests with more info and directions about amenities, such as TV, wifi, and appliances. Vivo is way off the beaten path, which we liked, but was an issue for some of our friends."
50,My family and I stayed at Vivo from 11/12/2017 through 11/19/2017. I had the time of my life. The staff and everyone that work there were so helpful and accomodating to all my family. Very special place to visit.  
50,"Just returned from a week at vivo..rented a car at the airport which worked out quite well compared to using a taxi or shuttle..the car provided us freedom to come and go and explore different venues..drove right to the resort with no problems..sure vivo is 30 minutes from the airport, and that is exactly why we picked it. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Rodrigo,  who showed us our room and general info about  the resort..our room had a view of the beach, a nice patio and all the comforts  that one would expect in a condo. We didn't  have much contact  with the staff but all were very pleasant and friendly.  I didn't  find the pools overcrowded  and had the pool to myself a couple of times..the pools are not heated but  after a couple cocktails..who cares.. They are getting"
50,"Puerto Escondido is a wonderful small city in Mexico.  Although I love visiting the town. Vivo Resorts is a bit outside the town and allows you to relax and have a great beach experience when you want to escape the city.  I loved both experiences, the resort and the town.  Very under publicized and I LOVE that."
50,"I wasn't sure what to expect with it being a bit out from Puerto Escondido on a dirt road; but the hotel is awesome, the best I've stayed near Puerto Escondido.  It had spacious luxurious rooms, excellent balconies overlooking the ocean, swimming pool, friendly staff."
10,"The hotel is extremely far from downtown and the airtport. An airport ride would cost 500 pesos and there´s no way you can go downtown at night. (it´s about 30 min ride to downtown in a super dark road and a dirt road). The service provided by Alma was amazing, but everything in the hotel seemed slow and improvised.  The sea is perpetually on the red flag, and the pool is completely packed. Also they blame their lack of preparation to serve guests on the construction, but it still seems to be short of service."
20,"We came here for our annual Thanksgiving getaway.   The property is very remote and the driveway to the resort is a dirt road. You can only go very slow.  Upon arriving we were greeted by a friendly person under palapa. There is no lobby. There is a 20ft container serving as a “store”. The entire thing is under construction.   First we were shown the Ocean front penthouse facing east, it was the fourth after the direct ocean front I believe, but we could see the ocean. There was constant construction noise from the villas build next to the resort. Hammering, buzz saws and a bulldozer moving sand obnoxiously beeping. We were already annoyed after 30 mins here.  Our friend had a cheaper studio right by the clubhouse construction. It was even worse.  We checked out the pool. All"
50,"When we pulled out of the airport and started heading to the resort, we thought where are we going.  Even though it's isolated it's a lovely quiet resort with a great restaurant, we had a penthouse apartment, the resort has 2 pools and is right on the beach, it's has a little shop for most things you need and a shuttle bus to get you into town or anywhere. Restaurant food was great.  Would just be nice if there were a few other restaurants around for a bit of variation."
50,"We had an amazing vacation at Vivo. Trips into Puerto Escondido combined with lazy days at the resort was the ideal mix. Can't say enough about the location, service and staff. Trying to figure out how we can get back again!"
40,"We really like Vivo, ideal for a quiet couples vacation or family fun.  It is isolated, which we like, but maybe if you are looking to be close to the night life you might want something in town.  The rooms are extremely clean, great views.  We love the chef Roberto, he makes the one restaurant a pleasure to dine at.  The place is still under construction, it will be that much more amazing when they finish the club house.  "
50,"My wife and I celebrated our 25th Anniversary here in July 2012 and had the most wonderful experience.  It is hard to exaggerate the superlatives that come with this place: clean and aesthetically pleasing rooms and immaculate grounds; outrageously gorgeous balcony views; a wonderful beach for swimming, snorkeling, surfing, sunning and drinking; a great on site restaurant called the Espadin with stunning views and a welcoming and attentive staff.  We were so impressed by the night manager Mayra and the day manager Gabriella.  They were gracious, engaging and accommodating – made us feel so welcome.  This is a gem of a refuge.  Highly recommend it to anyone with a romantic reason to celebrate and splurge! A couple things we would change if we could would be the road to the place"
50,"Enjoyed a wonderful couple of weeks in one of their villas perched on top of the cliffs overlooking the secluded bay and beach just outside of the town. The location is amazing, it is a quick walk down steps to the beach, there is a good restaurant on site and the accommodations are very comfortable. Be aware that all of the villas are different so make sure you pick one that suits your needs, we stayed in Florencia which was perfect for our family of four with a view over the ocean, two bedrooms, a small kitchenette and outside dining area. Fabulous."
50,"As soon as we arrived we knew we had made the right decision to stay here. The one bedroom villas we stayed in (we stayed in two) had uninterrupted views of the bay and evening sunsets.  The rooms were amazing - there website shows detailed pictures of the rooms so you know what you are getting before you book. A great idea!! Reception and bar staff were fantastic and friendly. The bar has undoubtedly the best cocktails in Puerto and the food is great. Even if you don't stay here you should eat here at least once to enjoy that view. Even though you are slightly out of town, reception are more than happy to arrange a taxi for you and taxis are cheap! (20 - 40 peso) I can not speak highly enough of this place and thoroughly recommend it to anyone!"
50,"Can't image there's a better place in Escondido.  Food was great, pool was relaxing, and the views just can't be beat. To get into town it's just a quick cab ride, it's also walkable, but there's little shade along the road.  Rooms were unique, although I had a few scorpions to battle, but they were here first so what can ya do? Staff was completely understanding and took care of the situation very well.  Stay here, you won't be disappointed."
50,"Villas Carrizalillo is a beautiful place to stay if you are traveling with your significant other or your family. A very quiet place, the staff is very, very friendly and always willing to help. The rooms are very clean and A/C is a blessing, most of them have kitchens and living rooms, and look for rooms with balcony to get an awesome view (Mitla, Colorada rooms, for example. To access the beach you must go down a set of about 30 stairs. It can be a challenge, but once you realize that Carrizalillo is the best beach in Puerto Esconido to relax, you'll know that is worth it. Surf lessons can be taken, but the waves are very small. Zicatela surf beach and other popular spots are 10 minutes away from Villas Carrizalillo."
50,"Amy Hardy, her husband and their staff have created a wonderfully relaxing haven of a dozen or so unique and beautifully decorated villas overlooking the friendly carrizolillo public beach.   We enjoyed a week of spending the day at the beach or at the small hotel pool, and eating at the hotel's restaurant which - in our opinion - was the best place to eat in pto. escondido. We have been traveling for over 2 years now, and have stayed in a lot of places, and Villas Carrizolillo is in our top 3.  Thanks again Amy for a wonderful week."
40,Very very relaxing stay. The location is stunning and the restaurant very good. Not a huge amount to do but if you are looking to relax this place is perfect. 
50,"I spotted Villas years ago from Carrizalillo beach while vacationing with some college friends and always thought it would be a fantastic place to stay. The hotel overlooks one of my favorite beaches in Mexico, with waves but calm enough for more tentative swimmers. It's just a short walk down some stairs to the beach from the hotel.   Our family stayed in the Venecia villa, which is near the entrance to the hotel and doesn't have an ocean view, but was fabulous all the same. There are plenty of common areas (an upper terrace with a bar, a lower sundeck, a little lounge with hammocks and couches) with great views where one can enjoy the sunset or just sit and read. The rooms were nicely furnished with pretty local artwork and tiles and very comfortable. The only big complaint I"
50,"Beautiful views from panoramic windows of room Escondido. Short walk down steps to isolated, intimate beach, good for swimming (no impediments). Roof top, open air, thatched dining room; beautiful food and well served. A dream hotel and location, Specially Recommended."
50,"Five star service, rooms, views, and food. What else is there to say? We arrived late on a Sunday after a seven-hour drive from Oaxaca, had a late lunch and did not eat anywhere else. The food slayed us and we became hopelessly addicted to the anticipation of the next meal. In three days we managed to eat our way through most of the menu, but saved one or two items for our next visit. This is a very special place, so special it deserves its own blog post.  Michael Latin Journeys"
50,"I had a terrific time at Quinta Lili. It's a beautiful, boutique hotel situated near some great restaurants and stunning beaches. Very relaxed, modern, clean. The breakfasts each morning were amazing. A terrific way to start every morning!   I would never hesitate to recommend to my friends to visit Quinta Lili in Puerto Escondido. Amazing!"
50,"I cancelled another hotel reservation when I came across this hotel on TripAdvisor, and I am glad I did. We stayed at Quinta Lili and had a great time, it's clean, great service, nice breakfast, nice swimming pool, located 200 meters from one of the prettiest beaches in Puerto Escondido. I wish we could have stayed longer!"
50,"Stayed here while on a solo surf trip in Mexico.  The owners were very helpful in arranging excursions and offering advice regarding local restaurants and attractions.  They even included me in some of the excursions that they were taking whilst there, something they really did not have to do but for which I was very great full and really enjoyed.  The breakfasts were incredible. I stayed for 8 days and had a different local dish prepared for me every morning in addition to quality fresh fruit selection that was put out with every breakfast.   Overall great staff , beautiful house & rooms, close to a couple of good restaurants and shops , 5 minute walk to the beach. Hoping to come back with a group of friends in the near future.  For those surfing ,the house is a 5 minute walk"
50,"We stayed at Quinta Lili for four days at the end of May for a belated honeymoon, and we had an incredible time. Before we even arrived, we found Luis and Claire very accommodating. Luis purchased our tickets for our Mexican travel because we were having trouble with our US credit card. After we arrived to PE, Claire met us at the hotel, offered us a delicious drink, and sat down with us to hand draw on a map the best places in PE. She was incredibly helpful and her recommendations were the absolute best from restaurants to beaches to activities. She also coordinated everything for us, including a boat tour of the lagoon (really fun, and I am not a bird person), releasing sea turtles, and massages. She was present and available but also gave us plenty of space. We stayed in the"
50,"Our stay at Quinta Lili was one of the best I've ever experienced.  From a lovingly prepared breakfast, awesome room, terrific pool, proximity to the beach...and friendly, helpful owners, it only has one drawback...I didn't want to leave.  The location is quiet yet close enough to restaurants and provisions that you could survive nicely without a car.  Taxis are however plentiful and very inexpensive if you wish to go into town or down to some of the other beaches. Puerto Escondido was also great as you're with the locals and everything was available...entertainment and dancing, great restaurants, outdoor activities, and above all,   DOING NOTHING!!!  We will most definitely return.  We also stayed at Casa Lili and all of the above applies to that property as well.  It would be"
50,"We stayed here on our trip to PE. this April and it was perfect. They arranged a cab to take us to and from Huatulco which was really nice. Quinta Lili is lovely, well kept and everyone who works there goes above and beyond.   Because of the set up, you feel completey at home (they have a bar set up that runs on an honour system). We've already recommended this place to our friends and family and would for sure stay here again.   It's a cheap cab or collective ride to get down to the Zicatela. Make sure not to miss breakfast. Magdelana is an amazing cook."
50,"The Quinta Lili website says that it is loving and idyllic, and we can affirm that it definitely is! Our family spent 10 wonderful days in Puerto Escondido staying at Quinta Lili. We are traveling with our 8 month old son, so wanted to find places where we could take it easy comfortably when back for nap time and when he went to bed. Quinta Lili was great! Our host, Claire, was always very friendly and helpful. We were amazed at how much time she spent helping guests get around. She even offered to babysit so we could go on an evening outing to experience the bio-luminescence in a nearby lagoon! And took us to the airport for an early flight. The main staff person, Magdalena, was also super friendly and did a wonderful job with breakfast and tidying our room.  The only thing"
50,"Second stay at Quinta Lilli and gotta say it only keeps getting better! Adelina and Claire really know how to take care of their guests and really ensure that all are happy! Stayed in the Master suite and the room and views are really amazing! Also, great location to the beach and the rinconada!  Surfing was amazing at Playa Carrazillillo this trip! Normally need to take a ride to Playa Punta....not this trip! Food around town was amazing, as always. The best food though is at Quinta.....best breakfast in town!  I will definitely be back to Quinta! Really amazing!!"
50,"Other positive reviews are absolutely accurate when they indicate Quinta Lili is a special place -- it always hits a ""sweet spot"" for us.  The atmosphere is relaxing and personal, the size just right, the rooms ample and nicely maintained, the breakfasts fresh and tasty. And the best beach in the area is just a short walk away. Whenever we go to Puerto Escondido, Quinta Lili is definitely our preferred place to stay. As others have mentioned, Adelina and her staff make everyone feel special with their personal gracious attention. It is a real gem!"
50,"Everything was AMAZING. I was really impressed and pleased by stylish and clean room with beautiful view from balcony, convenient location, nice ambiance, delicious breakfast, friendly service and warm hospitality. Should I come to Puerto Escondido again, definitely I would go to Quinta Lili Enquiry ONLY."
50,"Villa Lili was absolutely ah-maaaaaaazing! The building was stunning to look at, comfortable to sleep in, the traditional Mexican breakfasts were to-die-for every morning! Luis and his family were staying when we were there and they were more than accomodating, not only personally driving one of our friends to the doctor when she was sick, driving us to the bus stop for our departure, but also buying us birthday cakes for (coincidently) 2 birthdays we spent in the 4 days we were there. The rooms all have views of the beach, and Villi Lili is located within a 5 minute walk to your own beach, Playa Carazillo, which is beautiful and not overrun by tourists. The strip of restaurants also has fantastic fresh seafood. I can't wait to go back to Puerto Escondido and I will be staying"
50,"We highly recommend Villa Lili. Upon arrival in PE we did not have a place and so we searched and found it through tripadvisor. We contacted Luis and right away he sent us a response. Upon arrival at Villa Lili we were welcomed and arrangements were made for us to stay. The place is awesome, incredibly clean, modern, and it gives you the peace you are looking for in a vacation. Quiet, great pool, great views. Now let us tell you about the breakfast -served from 8 until noon so you can sleep in and still make it for breakfast - it is to die for. Authentic Mexican with all the stuff you want, fresh juice, fruits, cereal, coffee (very good) and just ask what you would like and they make it.  We ended up staying for 10 days and loved it. Claire and her daughter and Luis happened to"
50,"We read all the reviews here before booking our stay and Luis, Claire and their wonderful team surpassed all our expectations.  From the moment of booking Luis was brilliant advising us on travel and booking the local flight from Oaxaca to Puerto on our behalf.  Then from the moment we arrived we felt like we were one of the family rather than a paying client.  Breakfast was a highlight every day with beautiful fresh fruit and a different hot course each cooked by Irena - in fact Irena's meals are up there with our favourite from our time in Mexico.  The rooms were spotlessly clean and remained cool  due to Luis' clever design - despite the fact that there was no air-conditioning.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our time at Villa Lili with easy access to the local beautiful beaches,"
50,We stayed here for a couple of lazy days by the beach and it was just beautiful! A short walk from playa carrizalillo (the good swimming beach) and restaurants and some of the best cafes Ive eaten at so far along Benito Juarez. We woke up to stunning views of the pacific every morning with a delicious fresh and hot breakfast waiting for us by the pool. Hosts were lovely and forever helpful and even dropped us at the bus station at the end of our stay. I can't reccomend this place enough!
50,"My husband and I spent in this wonderful place for 3 days/2 night and we will never forget such perfect designed unique place for rest. We arrived in early morning, at 5 a.m. and Adelina (our Host) met us, and it was pleaser surprise for us and we felt ourselves like really-welcome-guest. It was in the beginning. Then, when we wake up, the breakfast was waiting us: fresh fruits, fresh juice, and delicious food, which was prepared by very pleasant woman :) What about rooms and territory? Every apartment has its own charm. I want to say that it is very smart, green and clean territory with comfortable pool, calm music, chillout place, and testy drinks in the bar ;) The women who cleaned the room and prepared breakfast are very polite, I would even say that they were like a family"
50,"Villa Lilli is a gorgeous B&B with all you could ask for. With its incredibly helpful and friendly hosts who put on one delicious and plentiful breakfast, its beautiful and clean rooms, sea views and a great location within close proximity to the beach and many lovely restaurants ranging from the local Mexican dishes to the likes of Italian - Villa Lilli is the perfect stay."
50,"A b&b is what this place is. Amazing authentic homemade Mexican breakfast made to order. Quiet. Close to the beach and restaurants. They screwed up our first nights reservation and we had to book elsewhere, very frustrating. They then offered us the week for free and a major room upgrade, wow!! ... What a pleasant experience! Will come back. 10/10"

50,"Just got back 6 days ago from Puerto Escondido and stayed at both Villa Lili and Qunita Lili on my recent visit. Both are amazing places and loved the location, rooms, facilities and most importantly the staff - they are so friendly and accomodating. Was a wonderful time!  Stayed in the Exotica Suite at Qunita lil which has amazing views of the Pacific! So nice to sit outside in the evening watching the sunset reading my book. Enjoyed the hot tub for 4 which is in a private location and very romantic! The room is very spacious and while I was busy with so many activities - always loved coming back to my room and hanging!  The facilities are great - beautiful. long, large pool to relax in after a day out. Wonderful bar/sitting area that provides a great meeting place to converse"
50,"In March and April 2012 I stayed 6 weeks again in the lovely premises of Villa Lili/ Puerto Escondido. And the comfy and cosy feeling that this warm-heartet paradise oasis delivers remains prevailing even after. Adelina, Luis and the affectionate staff every time make me feel at home - at the same time offering great support, service and help wherever needed. The entire facilities are perfectly maintained every day, all rooms are cosily furbished in different themes and as always the every day freshly cooked breakfast is a hit!   In the upper part of Puerto, Villa Lili is perectly located close by the famous beach Carrizalillo but also at short distance to beautiful beaches like Puerto Angel and Manzanillo. The City centre is i walking distance and since in Puerto all ways are"
50,"Casamar Suites offered the best of dusty Mexican streets, a lively surfing community and first-class accommodations with an extremely helpful staff. Somehow, I managed to break a tooth ... the reception folks set me up with a top-flight dentist, summoned a cab, furnishing the driver with directions to the appropriate office and I had a successful, if not pain-free event. Oh, and it was half of the cost it would have been at home. Perhaps this is an odd vacation tip, but these things happen and that kind of guest care is an epitome of complete service. On Christmas Day, my daughter and I were the only ones on the sprawling beach five minutes from the apartment - Casamar is 15 individual, beautifully appointed units, each with its own kitchen - but on most days she surfed each"
50,Really friendly and helpful staff. Wife enjoyed the complimentary yoga and I enjoyed the surf! Lots of cheap taxis so it's easy to get around. Also lots of small mercados near by for your daily supplies. Would defiantly stay again. Thanks.
50,"We stayed in the Rosas suite, a comfortable and spacious place with cooking facilities.  The garden setting was very peaceful and the pool was wonderful.  We were one block from a beautiful and almost deserted beach; the hotel even provided beach chairs and umbrella for our enjoyment.  The sunsets were spectacular.  But most of all, the friendliness of the staff made our three days stay a great experience.  Thanks."
40,"We stayed here for a few days while in Puerto Escondido and it was a nice relaxing location.   A little noisy in the morning as it is in a residential subdivision and you could hear cars, workers, etc, if you are not a morning person.  The beds are typical Mexican hard, a little too hard for us, and the curtains need to be upgraded to blackout curtains.   When we are back in PE would feel very comfortable staying at casamar again and if the beds and curtains would be upgraded it would make the stay even more enjoyable.   The staff are great and everyone was very nice and helpful. "
50,"Casamar is a charming, walled, retreat from the noise and heat of Puerto Escondido.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff are always available to offer helpful suggestions for your travel needs.  The grounds are gorgeous, the pool is clean, large, and at perfect temperature.  The casitas are finished with Mexican tile and feature woven linens in the kitchen.  Note that Casamar is located about a 30 minute walk from the surf beaches and a little further from Puerto Escondido. Taxi's, or collectives are easily hailed. It's a 5 minute walk to groceries, and a variety of restaurants serving coastal foods.  Yoga and Zumba classes are offered free to guests.  Another unique treat is the maid who sang gentle, quiet, songs while she worked in the mornings!  We were there in October and it"
40,"this is a perfect hotel, in the outskirts of lovely puerto escondido. the rooms are specious and comfortable, around the fantastic tropical garden, and pool, a private parking, and a very good base for trips in the area. but the most of all, is the owner WILLITZ SAWYER, a friendly terrific guy, and his lady manager, who paid attention to every detail, and their very good guidance and advice, made our stay very very enjoyable. THANK YOU WILLITZ !"
50,"Everything was excellent. I stayed 3 weeks with my mother. We had spacious two bedroom apartment. Pool and the gardens are lovely. The hotel is 2 mins walk from the beach. Short walk to the surf spot La Punta. Other surf spot Playa Zicatela is also a walking distance away, but I always took a cheap taxi to get there and saved energy for surfing. The owner was awesome and really helpful. I am happy to recommend this place for anyone.   Free yoga and zumba several times a week. The yoga mats and other equipment were always available to use. We did a boat trip with Javier, who works at the hotel. The trip was awesome and included a lunch break and chilling on on a private, really beautiful beach."
50,"This is my 6th year returning to beautiful Casamar. Staff are friendly and helpful. Owners, top-notch.  I love the pool and the beautiful gardens.  The local residents who live around Casamar are friendly, just say hello and you will get a warm greeting and a smile back. Meet & Greet nights, always enjoyable.  I definitely recommend this boutique hotel."
50,Stayed here for 2 weeks with my grad class. It was amazing. Nice and close to the main road where you can easily catch a cab or collectivo. Close to beach and the rooms are beautiful and authentic. Grounds are very very well kept! Staff are friendly !!
50,"The casamar establishment is both well built and well maintained by a ultra friendly and well versed grounds crew.the rooms are spotless and well maintained  complete with kitchenette,AC  & poolside accommodations. They have a complimentary happy hour\meet & greet every evening which is awesome if you're curious how to entertain yourself in the area. All in all its hard to imagine a more economic place to stay with such bountiful amenities."
50,"I can say nothing furthermore that is already spelt in the other comments.  It is the best place on zicatela, If you want to visit or surf. The place is very good located. It's not directly on the main road, so you havent' the noise from the Bar and the street. Thank you Manuela & René for this good moments. I hope we se you soon !!!  Lionel"
40,"A great and personable hotel to stay at. The rooms are clean, the beds are better than most of the other places in PE. There is no air conditioning but the fan turned up and the sliding door open allowed to adequate air flow. The pillows were less than to be desired - very uncomfortable so bring your own. The owner of the hostel is great, very friendly and hospitable.  It can be a bit noisy if people decide to sit out late at night talking amongst themselves, as the sit right out the front of the bedrooms.  Private bathrooms with very good showers. It's a very safe and trustworthy hotel. "
50,"Hotelito Swiss Oasis is aptly named.  Such a great location, a beautiful property, so clean and incredibly well maintained.  Manuella is the perfect hostess, with helpful tips for everything.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place when you are staying in Escondido - you won't get a better deal anywhere...  Thanks for a wonderful stay Manuella."
50,"We came to Swiss Oasis after three nights roughing it in a hostel and it was such a relief. The room are spacious and clean with private bathrooms, the hotel has a beautiful pool area and the location is central to all of the restaurants and night life of Zicatela. Manuella is amazing and looked after us so well with all sorts of tips, from where to get a collectivo to the markets to what to order from which restaurants. She even lent me a camera cable that I left at our last destination and when I couldn't find a replacement, she sold me her one. Plus, they have beers and bottled water for 15 pesos - amazing! I'd recommend Swiss Oasis to anyone and will be back if I ever come to Puerto again."
50,"This place is a great pick if you choose to stay in Puerto Escondido. It's aptly named as Puerto Escondido can become very hot and humid in the summer and it's a party town too. It's an Oasis in the sense of it's location and due to the fact that is has a pool. The location is ideal as it's centrally located on Playa Zicatela but because it's little bit back from the beach it's nice and quiet. On hot and humid summer days the pool is an awesome respite, a facility that not all hotels in Puerto Escondido have. Most importantly your hosts Manuela and René are incredibly welcoming, hospitable and helpful. I only mentioned that a mosquito bit me over night, immediately our hosts found a mosquito net and hung it up over my bed. These guys know the area well and recommend places to"
50,"We spent 4 nights with Manuela, Rene and Luna( the dog)  plus the 5 cats and had the most warm reception from all of them. It's very centrally located on Playa Zicatela with lots of the beach clubs, bars and restaurants at your door step. The place itself is off the main road, so nice and quiet. The pool is a huge bonus on the hot days mid summer and a great place to interact with both guests who in our case were an international crowd that swapped ideas and stories on travel. The rooms are immaculately clean, have Internet access and hot water. We loved it here and even ended up extending our stay. I'd be back!"
50,"I love this place! We stayed here for three nights in July 2013.  Everything was as advertised: the wi-fi worked great (in rooms #1 and #8), the rooms and pool were super clean, and the community kitchen was well-equipped.  It's obvious that Manuela and René have poured much love and pride into their hotel. It's the small details that make this place shine: the bed mattresses were high quality, the beach towels were useful, and the honor-system poolside beer fridge was a nice treat.  I would definitely stay here again."
50,The Hotelito is a very nice place to stay. Manuela and René are very friendly and helful hosts who really care about their guests! The rooms are beatyfully arranged and clean and the atmosphere in the hotel is relaxed.
40,"i really enjoyed my 4-night stay at hotelito swiss oasis. manuela greeted us warmly on arrival and i immediately felt welcome and at ease. the facilities were useful and we were able to enjoy both the pool and communal kitchen. the room itself was plain but comfortable and included a private bathroom and porch. the room was cleaned daily, which was extremely considerate given the budget price. my only complaint would be that the fan in the room didn't help much with the heat and i had trouble sleeping while there. i also tend to be a magnet for mosquitoes and although a net was provided, it didn't quite fit the king size bed. (however, i'll take a king size bed over anything!) otherwise, i believe this is one of the absolute best places to stay in zicatela. it is in the center"
50,"Highly recommend staying here if you are planning to come to Puerto Escondito. Awesome location just off the main beach in Zicatela, close enough to be right in on the action but not have any problems with the noise from local bars of a night. The owners went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, very useful for pointing out the good places to eat, things to do & see etc. Pool area was exactly as pictured & always clean. The room was clean, hot water, wifi & a very large & comfortable bed. We really enjoyed our stay at Hotelio Swiss Oasis & would highly recommend it to anyone."
50,"I really like this hotel.  My wife and I have stayed here four times over the last decade or so and find no reason to choose any other place in PE.  The rooms and suites are all different in decoration and sometimes in layout and size…but there’s not a bad room/suite in the place. The hotel is not on the beach but is only a short walk from the Playa Principal. Most mornings we would walk to the Playa Principal, then to Playa Marinero and then continue to the end of Playa Zicatela. On the way back, we would have breakfast at one of the Zicatela restaurants. In the other direction, the attractive Playa Manzanilla is about a kilometer’s walk away. It’s a hot walk back later in the day but a taxi or a water taxi can bring you home for little cost (about $3-4 for a taxi anywhere in"
50,"If you are thinking of staying at Hotel Paraiso Escondido, go ahead and book.  My husband and I stayed here for two weeks in February 2009 and loved everything about it.  The staff, under the friendly guidance of Sergio, the manager, are all friendly and helpful. Sergio speaks good English, lives on site and is more than willing to assist with any travel plans and give information on surrounding area.  The hotel rooms are well cared for by the senoritas and kept very clean. The pool area and the garden are well groomed and always tidy. The only time we found it a little busy around the pool was at the end of the day, when it was a lovely spot to cool off after a walk home from the beach or some other adventure.It was always fun to share  information with the other guests. (By"
50,"My wife and I spent two weeks at Paraiso Escondido and loved it! We rented a suite for 8 days and planned on going somewhere else for the last 6 nights. After a few days we decided to stay there and nowhere else.  The hotel is perched on a hillside a few blocks from the beach.  The pool was nice and clean and so was our room. The view from our room was also quite nice.  The owner (Sergio) was very helpful and friendly. The staff was very pleasant as well. There is a restaurant on site which served good food at a reasonable price.  The hotel itself is just a cool, cool place. I wish I was better with words, but we were just completely relaxed there.  The only downside (for some people) may be the steps. It's an short, uphill walk from the Adoquin to the hotel and then there are a"
50,"Mi esposa y yo stayed here for 9 days this January. The hotel is perched on a hillside just above bahia principal and just below the main carretara. It is very close to Super Che, a large grocery and general store. The grounds are spacious, clean and adorned with what looked like to me, genuine Mayan or other indiginous limestone statuary. The pool is large and clean, the restaurant good, with friendly staff, and managed by Ernesto, who is very helpful and  has a good command of English. Sergio, the hotel general manager, also has good English and is equally helpful.The rooms are spotless, the sheets are changed daily, the air conditioning good, and the balconies afford good views of the bay. Close by are Banamex with an ATM, a laundromat, and many good restaurants, including"
50,"Our family of 4 visited Hotel Paraiso Escondido this past December for several days during our trip to Oaxaca.  We came here with our 2 young-adult daughters and stayed in one room together.  The hotel is very well run, well appointed and clean.  The management is very friendly and helpful, especially Sergio!     Our room was very comfortable - had a good balcony and the air conditioning was welcome late in afternoon when it got hot.  The only complaint I had about the accomodation was that the beds were made with a sheet directly on a plastic mattress cover which was a little crinkly and sticky, but no on else in the family was bothered by it, except me.  The hotel is at the end and just behind the main street that runs along the Playa Principal.  Since it is set back from the"
50,"My fiancé and I stayed here in 2008 and have nothing but good to say about the Paraiso.  It's located a short walk to the Playa Principal and the Adoquin but is tucked away in quiet little spot where you can get away from the crowds.  There's a bank and laundry about 50 metres away and it's also a short  walk to the Playa Manzanillo, which is a beautiful little beach where you can relax, catch a boat out to see dolphins (cheers Captain Omar!), etc.   Sergio the owner and the staff were great and the rooms were spotless and have air conditioning (believe me when I say that you'll need aircon if you're there in July)."
50,"Hotel Paraiso Escondido is the best place to stay in Puerto. All rooms have great views, but if you don't mind stairs, stay on the upper level rooms where the views of the bay and sounds of the sea are superb. The hotel is an easy walk to town or a cheap cab ride to the beach. The grounds are lovely and private with many colonial touches such as arches and altars. The manager went out of his way to help us find a car (Economica) and gave us the best advice for restaurants in the area. His English was perfect and all of the staff were kind and helpful.  The hotel is immaculately clean:they even iron the sheets. The lovely pool provides a wonderful respite after a day on the beach."
50,"We stayed with Sergio at the Hotel Paraiso Escondido for one night this past December.  The hotel was the cleanest 'local' Mexican hotel that I have ever visited.  While our room lacked any furniture (okay we did have a massive king sized bed, one tiny chair and a tv with 3 channels), we had an enormous sitting room sans sitting furniture and a very stately deck that was just dying for a good lounger or hammock, or both.   The price was reasonable (about $110 USD) and the food in their restaurant was well-prepared and tasty.  They had a nice pool area, too.   I would stay here again.  I would eat here again and I would definitely recommend it to others.  The air conditioning helped ease us into the heat of Puerto Escondido nicely, too.  Sergio was a great host."
50,We have been to the Paraiso Escondido from 27th of October till 4th of November 2007. We are an Austrian couple traveling through Mexico since 2003 two times a year (3-4 weeks each trip). We love the people and the country so much that we never will stop to visit Mexico. Altogether we have been approx 5 (!) months in our favorite country. We are a little  emulous of the people from Canada and USA because of the short distance. We have to fly 11.5 hrs one way. Whats this ?  It is for a better understanding of our message. As we have been in so many hotels in Mexico we can say the Paraiso Puerto Escondido is the best of all to us. 99 % of the others were also beautiful but we missed the spirit. We had reserved a junior suite which is in the 2nd floor. The owner itself was carrying
50,"We stayed at the Paraiso in 2006 and it has actually improved. Big screen TVs near the pool and in the reception area, and the grounds are more immaculate than ever. You could spend days here just admiring the the artistic flavor and statues that encompass the grounds. An english speaking owner make the stay much easier. Clearly the best hotel in Town for the money. However, the kitchen was not open during our stay, something that would help since we had to walk into town for coffee and breakfast."
50,"My wife and I stayed in 2011, we loved it! We enjoyed our stay so much that I recommended it to my parents, when they came back they had nothing negative to say. They loved the hotel and were very happy with the service they received from Adelina and her staff."
50,"We spent one week at the Quinta Lili - it was amazing!  The hotel is so peaceful, and the rooms and grounds were always kept spotless and well-stocked.  Adelina was there for us every morning to answer questions, help us decide where to go around town, or book excursions for us (the baby turtle-releasing was so cool!).  Breakfast was cereal, fresh fruit and juice, and a different Mexican hot dish each day - it was all delicious!  We stayed in the Master suite on the top floor, and it was an amazing space.  The best part was the little loft area with the lounge chairs and the spectacular view!  The only thing that broke the wonderful peace of the hotel were a few of the neighbourhood dogs that were a bit overenthusiastic when their owners were home (But Quinta Lili even went to"
50,"Quinta Lili was the perfect choice for our group. Making reservations was quick and easy. The communication with the staff prior to our arrival was perfect, resulting in a seamless pickup from the airport and quick arrival at the hotel. We had the whole property to ourselves, so we were given a tour of the grounds and an overview of Puerto upon arrival. All of the rooms were spacious, well kept, and very clean. The fresh breakfasts prepared by Adelina and Magda were fantastic. They were also able to help arrange activities for us. We had a great time at the spa/temezcal treatment Adelina set up for us. Releasing baby sea turtles was also a once in a lifetime activity that was set up through the hotel. It was a very memorable trip, and Quinta Lili will be our choice destination"
50,"Despite the fact we were informed in advance  through tripadvisor that QUINTALILI was a nice place to stay, we(I and mywife) were very much positively surprised. All  written reviews do not give you the real feeling and sense of the place. The calmness around the swimming pool, the generousity of the people ,the friendly spirit, the family atmosphere, the sincere hospitality you feel(not strictly professional) add a very great value to this place.But to me the most valuable asset of this boutique hotel are  Louis,Claire and Adelina.They all make you feel at home. I have to confess that we spent a lot of time talking to these nice people ,especially Adelina who happened to spend more time taking care of us(excellent mexican breakfasts with the help of lovely Magdalena). Needless"
50,"Hotel Quinta Lili was a lovely surprise! The hostess Adelina, and Magda a housekeeper were warm, welcoming, and very helpful. The property is gorgeous, unique and immaculately clean, as are the rooms and pool. Our Master Bedroom was spacious and beautifully designed – nice touches with colorful ceramic tiles, additional floor level above, and a private jacuzzi. We had a great view at the pacific ocean from our two main big windows at sunrise and during the day and at sunset while in jacuzzi - what a great way to end the day! The oaxacan style breakfasts served everyday between 8 and 10 am were really good and filling (please see pictures) – it's also a great place to socialize with newcomers who come from around the world. We loved that the hotel was located just few minutes"
50,"My husband and I stay in Quinta Lili for seven days. The breakfasts were delicious, lots of coffee and juice and fresh fruit and special dishes from the region every morning. Adelina is an excellent cook.    Our room was large and very comfortable and extremely clean. But more than that it was beautifully and cleverly decorated and designed. The tiled walls were brightly coloured and there were swan towels on the beds. There was care taken with each beautiful detail of decor.   The hotel is a three minute walk from the beach. There are lots of good restaurants within a five minute walk. The hotel afforded the chance to meet people or to be private and on your own, depending on your mood. We met a number of really lovely people while we were there.       Adelina and Magda were"
50,"I stayed at Quinta lilli for 5 days in feb 2013and had a great time. The hotel is small and in a quiet part of Puerto Escondido and was wonderfully relaxing.  I arrived at  8am and was immediately welcomed by Magda and a cup of coffee. A delicious breakfast soon followed with a different local dish every day and being a vegetarian was absolutely no problem. Adelina is a perfect host and explained all the local facilities whilst not bearing over-bearing. Her English is fantastic and Magda was very patient whilst I tried to speak in Spanish! As a solo traveller I particularly liked the communal feel of breakfast and enjoyed the opportunity of using the lap pool at the nearby sister hotel, Vlilla Lilli."
50,"Picture yourself in a room with french doors that open to a patio overlooking a wonderful swimming pool.  In the background soft instrumental music plays all day and evening.  The facility is walled and on a quiet street with safe parking in front of the gate.  This B&B has 5 rooms on three levels, two on each side with a suite on the top floor.  There is a wonderful palapa covered kitchen area by the pool and across from that is a palapa covered sitting and dining area. At night the pool lights change color as do the wonderful onyx lights around the garden area.  The breakfast served was excellent with fresh fruit and juices.  One morning we had freshly prepared fish tacos with julliene carrots and thin slices of cucumber on homemade tortillas.  Another, were corn tortillas"
50,"It was a fantastic place for our honey moon. Since we arrived Adelina took care of us as if we were family. She gave us excellent advices of what to do in Puerto Escondido. Quinta Lilli is a very nice hotel, with a charming ambience. The breakfast included is a nice way to taste local food of great quality. I highly recommend it"
50,"My husband and I stayed at Quinta Lili for 5 nights in early Jan 2013. We were very quickly made to feel at home by Magda and Adelina with a fresh drink after which Adelina took time to take us through the map of Puerto Escondido highlighting all the best spots to eat and drink etc. We especially appreciated the breakfasts each morning, both for the quality of the food but also for the chance to chat with Adelina, who was always a pleasure to speak to and get to know. We stayed in the sunrise room and enjoyed chilling out on the large balcony. The room was nicely furnished with a large double bed. Temperature control was perfect with the option of the ceiling fan and Adelina also kindly provided us with a smaller stand-up fan also. We found the hotel nice and quiet and relaxing"
50,"My husband read about this hotel in a travel magazine and wanted to go there for a beach vacation. Our week at Puerto Escondido has been great , even if this part of Mexico, is not the easiest place to get to. This hotel is beautiful, everything is very clean and well maintained, the service is attentive and very professional . I highly recommend Villas Carrizalillo if you want  a top class hotel."
40,"should be fixed asap! Paying 200 USD per night you should not be confronted with stairs so uneven (""chuecos"") that older people or pregnant women put their health in risk."
50,"Visited Puerto Escondido for a 2nd time this past March and have to say the place to stay is Villas Carrizalillo! The views are spectacular - loved our room which looked out on the water - Colorado.The owners and staff are just as amazing - we were there for about 2 weeks and made us feel part of the family immediately.  Loved walking down the steps to the fabulous Playa Carrizalillo. Relaxed, ate, read and learned how to surf at this great beach. At the end of the day, would walk up the steps, have a happy hour margarita and watch the sun set. Really was so wonderful.   A new chef arrived during our stay and was totally wowed - the best meal(s) during our entire trip! The food was so fresh and service was excellent. Can't wait for our next trip as  I will definitely be back to"
50,"Very accommodating staff here.  They were remodeling the 7 days before our stay, and they were not technically open the first night, but I talked them into it since it looked so beautiful and I didn't want to switch hotels.  They were very accommodating.  Room was clean and ready when we arrived.  The grounds were immaculate all the time.  The view is amazing!  I would stay here again if I come back to P.E.  I would stay nowhere else.  The restaurant is the best we had in town, so decadent, the view is amazing and the chief must be a genius.  Loved this place."
50,"I was one of 4 families with 10 teenagers that spent two weeks at this villa.  It was fantastic.  Lots of relaxing for adults and lots of adventure for the kids to find.  The service was exceptional, Amy and her staff were very helpful and informative.  It is close to everything,  and the handy bikes were a quick and easy way to do some exploring.  We had a room at the back because we were the largest family.  This at first disappointed me, but the trade off was we had the biggest kitchen and the most spacious unit.  There are so many beautiful common areas to see the water and listen to the surf I got over not having a water view almost immediately.  Besides, the view out our back windows looked right out of a Clint Eastwood movie...."
50,"My friend read about this hotel in ""Outdoors"" magazine and wanted to go there for a beach vacation.  Although Puerto Escondido, Mexico,  is not the easiest place to get to, our stay there made it well worth the while.  This hotel is delightful in every way.  We had our own little 2 bedroom apt., complete with living room and kitchen.  Red tile roofs, lovely gardens with bubbling fountains, a patio with a killer view of the swimming beach below as well as gorgeous sunsets, a very good restaurant, and for those so inclined, great margaritas, beer and pina coladas.  Oh, I must mention the lovely swimming pool and sun deck where I spent many happy hours.  Yes, we did go into town, but Villas Carrizalillo is the sort of place you wonder if you really need to leave!  The staff is"
40,"Try to get an ocean front room. The walk down to the great beach is no problem. The location, twenty minutes walk from the town centre,is a plus because town centre is nothing to write home about. Plus taxis are everywhere and cheap. Rooms have basic kitchen facilities so lay in the drink fixings. Restaurant is great. and the hotel generally has a ""private-club"" feel to it. The only negative is Price---US prices ($190), but Mexican plumbing (no paper allowed down the toilet)."
50,"On the one hand, I hesitate to write about this exquisite property in fear that it will become too popular, and we'll never be able to secure a reservation. But after years of travelling all over Mexico, we have finally found our place, and we want to tell the world. Villas Carrizalillo, from the impeccable grounds and comfortable rooms to the service that's always efficient but never in your face, can do no wrong. It has the right combination of laid back beach with understated elegance. The hotel arranged for us to picked up at the Huatulco airport (a two hour ride away ) even though we ended up delayed and arrived at the ungodly hour of 3 AM. This alone is noteworthy. Ideally situated above Carrizalillo Bay, the rooms afford gorgeous sunset views for cocktail hour and stairs"
50,I traveled with two young children and our stay was wonderful. Personal was wonderful. The rooms were very clean. The only thing that I did not like was the restaurant did not have a variety of food. The beach was wonderful. I would highly recommend
50,"This property seizes the opportunities presented by the cliffs over Playa Carrizalillo.  This creates stunning views and the need to climb a bit to get to the beach.  For rooms without a deck or that are set back from the edge of the cliff, there are several public areas with chairs and hammocks.  The property has expanded in the past few years and the newest rooms have the most amenities and, probably, the best views.  The amenities vary considerably from room to room (as do the views), so it's worth doing some advance research to see what style of room best meets your needs.    The additions included a pool, an elevated sundeck, and a restaurant (operated by a couple who used to own a restaurant by the same name in the nearby shopping plaza)."
50,"this is our second trip to a most perfect place.  The inn keeper is always making sure that everything you need is there for you but doing it in a way that you don't notice.  the Ladies working there in the daytime only want to make your stay comfortable & stress free.  Love it, love it. the only problem is I don't know if I can wait to get back there."
50,"This place is like an oasis. From the outside it looks nothing special but once inside then 'wow'. The architecture is quirky - it could have been designed by Antonio Gaudi. Our room on the second floor with a balcony was perfect. I gather, the owner Luis lives in the US but his communication was constantly on the ball. His sister, Adelina was the perfect hostess - she just couldn't have been more helpful.  She organised a bird-watching trip for us using a local guide. This turned out to be one of the best things we did during our month in Mexico and there were plenty of other great experiences too.  The breakfasts were wonderful & varied.  It's a pity we were only able to spend 2 nights.  If only all hotels & B&Bs were run like this!"
50,"Such a wonderful place to stay on holiday. Adelina is the perfect hostess - she really looks after you like an old friend and is genuinely happy to have you there, as well as being a total sweetheart. She took us one sunset with some other guests to release just-hatched baby turtles into the surf - magic!! And Luis is wonderful too after taking me to his chiropractor twice - greatly appreciated.  We had the enormous 'Exotica' room with wonderful views of the sea and sunsets, an enormous bathroom with hot tub and waterfall and great breezes through to cool you down. It's worth the extra for the bigger rooms as they are spectacular.  Breakfast is a treat with the friendly chef cooking a different Mexican speciality every morning. And because it's a small place you get to meet the"
50,"I chose to stay at Villa Lili based on all those awesome TripAdvisor recommendations, and now I can do little but echo them once again.  No doubt about it, Adelina and Luis are ideal hosts -- welcoming, helpful, friendly, and very interesting.    The breakfast is wonderful, including some different special cooked dish every day. The rooms are bright and cheery.  The pool and breakfast areas are ideal for milling with other interesting guests.    It's a short walk to the top of a cliff overlooking Carizalillo beach, and then many steps down to the beach.  At the bottom of all those steps you are rewarded by a beach that is close to perfection -- an incredibly beautiful cove, uncrowded, with a perfect little string of low-key, inexpensive shacks where you can get a place to sit,"
50,"I cannot say enough great things about Villa Lili. This is one of the most memorable places I have ever stayed. My boyfriend and I just returned from a 1-week stay, and we wish we could have stayed longer. We booked this hotel on the strength of the TripAdvisor recommendations and we could not be happier. Luis was very professional and prompt about the whole booking process over email. Adelina is a great hostess; she made us feel at home right away and was helpful in offering lots of recommendations about restaurants, beaches, and activities. The daily breakfast is OUTSTANDING and includes fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh fruits, yogurt, cereal, excellent coffee, AND a different delicious entree every day--all homemade by the outstanding cook, Doña Irene. The guest rooms are"
50,"Like another reviewer has said, when the taxi stopped out the front of this place on a dirt road in front of a locked gate, I gave my boyfriend a terrible glare (thinking he had made a BIG mistake!!). Oh how I was wrong! From the outside you really wouldn't believe the haven that the brother & sister team have created inside!  From the pool one morning I watched Adelina carefully hand wipe each of her orchids - they are her babies :)The attention to detail of this place will blow you away. From the coloured tiles scattered amongst the stone staircase to the fresh flowers on the bed.   We stayed in 2 different rooms during our stay. One night we were in what I believe is the smallest room and if you are on a budget, this room would be perfect! Although it doesn't have a window"
50,"We saw all of the great reviews on tripadvisor and had to see for ourselves.We were not disappointed.Stayed in the lovely Exotica room on the third floor.Great ocean view.Wonderful cool breezes in the mornings and afternoons.Really a fabulous accomodation.Adelina was the perfect hostess.Always available to offer advice on beaches, restaurants and shopping.Offered us the use of her laptop and phone when we lost our bank card.Even gave us a lift to a favorite restaurant outside of town.She really does make you feel at home.Always laughing and smiling,a welcome sight in the mornings at breakfast.Speaking of breakfast:Irena and Maria served up wonderful Oaxacan b-fasts every morning,and helped to make our stay even more friendly and welcoming.Villa Lili is also very close to Playas"
50,"Arrival by taxi on the dirt road might give you an unsettling feeling at first but once behind the securely locked front gate of Villa Lili, the whole mood changes. The walls are flanked with orchids tended to by Adelina (owner) herself. The long, glistening lap pool is the perfect conversation pool. Everything is so perfectly clean and fresh and the gardens so beautifully pruned, it's like a picture postcard. The staff is not just friendly, they are like family. The outdoor lighting at night is a technicolor dream with mood music and handsome, comfortable furniture surrounding the social hour bar area. The rooms are bright and airy, some with large balconies for friends to gather and view the ocean view sunsets. There are 6 different beaches to explore - all within walking"
50,"This is my second time back to Villa Lilli and in all my travels (over 20 countries) it is the best accommodation experience I have had. Possibly because it encapsulates all the best of Mexico: tranquility, beautiful design, warm and welcoming hosts, and delicious food. The cleanliness is outstanding. On a return trip, you feel like you are coming back to old friends. I also brought friends from Guatemala on this trip, and they were extremely well looked after. Adelina lives for her guests- she took me to some beautiful places around Puerto to take photos and made sure that my friends and I did wonderful things every day. Everything is set up so that you can completely an utterly relax. This place is really special to me and I will be returning as soon as I can. "
50,Everything is perfect: the hosts are lovely the staff is obliging and the ambience is ideal. The beach at Carrizalillo is about five mins wlak way and the swimming there is a delight. If you have to go into town you can do it with a 20peso taxi or a ten min walk. I stayed a week.
50,"We stayed in Puerto on and off for a week, but used the Swiss oasis as a base and loved.  Manuela and Rene amazing hosts, very helpful, above and beyond.  They know the area extremely well, are travelers themselves and will be able to help you with any query.  The hotel itself is seconds from the beach, its super clean with an incredibly friendly and laid back atmosphere, not to mention affordable.  I will be back ex New Zealand for sure"
50,Such a wonderful place to stay!! The rooms are very clean and the owners are fabulous people. They are very helpful and have managed to create a little gem of a place. The Hotel is close to beach and restaurants. It is also relaxing lounging by the pool with a few beers I will stay here again any time.
50,"Likes  Great location for Puerto Escondido for beach, bars, restaurants and shops. Conveniently located for transport in and out of area. Amazing chill out areas including pool.  Great friendly owners. Very very clean inside and outside areas. Rooms well decorated, clean and comfortable.  Dislikes  None"
50,"My boyfriend and I are currently backpacking around Mexico and couldn't believe it when this spot came up on our hostel app - the reviews were all so great, we were amazed that it was in budget!  Everything everyone else has said is true - rooms are lovely, spacious and clean; communal areas are gorgeous and perfectly maintained (especially the blissful pool!); and, above all, Manuela and Rene are exemplary hosts. Nothing is too much trouble and they truly make the hotel feel like a home away from home.  We also booked two tours/activities through the hotel which were we're both great - surfing and a boat ride. I'd recommend them both - much more personal than the options offered out on the beach. My boyfriend also injured his shoulder while we were there and they had a great"
50,"This place is awesome - has the best of both worlds with a backpacker vibe (youngish crowd, social, communal kitchen etc) but you get a nice private hotel room and its much quieter and cleaner than a backpackers.  We booked a double and got a massive king bed with an ensuite and there was an attic type floor upstairs which could have slept another two people in singles.  This place is immaculately clean, the rooms are a bit rustic with palapa roofs etc which is lovely.  It's not fancy but you really don't want fancy in Puerto and for the price the value is amazing. Location is probably the best in town, very very close to the surf beach and nightlife but one street back so you don't get the noise.  Also no kids allowed which was great for us. Pool area is exceptionally well"
50,"This is one of my new favourite places to stay in Mexico, and I can't wait to go back....it was such a nice and lovely visit! The lush garden, the lovely pool, the cosy and spacious rooms and friendly Manuela and Rene as your hosts, this is just the perfect combination for a really wonderful and relaxing stay. Had chosen Swiss Oasis after seing all the beautiful photos and the numerous good reviews and we certainly did'nt regret it, only that we had'nt planned for a longer stay in Puerto Escondido. The Oasis is just a block from the main street on Zicatela beach which makes it peaceful but still very central. Just loved the garden with the beautiful flowers and the pool was perfect for a refreshing afternoon dip when you got back hot and tired from the beach or the city. The"
50,"Walking into the gorgeous courtyard with its beautiful swimming pool, sun beds, umbrellas, tropical flowers, hammocks and other guests all sitting around chatting made us feel like we'd come to the right place. Manuela is the perfect hostess and was like a second mum, giving us the local insight, best food and market recommendations and gossip while showing us our room.. The beds/pillows are great, the shower amazing,  everything is spotless and the communal kitchen downstairs is wonderful. A 20 second walk to the beach and right in the middle of the action, we can not recommend this place highly enough and hope to return someday."
50,"After our arrival in Puerto Escondido, we checked out several different hotels and locations. We choose the Swiss Oasis because they had the nicest and cleanest rooms/bathrooms and the location was perfect. The Hotelito is a vey cosy, friendly hideout with great hosts and guests. The pool, the room, the bathroom, all spotless clean. A good water preasure in the shower (hot water) allowed me to wash my long hair whenever I want. The rooms have windows on both sides, covered with moskito screen, so we could leave the window open and there was always a nice breeze so that we even did'nt need the good working celling fan. The big kingsize bed is very cosy and it's so nice and quiet, we had the best sleep during all our America trip. We first planed to stay only 4 nights...now it's 2"
50,"Lovely room, comfy bed, relaxing pool, friendly, helpful people.  On arrival (early in the morning) there was a bathroom and towels available for us to use until our room was ready. We could relax at the pool while Manuela welcomed us and gave us plenty of information and advice. Just what we needed after a long journey. They really have thought of everything here."
40,"A great little spot just off the main street of Zacateras Beach.   Eight rooms border the pool, common kitchen, and pleasant sitting area.     The rooms are all very similar in design and style with the top rooms having a nice little patio out back to enjoy the warm and tranquil evenings.   They don't have an ocean view but their location is perfect for being close to everything (1/2 block from restaurants and the beach) yet quiet and peaceful.  The drink cooler (providing beer, pop and water) is on the honor system and a really nice amenity even though there are numerous stores and restaurants nearby.   Same with the kitchen facilities – it's a nice option to be able to prepare your own meals, even if it is only a coffee or snack by the pool.       The Swiss owners are"
50,"My husband and I stayed at Vivo Resorts from 8/31/17 - 9/6/17 and we just loved it. So much so that I play to return again next year with 3 girlfriends for a girls week. The setting is remote and quiet, but you can still get to town pretty easily. The staff is exceptional and the Chef is priceless. Their farm/sea to table philosophy makes every mean absolutely delicious. So excited to be able to experience the new club house during our next visit. You will not be disappointed if you stay at Vivo Resorts."
50,"From the moment Jesus picked us up from the airport, we knew that this trip would be amazing. We were greeted with bright smiles by everyone and felt truly welcomed, safe and relaxed! The staff is truly amazing! Vivo has a unspoiled beach, and this resort is the only hotel on a long stretch of sand, which gives it a paradise status! No outside vendors or crowds of tourists, such a peaceful oasis. We were in a very tastefully decorated 2 bedroom/2 bathroom unit on the 4th floor in Building D with full ocean front views. Everything is high-end finishings, granite countertops and beautiful stainless steel appliances (full size), nice tile floors, comfortable furnishings in good taste. The restaurant is an outdoor setting at the moment, but will be moved to the club house upon"
50,"Great service, beautiful scenario. The beach is Perfect for surfers. The laguna Manialtepec and its own natural beauty, like the luminescens show, A great surprise is that the people in Oaxaca is making a great effort to keep the place clean and cultivate themselves. No many places in Mexico are clean. "
50,"I visited Puerto Escondido ma any times in the distant past and stayed right on the principal beach. Doing my research ahead of time, it appeared to me that staying right on the principal beach was no longer particularly desirable because it looked like it had become overcrowded. On trip advisor I found this hotel and decided to stay there despite its considerable distance from the town.  Our family could not have been happier to stay  at Vivos.  the resort is located on pristine beach and is spectacular. We could not have been any happier, the restaurant is great and the food is very fresh. Unlike most resort food, it was very reasonably priced.  I rate this resort a 5+. Really, the only hiccup was that the Internet was horrible. The resort is a bit far out of town and if you"
50,"We had a great time, very clean , shutle service to puerto escondido,has a inside store for basics , fuul kitchen with all apliances and everything you need, small tv for my taste and internet though is free is complicated and slow ,have to be changing servers all the time and need to put code in, nice pools, very clean and brand new condos, very relaxed ambience, this is a place to relax, if you are looking for action , this is not the place, no smoking allowed on premises or rooms, Great for family quality time and relaxation, the beach is nice but roughf sea , only for pros. Thanks had a great time"
40,"A 'premium' room is a must since they're oceanfront, otherwise you're near an active construction site where they're building the clubhouse. Once we moved to an oceanfront room we were in heaven and loved the entire experience.   Don't let the drive in worry you: you turn off the main highway, down on to a desolate dirt road and drive for about 10 minutes making all kinds of turns with the one reassurance you're not in danger being little Vivo Resort signs. Once you arrive you're then faced with a huge construction site.. get past this part and you'll be happy you stuck with it.  Our room was one of the nicest I've ever stayed in. The huge balcony faced the most amazing and undeveloped Oaxacan view of the ocean and the mountains. Brand new finishes inside with a luxurious walk"
50,"If you are looking for a quiet beach resort area in Mexico, this quality resort has all the amenities for an excellent value. Beautiful, friendly, great food with a town nearby to experience the local culture and see the surfers!"
50,"Amazing staff, wonderful rooms, excellent food and service at the restaurant, beautiful views!!!! I arrived at 1am during a huge rainstorm. The staff greeted me at the car, with an umbrella, so I wouldn't get wet. "
50,"Wasn't a spring break atmosphere but the kids were quite impressed and they all said it was what was needed after their exams. Nightlife and the town is only a shuttle ride away but most nights they wanted to stay at the resort. 513 is a great 4 bedroom condo (5 beds, 2 king and 3 queen and 3 bathrooms) Also a great location, poolside and beachfront with unobstructed views. Great for large families or couples sharing. The clubhouse is scheduled for completion for December 2017 which will have a restaurant, bar, gym, massages, business center.... we will be back for sure. the town of Puerto Escondido is charming, and there are so many different beaches to visit. We are very pleased to hear that this resort and the owners have started a foundation and give back to the local"
50,I have discovered paradise... Awesome service. Everyone knows you by name within one day... Our condo was very nice right by the pool... My family came from Brazil and had the best time of their lives...  
10,"I was spending some time travelling with my son a few weeks ago. The trip was organised suddenly and time was short; I did some research on Trip Advisor just before leaving and then booked this hotel by paying $80 deposit.  We flew a few days later and arrived by taxi at 8.15am. A very pleasant man whom we later observed to be the gardener let us in through the security gate and indicated that we should sit on the balcony seat outside the unoccupied reception office.  No-one had appeared by the time we decided to leave over 30 minutes later, after an unsuccessful journey out in the back lanes trying to find anywhere to buy breakfast. No explanation, no sign of an impending arrival from anyone from management...just some pleasant staff attending to their jobs in the very"
50,"Casamar is like a beautiful oasis!  From the gorgeous gardens, the pristine pool, impeccably clean rooms, and outstanding service by the staff--nothing could have been improved upon.  Our stay there was just perfect!  We LOVE Puerto Escondido, and have been going there for years.  Now that we have found Casamar we will go to Puerto far more often.  Feels like a home away from home! Thank you, Willits, and all your amazing staff for taking such good care of your guests."
50,"How can I start describing my experience and my girlfriend in Casamar, I guess the easiest way to describe is to say it was a 10 out from 10. Casamar is located in Zicatella a couple of blocks away from La Punta. The complex is a quiet and peacefull place, its well decorated and the staff does it best to make you feel at home. I stay in two rooms, both of them fully equiped and really nice. The manager is a really good guy that would encougare you to perform some of the many free activities the Hotel has for the guests, for example Yoga. The swimming pool is awsome and the gardens are beautiful. Looking for another hotel for a friend of mine I investigate some other ones near Casamar and there is no doubt Casamar plays on another league. Hope my reviews help,   Alberto and Erica."
50,"This complex is lovely, well situated and a real haven.  The staff is friendly, able and ever vigilant to the needs of the guests.  They seem sincerely interested in making sure the guests are comfortable and happy.  They did an excellent job in helping me sojourn to Oaxaca City for a couple of days sending me off with Captain Vega who pilots a lovely twin engine plane for a very affordable price.  Our apartment was well furnished, quite comfortable and quiet.  The maids were excellent in every way.  The owner has a meet and greet on Monday evenings in his apartment and it was interesting meeting the other guests, many of whom had great life stories.  Many of the guests were repeat guests over the years.  I definitely recommend the Casamar."
50,"I cannot really add to the many positives written by others about this hotel.However I will add a couple of points not previously mentioned.If you are a beach walker (or jogger) then this is for you as it is quite a long beach and the sand is in itself walk-able.The rooms (at least the one we stayed in) have large screened windows and doors at the front and a screened opening at the back.This front/back screening allows for a cross breeze which coupled with the excellent room fans and landscaping did not require us to use the air conditioner at all.I do not agree with a previous comment   that the hotel is situated in a rough looking neighbourhood but rather a typical one where sandy streets are the norm.Also,the Amoki restauant , where you likely will have your included"
40,"Since we were visiting Huatulco before, which is cleaner and more family-friendly in terms of streets and security, Puerto Escondido appeared to us to be a rougher turf. When we took the cab towards Casamar, the road and area looked dusty and pretty rural with dogs chasing around others between empty buildings. The Casamar is located next to the beach and is a wonderful place with a beautiful pool and large rooms that can house many. Cooking is possible in the rooms and with a mini.market not far, we used it frequently since the offered breakfast, which is not in the Casamar but a walk down the dusty road in a little place called Amoki, has not been an option for us since my girlfriend had already trouble with the food and the Amoki offered mostly eggs and honestly, did not look"
50,"Casamar is a great place to stay in Puerto Escondido. You are next to the Pacific Ocean in the quite part of Puerto Escondido (Punta). It is a very nice place with many ""alternative people"". Casamar is a beutiful place to stay. Everything is very clean and I like very much the staff and the owner. The design of the suites is very colorful in a Mexican traditional style. You can enjoy time in a hamac in the tropical garden with swimming pool, take some yoga or dance classes and enjoy a beautiful sunset on the Pacific - sometimes on the terrace on the roof of the building while Will (very nice owner) is welcoming all his guest with a drink and snacks as an ""gettogether"". The rooms are very nice and are very well equiped with kitchen and you will be able to cook for yourself in"
50,"Casamar was recommended to us from some new found friends who had just stayed there. We booked in for 2 nights and ended up staying for over 2 weeks because the place is an absolute oasis in beautiful Puerto Escondido. The owners have designed, built and decorated all the rooms and common areas to make you feel right at home and they have done an outstanding job. The owners are both caring and considerate and it was a real pleasure to meet them. The staff from reception were always friendly and very knowledgeable and helped us to organize and explore a large part of Oaxaca state. We made Casamar our base for our month in Mexico and while we explored the mountains and Oaxaca city the owners let us store our surfboards and extra luggage for free. It was always so nice to return to"
50,"i dtayed 2 times in this garden hotel with its beautyful swimming pool. for me the big garden in the quiet neigbourhood is unique. I loved justtobein the garden and watch the huming birds, the palms nadthe flowers. My room was veryclean all the time and the kitchen was well equiped, so that I could cook easely, make my shakes in the blender and make my morning cofe in the cafe mashine. the stuff is very friendly and the offer all kind of aktivities. my,room was  very stylishly decorated with hand painted tails amazing pictures and confortable beds. Itis a place that I enjoyed a lot."
20,"After staying at Casamar Suites i had real mixed feelings about it. The rooms are clean, comfortable and look fantastic. Thats not what I am writing this review about.  I am writing a review to tell you an experience I had with the owner one night. The owners organized a 'meet and greet' evening, it was a few hours where everyone can have a chat with one another and enjoy a cocktail made by the owners.  It was all going well until, the male owner had obviously had a few drinks and made a few remarks about his past career and experiences that I found racist and very arrogant. I was extremely shocked by these comments and would like to warn people.  Also, I being male was asked to join a 'Mens only bible meeting'. I have no problem with religion in the slightest but i found this"
50,"We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Hotel Paraiso Escondido.  Everything about our stay was fabulous.  The owner was very helpful.  The staff were always friendly and smiling.  The room was extremely comfortable and clean.  The architecture and details of the hotel are unique and charming.  We loved relaxing by the pool and swimming.  The view from the hotel property is gorgeous and it enjoys a refreshing breeze as it is set on a hill.  The rooms are air conditioned, have hot water and receive maid service daily.  The owner can tell you about all the beaches in the area and how to get to them and can arrange things like surfing lessons if you want.  We paid 650 pesos per night which I felt was a great value.  I'm sure that the rate is higher during Christmas and Semana"
50,"Beautiful property, just splendid.  Great room, comfy and clean with amazing art all around.  Loved swimming in the pool, terrific staff.  Just loved it. "
40,"I stayed at the Paraiso in July with my family.  We took two rooms and all in all, we were comfortable and happy.  Rooms have AC.  The staff were very pleasant and helpful.  If you have a car, like we did, you can park for free in the hotel's parking lot.  Rooms are clean, and come with a small TV that picks up local stations.  The beds are probably the only minor complaint, as they are a little past their sell-by date!  The pool (and the kiddie pool) are fantastic and they are a nice treat at the end of the day.  The hotel is a 5-minute walk to the beach, which is close, while being just far enough away from the noise of the main strip. "
50,"We just spent two wonderful days at the Quinta Lili.  Located in a very nice area of Puerto Escondido, close to the beautiful beaches and lots of restaurants.  Our second floor room had a view of the Pacific.  A very nice pool, kitchen area, ""honor"" cooler, quiet soothing music and wonderful hosts made this one of the best B&Bs we have ever experienced.  Our king size bed was very comfortable as were the pillows.  Lots and lots of very hot water.  Great Oaxacan breakfasts.  You won't be sorry."
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Quinta Lili for 5 days in early January 2013. After arriving on an overnight bus from Oaxaca City we were quite exhausted and were able to use our room straight away despite it still being early morning. We were also offered breakfast which is one of the highlights at Quinta Lili! Magdelina makes the best Mexican breakfasts that are definitely worth getting up for, she is also very sweet. The room itself was nicely decorated, with a huge bed and balcony. They are cleaned everyday by Magdelina and she couldn't do a better job. Being backpackers we had stuff everywhere and arriving back to the room on the first night, we found that Magedlina had folded all our clothes and put them in the drawers and wardrobe, we were speechless. Quinta Lili itself is"
50,"Quinta Lilli exceeded our expectations! Very authentic and laid back atmosphere. We stayed 5 days in the master suite. Beautiful, clean and spacious room. The host Adelina and Magdalena, the housekeeper, made sure we got everything we needed every single day! The breakfast was authentic oaxacan food, delicious... We will definitely return"
50,"We spent ten days aty Quinta Lili and enjoyed our stay very much.  The room was spacious and comfortable, the pool refreshing, Magda',s breakfasts amazing.  Most especially, the attentive service by Adelina (helping with banking, excursions, tickets, etc.) made the stay at Quinta Lili delightful."
50,"We stayed in the master suite for almost 2 weeks at the end of our around the world honeymoon jan 2013. We were stoked as it was a place were we could really wind down. The rooms are very clean and the housekeeper, Magda, does an amazing job looking after the place and the guests and she is always smiling! So nice!!   We really appreciated learning so much about Mexico from Adelina. We had so many questions about the country, culture, language, people and land and she really took the time to explain many things to us. Also, Adelina is very bubbly and always has a smile too! Nothing was too hard!!  Towards the end of our stay I got pretty sick from a restaurant and didn't eat for 2 days. Adelina and Magda showed great concern and really kept an eye out for me. Adelina went and"
50,We had an fantastic stay at Quinta Lili and in Puerto Escondido. The villa is beautiful and Adelina and Magdalena we're amazing hosts. The dolphin watching tour and the baby turtle release are great excursions. Thanks guys we hope to come back one day!  
50,"My wife I use this property regularly to get away from Mexico City. We love the friendliness of the hosts & the breakfast is beautiful. We look forward to returning ASAP. Puerto Escondido is our favourite place in Mexico, the beaches and town are not over run and Americanised like other coastal resort area, the feel is laid back and very authentic,"
50,"What a welcome. We arrived way before checkin at 7:45am and within 20 minutes had been picked up by a courtesy car from the airport, shown to our room and sat round the outside breakfast bar being served a delicious fresh breakfast, way beyond our expectations. Quinta is on the quiet end of town, a 5 minute walk from probably the nicest and least crowded beach. A 5 minute taxi into the main town is cheap and easy to get, so there is no disadvantage in being a little bit out. Plenty of shops and restaurants within a 5 minute walk so no need to go to town at all if you don't fancy it. Hotel is spotlessly clean and comfortable and the owners went out of their way to help us organise whatever we wanted. There is no permanent reception, so it feels like being in a serviced private"
50,"My wife and I stayed a week at Quinta Lili in November 2012.  We had a fantastic time and were thoroughly impressed with the accommodation.  Puerto Escondido is a perfect - not overly tourist but plenty to do.  The lack of commercialization was very nice as it allows for a feel of the local culture.  Breakfast every morning was fantastic.  I'm a foodie and completely impressed with the traditional breakfasts.  That alone was worth the trip.  No joke.  Getting around is simple.  There's no need to rent a car, etc.  Just take the taxi anywhere you want to go.  Most fares are 20-25 pesos, which, in our opinion, was very affordable.  There are several beaches that you can go to.  We visited a different one each day.  There are restaurants on just about every beach which makes it a"
50,"Quinta Lili is an excellent boutique hotel with 5 rooms. We stayed there 10 days from Nov.14-23, 2012. It has an endearing charm in every respect....and very good value for the money. We stayed in the  2nd floor 'Sunrise' room, with firm king bed, big balcony with view of the area and sea. No A/C, but the ceiling fans make it comfortable as do the offshore breeze in the evening and throughout the night.  The property is extremely well maintained and clean with a small lap pool which is very refreshing after a day at the beach. Playa Carizalillo is only a 5 minute walk away and Playa Manzanillo, just 10 minutes. Both are spectacular and safe beaches for swimming with palapas, beach chairs and beer/food service. There are many good restaurants close by on the Riconada, within easy"
50,"We stayed here 4 nights during our visit to Puerto Escondido.  We stayed in the Villa Colarada, which had a great porch and a spectacular view of the beach. The room was spotless, well furnished, good internet service, nice TV, and air conditioning and fans that you controlled yourself.   The service was great and the restaurant had excellent food.  We bought cereal and ate breakfast in our room.  The room came with ground coffee and a coffee maker.  it is only a short walk (1/3 mile) to stores and the bank.  The hotel could easily call a taxi if you wanted to go further afield  Or if you started to walk to town a taxi would be there in a minute to see if you preferred to ride..

Villas Carrizalillo was the perfect spot for my 5 day getway, perfect place to unwind, relax, and enjoy the spectacular surroundings and views of the amazing beach.  I had everything I needed at my Villa, spent most of the day on the beach below.  The service in general was excellent, the hotel management and reception perfectly nice, charming, attentive and unobtruvise.  Complimentary internet and coffee a big plus.    The food at the restaurant Los Tugas was EXCELLENT.  A limited selection, but everything was great, although I had hoped to see some regional Oaxacan dishes.  The"
50,"Villas Carrizalillo is simply amazing.  The villas are set in beautiful grounds with the most spectacular views of beautiful Carrizalillo beach.  We stayed in Colorado which is a huge suite/villa with an incredibly comfortable, enormous bed, extremely spacious bathroom with a lovely powerful shower, lounge area and small kitchenette area (sink, fridge, filtered water).  But possibly the greatest thing the suite has is a huge balcony, complete with seating area and hammock but best of all, incredible views and the sound of the sea.  The place is spotless and the staff really friendly and happy to help with any queries.  Villas Carrizalillo has a nice pool, it's not huge but is perfect to cool off in the searing Puerto Escondido heat.  There are a few different terrace areas for"
50,"I stayed at Villas Carrizalillo with my husband and 2 other couples at the end of May 2010. Unfortunately we only stayed there one night since it was our last night back from camping in Chacagua National Park.  The hotel is absolutely wonderful, as you can read in previous reviews. The staff is very friendly, the grounds are beautiful, the deck and bar are just incredible to hang out at sunset. The pool offers a nice change from the ocean. The restaurant has great vistas and a good menu. One of the things I loved about the hotel is that it is amazingly romantic yet very family friendly!  The calm beach at Playa Carrizalillo was a nice change from other Puerto Escondido (and in general other Pacific beaches) where the waves and currents are insane. Since I don't surf I find it"
50,"My husband and I stayed at Villas Carrizalillo in Feb 2010.  We stayed for 6 days in a beautiful, private villa with awesome ocean views. Our villa was self contained and had everything we needed. It was modern and spacious with character.  All the resort staff from reception, housekeeping, bar & restaurant are very friendly and helpful, even though our Spanish was not very good. The resort has a great bar that is positioned in a perfect spot for having a cocktail on sunset plus a restaurant on the cliff that has a romantic setting. The food is divine!  We will be back as soon as we can. It is a shame we live far away in Australia otherwise we would be spending most weekends at this beautiful place.  All we can say is if you didn't enjoy your stay at Villas Carrizalillo you must"

Villas Carrizalillo is to me by far the best spot to stay in this little bohemian town. Secluded on top of a gorgeous bay (Playa Carrizalillo), the view is spectacular. Have a cocktail and watch the sunset every night, and you won't get bored of it, it is different every time. What I really enjoy about It's location, aside from the above mentioned, is that it is slightly remote from the hustle and bustle of the town and Playa Zicatel which is the Surfer's beach. There you can Sky dive with the best, mingle with all sorts of people (mostly Europeans), have a go at one of the many beach front restaurants. Back to villas Carrizalillo: I went there for"
50,"i completely agree with all the previous commentaries. The hotel location is just perfect, sitting on the top of a cliff overlooking a fabulous little bay. The stairs to go down to the beach are absolutely not a problem and are even adding to the charm of the hotel. We were staying in Villa Mitla and had a great stay, rooms are cleaned every day and Gaby the woman working at the front desk was really helpfull each time we had a request. The Hotel is not located in the center of PE, however a short cab ride will take you to zicatela.  The beach down the hotel is great, and there was absolutely nobody out while we were there  in November. Absolutely stunning.  The restaurant, which is not part of the hotel, is great for breakfast and lunch. We were a little bit disapointed by the"
40,"I concur with other reviews - if you are looking for beautiful and relaxing then Villas Carrizalillo should definitely be your choice. If you want parties and noise and craziness, it's not the place. We checked out a few other options in PE and there is definitely nothing else like it there.  The staff are very kind, personable and accomodating. The service level is very high. We ended up changing villas due to some quirks in the first place we had chosen and it was no problem whatsoever. (I highly recommend La Terazza villa with a HUGE terrace overlooking the ocean, beautiful views and two hammocks!)  Again, as others have said, the location is perfect for those who are looking for privacy and quiet, yet conveniently located because it's a short walk to restaurants and shops.  "
50,"I would just say that it was one of the most incredible travels ever and this villa-style hotel has made it perfect!! We were happy there, what a great place, we had our own villa and the beach is almost a private lagoon of happiness. I still dream about this place even a year after. PS The funny thing about a villa was that there was no door to the bathroom - and was never meant to :)"
50,"My boyfriend and I have been traveling to Puerto Escondido as often as we can for two years. We are both in love with the city. I wanted my mom to fall as in love with PE as we are, so I took her to stay at the Villas Carrizalillo. The service is perfect. Gabby, who works in the front, is friendly and helpful. The owners, Ed and Amy are on the property daily, making sure everything is perfect. Ed even has the only boat driver (Martin) in Puerto Escondido that will not try to take you for all you're worth. He took my mom and I for a sunrise boat trip for two or three hours where we saw fish, rays, and sea turtles for only $500 pesos. He even took us to his favorite spot to go snorkeling. My brother went on a trip the same length of time from playa principal for $1500 pesos.   My"
50,Stayed there for some 3 nights in february. Hotelito Swiss Oasis is pefectly located in the middle of Zicatela beach which is perfect if you're there for surfing. Only 50m from the beach. There is only 8 large rooms so it's quiet. Four of them have a loft with two beds in addition to a large kingsize bed downstairs. There's an equipped kichen where you can prepare your own food. The owners Manuela and Rene were super friendly and helpful. I would definitly recommend to stay here.
50,"We stayed 3 nights at Hotelito and it was very nice there. The owners are very helpful and knowledgeable about the area. Talk to Manuela and she will give you tips on where to eat and what to do. There is a clean citchen that you can use and a pool as well. Our room was very comfortable with a big bed and our own balcony. Everything is very clean and well maintained at the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel. It is, as its name says, a little oasis."
50,"We stayed at the Hotelito as a family in a nice room counting with a huge double bed and 2 more beds on a loft. All very clean and nicely prepared. Manuela and René, the owners, are super friendly and helpful. We felt very good wipes and this influences the way the guest are living in the Swiss Oasis, all respectful, quiet, enjoying.  I'm sure that our next stay in Puerto Escondido will be at the Hotelito Swiss Oasis again. No doubt. Many thanks to Manuela and René."
50,"We arrived at Swiss Oasis at 9 pm after a strenuous journey from Puerto Escondido.  Manuela was extremely helpful in phone calls while we were driving, and when we arrived.  They are very pet-friendly, and I am afraid we challenged their patience.  We left our pups in the room the first night when we went to find something to eat, thinking they were as exhausted as we were.  Apparently not, as they raised hell while we were gone.  Manuela had walked to to try to find us!  Nonetheless, she was very understanding and patient, and the remainder of our stay was without trouble (from us!).  Our vehicle required repair, and Manuela was extremely helpful in directing us to the appropriate people.  Very close to beach, restaurants, bars, etc.  Truly an ""oasis!"""
50,"This place rocks!    Clean, comfortable, great location and excellent service. We stayed for 2 weeks and enjoyed every minute of it. Manuela and Rene (the owners) are great people. They provided us with useful information about places to eat, places to see and overall tips of the town.   Their is a clean kitchen that is available for everyone to use. The courtyard is relaxing and not to mention the pool and jacuzzi...    I would highly recommend this place to travelers to all ages and especially surfers. There is a safe place to store equipment/extra boards and whatnot. Also the price is very fair and you can stay daily, weekly or even monthly...   Check it out!"
50,"What a beautiful hotelito in such a beautiful location! Manuela and Rene made our stay so enjoyable. We booked for 4 nights and stayed for 4 weeks. I have my next trip booked already! The perfect balance of relaxation, exploration, adventure, the ocean is just perfect. I can't recommend highly enough. If you are going to puerto Escondido you must stay at the Hotelito Swiss Oasis! "
50,"Super clean, very quiet, great location right in the heart of Playa Zicatela. Excellent service! Pool, comun.kitchen, only 8 rooms so very privat, wonderful to chill with great people! We stayed first at two other hotels in Puerto Escondido, they where far away from what you get at the Swiss Oasis! Very good value for the money! I'll come back!"
50,"Excellent experience! The hosts are incredibly nice and are always making sure you’re enjoying your stay! Truly is a wonderful hotel to relax and have a great time. We have gone 3 times, normally to spend New Year’s. Take's us about 12 hours to get there and it's always nice to be received by Manuela and her kindness. There is no other place we would stay at in Puerto Escondido. The best memory I have is trying some Papaya that Manuela offered us freshly cut from her Papaya tree! Amazing!"
50,"As a family Travelling around Mexico we found this tidy compact hotel tucked in just behind the more brandish larger hotels on the beach front. We were greeted by a lovely Swiss couple who operated the hotel and showed us the rooms. It was spotlessly clean and large enough to have some space. A mezzine floor with two single beds was great for the kids and the very king bed below was comfy. The pool was great and the communal kitchen was very clean and had every utensil we required for eating in.  While some may say beach front is a better option, this hotel is literally 50 meters from the beach and central to shops, restaurants and surfboard hire.  A great location for a long or short stay."
50,"For the last 3 winters I have spent at least 6 weeks at the Hotelito and hope to do so yearly.  Great location, extremely clean, beyond friendly, and the owners are the greatest.  They offer great tips on restaurants, markets, services, and activities.  They look after you and your stuff so you can relax and have a great time!"
50,"We spent Xmas and New Year's 2011-12 at the Villa Lilli.  Our family rented out 90% of the rooms during this time, and we are a handful, trust me.  The brother-sister owners Adelina and Luis were amazing at taking care of our every need, and the attention to detail was as good as anything I've experienced in Mexico, the US or Canada.   The staff are very experienced, and truly care about your visit.  We all eagerly anticipated the authentic Oaxacan breakfasts each day (Sopes were my fave), and the same staff then took care of keeping the property in pristine condition all day long.  The daily housekeeping is meticulous (even my hanging bathing suit was neatly folded each day), and I was continually amazed at how fast the sand from our feet and flip flops was swept up!   My"
50,"My husband and I stayed here after a month of travelling in Mexico and Hawaii for our honeymoon and Villa Lili was hands down the best place we stayed in.  From the moment we emailed Louis to book it in, the service was the best we have experienced. The hosts make you feel so welcome in these beautiful villas and you can tell that they love what they do. When we arrived our room was decorated with beautiful flowers. They gave the best advice on what to do in Puerto Escondido and were always there to help. They even helped us to cook the fish we caught.  The room we stayed in was gorgeous. It had a fantastic jacuzzi and a good view from the balcony. It even had a fountain in it!  If you are planning a trip to Mexico, you have to come to Puerto Escondido and you have to stay here!"
50,"Not only is Villa Lili super close to the best beach in PE, equipped with a nice long pool for lengths, is peaceful and serves up a wonderful breakfast, it also comes with the most accommodating and helpful hostess.  We have never come across someone so eager to help and quick to get a job done: Need flights booked? Done.  Travelling to Oaxaca?  She'll send you off with a map and recommendations of places to go.  Keen to swim with turtles?  It's arranged before you can grab your swimsuit.  And the list goes on.  If you visit Puerto Escondido, be sure to check in."
50,"Visit Villa Lilli once, and you will revisit it again in your daydreams for years to come.   After spending a few months in Mexico, I decided to spend some time at the beach before heading home.  Best decision I've ever made.  I had 10 days set aside and thought I would have plenty of time to explore the area, but other than a couple of trips into Puerto Escondido, I quickly found that the area around Villa Lilli had everything I needed.  There are a few shops, restaurants and a mini mart between Villa Lilli and the beach, making it easy to pick up supplies and grab a bite to eat without going into town.   Carrazillo beach is a swimmer's dream.  I spent my days happily alternating between reading with a cold cerveza in hand, working on my tan and swimming for hours in the gentle"
50,"Just a short walk from puerto escondido's finest swimming beach, playa carrizalillo, this little B&B is every bit as unique as its rooms. I stayed twice this year for a total of three weeks, and would certainly stay again and again. Your host is the most charming Adelina and you'll be shown to your equally charming, spacious room. I particularly recommend the nemo room with it's jacuzzi and private balcony for sunset gazing. The premises are spotless and breakfast will be just enough to draw you out from your comfortable bed and launch into a day of sun worshipping and navel gazing.  After climbing the Carrizalillo stairs to get home, the pool is there to cool you down. The Rinconda is a short step away, with a selection of restaurants and retail, including spanish and surfing"
50,"My husband and I spent time in Puerto Escondido with Villa Lili during our honeymoon and it was definitely the most relaxing and welcoming place we travelled to in Mexico. You can really tell why the Villa took some years to build, the attention to detail is amazing and every room is unique and beautiful.  Adelina is an amazing host, she really cares about her guests and their experience of her beautiful town and does everything she can to make sure all her guests are happy. The Villa is beautiful and in an excellent location, all the staff are very friendly, the rooms are exceptionally clean and the breakfasts are delicious!  The personal details that Adelina added to our room for our honeymoon made us feel very special and she will always have a fond place in our hearts for"
50,"I do a lot of traveling. I almost always use Tripadvisor to help me choose accommodation.  Therefore, I make an effort to write reviews when I have stayed in exceptionally bad or exceptionally good places. Villa Lilli  highly deserves to be among the latter category. Here's why: 1. Adlina- She is the owner. She gets to know her guests personally and does everything she can to help them have a memorable experience(she gets an A+ for customer service). 2. Breakfast-It's delicious.There's something different every day and it's always accompanied with fruit, yogurt and freshly made juices. 3. Location- It's near everything. I'd been to Puerto many times before and stayed in different locations. Villa Lili is an easy walk to stores, Carrizillo beach and a 30 peso (10 cent) taxi ride"
50,"Villa Lili is a fabulous place. We stayed here for 3 days in August of this year and we loved it. Adelina, who runs the place, is friendly, flexible, helpful... and just generally a really nice person. She makes you feel at home. (PS. We arrived one day earlier than planned, and while it gave her some stress I think, she was very flexible and it was no big deal) All the Mexican ladies who work there are some of the friendliest that we have met during our 4 week trip. Breakfast is heaven; served on the patio outside, the best we've eaten in Mexico, and prepared with a smile every morning by the friendly cook. What a way to start the day, really. Playa Carrizalillo is close by and is just perfect. Safe for the kids to swim, good surfing for beginners. We recommend Villa Lili"
50,"This was our second trip to Puerto Escondido. Last year we stayed the sister property of Villa Lili, the Quinta Lili, so our expectations were pretty high.  Villa Lila is equally, if not more, wonderful! The owner and manager of the property, Adelina, is incredibly hospitable, helpful and friendly. She will go out of her way to do whatever it takes to make your stay at her hotel exceed your expectations. She is very helpful in arranging activities, like boating or fishing excursions, swimming at the nearby lagoon and more. She is very knowledgeable about the city and suggested a number of great restaurants, which we loved!  The property was decorated beautifully with flowers everywhere, detailed tile work, and tranquil lighting. Further, it is meticulously maintained. The staff"
50,"Divine.  Each room at Villa Lilli is beautifully and uniquely designed. I am constantly amazed at the attention to detail that has gone into this urban oasis. The rooms are big and open with lots of windows that allow for a ton of natural light and cool breezes.   From each balcony you can feast your eyes to decadent views of horizon, of the ocean, the sunrise, and of the mystical sunset that inspires within us the metaphorical palette in every sense of the word.    Villa is without question a hidden gem.  Villa Lili is owned and operated by a brother-sister team comprised of Luis and Adelina.  Adelina.  Adelina operates the Villa with fantastic group of ladies that will pamper you with the attention of beloved mothers that transgress any possible language barriers.  You leave"
40,"We stayed in one of the luxury beachfront condos May 2017 - it was beautifully furnished and equipped. They are building the clubhouse through December 2017, and the construction noise was bothersome if you were at the restaurant or at the pool. We preferred lounging at the beach anyways! It's not a beach for swimming but really fantastic views and endless shores for walking. Food was quite good for a resort and the staff were friendly and attentive. Overall, a fantastic value for the price. My one complaint was that they were unable to give us a late checkout, despite the fact that no one was arriving after us, and without an air conditioned place to wait, we baked in the heat. We'll return certainly next year when the construction is over and the gym is installed."
50,"After going to Vivo Resort three times in four years I've stayed in a one bedroom condo, four bedroom beachfront condo with the palapa and best of all was the private villa. Yes maybe little more money but the villa has more options meaning if you want to have peace & quite and privacy you definitely have it at the villa. If you want to jump in the pool at midnight no problem also you don't have to run for a long chair. Had enough sun you can walk up to the palapa in the shade and feel the nice breeze of the ocean. And if you want to mingle with the our guest you can still go to Happy hour at the pool bar! you have the option to dine in at your villa, at the resort or go to Puerto Escondido (15 to 20 mins drive ) and dine in one of the many restaurants. I loved it so much I"
40,"These are condos in a very nice resort. Everything is very clean and the service was great. The private beach is definitely a huge plus. I would have rated the place  (despite the construction noise) as excellent if it wasnt for 2 things. 1) there is no lobby area indoors where one can sit comfortably nor a common restroom area 2) if one does not rent a car getting around can be a challenge. The shuttle from what understood goes into town 3 times per day and a cab is 300 pesos each way. Overall the location its self is very secluded with a beautiful landscape.  If one wants to disconnect and simply relax and enjoy the surroundings,  this is the place"
50,"Amazing people, excellent resort. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful!  The rooms were very clean and maintained. The air conditioners worked well, although the cross breeze from the ocean cooled our rooms till evening. The resort was well cared for and beautiful. We had a wonderful, relaxing time. "
50,"Excellent resort in all aspects _ Accommodation, food, service, beaches, whale-watching, deep sea fishing, etc. The weather here is predictable and constantly warm and sunny. This resort is very clean and green. Ocean waves give constant soothing rhythmic sound that is very relaxing. "
50,"Vivo was amazing!!  Located in Puerto Escondido which is a hidden gem with authentic Mexican culture and amazing surfing.  Vivo itself was clean, safe, and had amazing staff.  The fully furnished condos allow you to stay with a large family or group, cook your own meals, or visit the restaurant or get room service for healthy and delicious food. And of course, happy hour at the pool bar!  Drinking water from the tap and air conditioning is a plus too.  Will definitely visit again!"
40,"Great place to kick back, relax, tan, walk the miles of unspoiled beach, swim in the pools and ocean and enjoy the sound of the waves crashing on shore. Locals and guests/owners at resort are friendly, too. Weather is great."
50,"We had booked 3 nights at a hotel about 15 minutes away.  On arrival at the other property, I discovered that I had booked it for the previous month; and they were sold out.  We found a modest hotel in PE for the night and contemplated our options.  Honestly, the trip was ruined.  Every other hotel we researched just didn't live up to what we wanted; we had our hopes set on staying on a remote beach where you could walk from your room onto the sand.  Fortunately, we came across Vivo Resorts and liked what we saw online; so we drove out to the resort with hesitant expectations.  Wow; not only did we stay for the 2 nights we had allocated for PE, we ended up staying another 4 nights and canceling the rest of our plans.  We simply couldn't leave this place.  Our unit was on the top"
50,Excellent accommodation & Service. Food & Water was excellent. Enjoyed all the tours. Security was excellent. Beach was clean & well maintained. Enjoyed the Releases of the baby turtles. Highly recommended!
50,"During a 5 day trip to Puerto Escondido I stayed a Vivo Resort. I thought the location, the condos, service and overall experience were at the top. The staff from management, through restaurant and bar, guides and service we all friendly and helpful. They do their jobs with pride and dedication. The beach is beautiful - be sure to be on it for sunrise and sunset!  During my stay all the guest at the resort had the opportunity to help release baby sea turtles into ocean in front of the resort. Definitely a moment to never forget. Vivo Foundation is the major supporter of the Palmarito Turtle Camp where baby turtles are hatched and released into the sea."
50,"We just got back from 9 days at Quinta Lili and really enjoyed the experience.  Adelina and Luis were great and went out of their way to make us feel welcome.    We also visited their other property Villa Lili, we didn't see the rooms, but in our opinion, the property was slightly more favourable as there was much more outdoor space and a larger pool than at the Quinta.   We had the master suite at the Quinta which as spacious and comfortable.  If I wanted to be really fussy, I must point out that there is no air conditioning in the property (which most of the time was not a problem as there was a nice breeze in the evenings.  Also we found the room to be very bright as there were not blinds/curtains on all of the windows which might be difficult if like us, you like to sleep in"
50,"Once again, Adelina and Luis provided the best for us on our 9 day stay in Puerto. Quinta Lili and Villa Lili attract people from all over the world, it is just always a memorable experience. We thought our first trip to PE could not be topped...Our second was even better!  Thank you Adelina, Luis, and Magdalena!    Michael and Bonnie"
50,"We spent 3 nights at Quinta Lilly with our two kids (8 and 10). Based on other reviews our expectations were high. We were not disappointed to say the least. The house and rooms are nice, Angelina provided us with extremely detailed and useful advice regarding things to do at or around puerto Escondido. And those breakfasts. They were just magnificent.   Many thanks for making us feel so welcome. If you look for a home at puerto Escondido this is the place.   "
50,"Stayed for 11 nights in early November. Was amazing to say the least. Adelina is probably the best host I have ever had and I stayed at many places around the world on my travels. Property was very clean , everything was just as stated and breakfast was amazing changing every day I was there fresh from the market. Never had the same breakfast once! Also arranged many trips for me and shared local knowledge not trying to sell me into bad tourist prices. Would highly recommend to everyone and will be back straight away if in mexico again. Thanks Adam"
50,"My husband and I are on our honeymoon and spent 6 nights in Puerto Escondido.  We came from Oaxaca City (10 days) and are now in Huatulco for 3 days.  Quinta Lili is an absolute gem.  While 2 of our 3 hotels were great, Quinta Lili is the best hotel/B&B we've ever stayed in...anywhere.  The staff (Adelina & Magdalena) are incredibly kind, friendly, and helpful.  Breakfast is delicious and I can't describe how wonderful it is to come back to the hotel and jump in the cool waters of the pool.  They even had soft tranquil music playing outside so when you walk in it is a peaceful experience.  The beach (Playa Carrizalillo) is a 5 minute walk and less crowded (at certain times of the day) than others.  Beautiful and perfect for swimming and learning to surf (we watched others,"
50,"I stayed at Quinta Lili in June 2010.  Although it has taken a long time to write this review, looking at recent reviews it seems that the standards have not changed.  Quinta Lili is such an outstanding place to stay that 2 years on, it seems like yesterday.  The most outstanding part about it was definitely the friendliness of Adelina and her willingness to go out her way to understand the individual needs of each guest and to then assist them make the most of their stay in Puerto Escondido.  Sitting outside each morning in the outdoor kitchen / dining area to have an authentic Mexican breakfast  was a perfect way to start each day.  The rooms and general design and decor are beautiful as is the pool.  My only dissatisfaction was the location - but this was personal and for"
50,"Stayed here 2 nights on trip to Mexico. The hotel is located in a neighborhood.  It's quiet and if you have a room on the upper floors you get a nice view.  The hostess is very nice and helpful but not overbearing.  Had a great Mexican breakfast. Nice pool and community area.  If you don't mind not being right on the water this is a nice place to stay.  The beach is 5 min walk.  They do have wifi, it's a bit slow, other than that A+. "
50,"A few things about Qunita Lili are worth mentioning: the lovely lap pool, the delicious traditional Mexican breakfast and the great value room with views to the sea. What really makes the stay here excellent though is Adelina, the fabulously friendly and super helpful hostess. Not only did she make us feel incredibly welcome but she went out of her way to help us in a number of ways, organising a dolphin viewing trip, our onward travel and even delivering us to the airport to catch our early morning flights. The hotel is in a quieter part of town but we liked this aspect - a selection of decent restaurants and a cove with a great swimming beach are a very short walk away. Taxis into the main part of town are easy to come by and inexpensive for when you want a more lively"
50,"This hotel was lovely and the people who run it were the best! My fiance and I stayed there for a week and can't wait for a return trip. It was close to the beaches, breakfast was always delicious and they make sure that have some thing available for people with diet restrictions like I have. The rooms were large and comfortable, the pool was beautiful and perfect after a hot walk. All the other guests were great. All in all a very friendly peaceful place!"
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Quinta Lili for 12 nights in October, and had the most incredible stay!! Adi and Magda were the most increadible hosts. We spent some time with Adi and she is the most warm, lovely, welcoming lady, who made our stay at Quinta Lili and Puerto Escondido truly amazing!! Each day Adi and Magda made us the most delicious breakfast, we had fruit, yoghurt, ceral and a different traditional Mexican dish, that was to die for!! It was a highlight of everyday. Quinta Lili is located next to one of the only swimming beaches In Puerto Escondido, and is a 2 min walk from your front door. Quinta Lili was so very clean, the bed was the best, we had cable and wifi, the sunsets from our room were incredible, and we couldn't speak more highly of Quinta Lili. If I were"
50,"Look at the pictures again.  What you see is what you get.  It really is that beautiful.  In 8 years of our group staying at Casamar, we have not been disappointed. I have checked many other places. There is none that compares for the value of what you receive at Casamar.  Each year Casamar quickly becomes our home...  Home because of the beautiful personal oasis that is awaiting each day we return from the beach or touring...  Home because of the way each member of the staff takes care of us. We generally stay for a month and when we leave, each member of our group has a special place in their hearts for Casamar... our new ""home"" in Mexico.    At the sake of repeating reviews below, I must concur with all the great things we love about Casamar.  It's away from the hustle of"
50,"Casamar  has a lush beautiful court yard with sparkling clean swimming pool surrounded by palm covered palapas where the staff catered our dinner and breakfast. I loved our tile shower !! plenty of hot water and good pressure.The owner/manager lives on the property and is available even when you forget your key at midnight. 5 gallon Bottled  water dispenser in every room .We had a large group and they let us use their bigger kitchen with all the pans and dishes .We also had dishes in our suites kitchenette.

40,"Of the few times I have gone on vacation to Puerto Escondido, CasaMar has ofered me the best place to stay because of the great service from all of the staff, the secure and nice place they keep, and because of the location of the hotel. Really enjoided my staing and I hope to come back soon."
40,"We were only in Puerto Escondido two nights but the manager of the reception was very friendly and went out of his way to help out.  As some of the other travelers have said, it is a great place for the price.  The room was nice and the pool was clean.  I would have given the hotel a 5-star, but I couldn't because the neighborhood was really loud in the mornings.  We were there on a holiday weekend in Mexico, so that may have been part of it, but the neighbors (very loud) music started at 6 am both mornings.  There were also a lot of other early noises such as a construction guy working outside my window.  It might have all been bad luck and the location of our room on the first floor.  There was a good breakfast/crepe place within walking distance and the beach is also within"
50,"We stayed at casamar suites in August for a week. It's an amazing spot run by wonderful people and attracts lovely travelers. We had our own private suite which was beautifully decorated and close to the pool. We used the body boards, rented surf boards, found a great surf instructor, did free yoga and met lots of lovely people. Our room was cleaned daily and kept immaculate.  Even better, casamar is really well priced for all that goodness. To me, this place is an absolute must!  Thanks to Will, the owner, for going out of your way to help us with anything and everything. "
50,"Will is the GUY!!! Very good host! Will get everything you need! Very good apartments, pool, barbcue place... Calm and quiet at night. They even have free yoga classes, parties with free drinks at sunset time Just ask about AC extra fares before renting an apartment. A Guest House with Hotel service!"
50,"It is always a joy to stay at Casamar.  Beautiful pool and grounds, clean spacious rooms, friendly staff, great yoga and aerobics classes.  Walking distance to La Punta and Zicatella for surfing or dining.  The Tuesday ""meet and greet"" let you get to know the other guests and a few locals. As guests come from all over, Casamar offers a good opportunity to make life long friends from around the world.   I own a home in Puerto and when in town, I prefer to stay at Casamar!!"
50,"I am writing with some feedback about Casamar Suites, a special boutique hotel located in “La Punta” Puerto Escondido, Mexico. At Casamar, one can enjoy peaceful accommodation while being close to downtown Puerto Escondido.      During a recent two month, solo vacation to Puerto Escondido this spring, I stayed at five different hotels. Having returned to Puerto Escondido for a second visit this year, Casamar Suites was easily the place and location that I chose to make home.  The list of reasons is extensive. Here are just a few:   Price:  •	Easily the very best mid range hotel in all of Puerto Escondido.  •	Seasonal as well as generous discounts to returning guests. (this was a nice surprise!)  Location:  •	A peaceful and very secure setting close to the charming beach, shops"
40,"Located only a block away from the beach, Casamar truly reflects its name. Only couple of blocks away from La Punta (the most consistent surfing spot on Zicatela) - Casamar is a hidden pearl for surfers. Not only is the hotel clean, safe and has great atmosphere - the kind and knowledgable personel, make a difference!! The manager is very friendly and helpful, and every morning kitchen lady slice fresh fruit and brews you coffee. Rooms are very roomy, come with fully equiped kitchen and our room had a beautiful bathroom.   To understand the location, you should know that Puerto Escondido is spread out in 3 areas: main Zicatela strip, center and La Punta. Casamar is located in La Punta, only a short 30pesos tax ride from main Zicatela strip and center - both are also reachable by"
50,"After a hot day at the beach or a sticky walk in the little community of Zicatela or elsewhere, Casamar is a paradise to return to. It's also great just to spend the whole day there. The gardens are lovely, the pool refreshing, the owner (Willits was there when my son and I stayed there) friendly and very knowledgeable about the area. The entire staff, especially Ullises, couldn't be more helpful. Casamar is set in a real neighborhood away from the tourist hotels and shops, with a local restaurant right next door and a pricier one with all-around great food within walking distance. The rooms are spectacular. Ours had a huge balcony and was airy and open, with a full kitchen. The decor, including beautiful Talavera tiles, is lovely. This is a wonderful find."
50,"If you are looking for a beautiful destination-then Puerto Escondido is your place. If you are looking for accommodations that are intimate, relaxing and tropical-then Villas Carrizalillo should definitely  be your choice.  We stayed in Villas Colorada, and it was everything the website and photo stated it would be. The staff are incredibly kind and accommodating. You are always greeted with a warm smile and a  pleasant manner.  I would consider this  property a hidden gem because it is very private,  yet some conveniences and eateries are  easily within walking distance. The property overlooks a gorgeous bay surrounded by lush foliage. The grounds of the property are kept impeccable.The beach below(Playa Carrizalillo) is stunning, not crowded and  quite swimmable.  You do have"
50,"We had our daughter's wedding at Villas Carizzalilo after only viewing it on line and admiittedly spending alot of time on the phone and internet with Amy Hardy. the resort manager. Our expectations were exceeded on every score. The villas are great, the setting most amazing. Amy was an incedible resource and her calm and confident presence was very much appreciated. She had great ideas -- fireworks from the beach, good references for photographers, and music, and she was quietly there whenever you needed her.  The rooms were great, the hospitality exceptional, and honestly, if you can't be happy at the Villas, you may never be...  Los Tugas, the restaurant on the premises, is incredible and what they did for the wedding, even more so....amazing hor d'ouevres, great Caca and"
50,"Spent three glorious nights at the VC and feel it well deserves the good reviews it has received.  We stayed in the Villa Mitla - amazing views, strongly recommended for a romantic break.   If you are looking for a relaxing place to stay I doubt if you'll be disappointed."
50,"We stayed at Villas Carizzalillo for a one night stay during a trip on the oaxacan coast.  We had stayed at other puerto escondido hotels before, but this one is definitely one notch above all the others.  We stayed in the ''Escondido'' suite, which boasts an amazing view of the Carrizzalillo bay.  We enjoyed walking down a few stairs to have a morning surf session.  Food was excellent at their restaurant and pricing was decent . Very recommended."
50,"I am really late in writing a review, but just wanted to comment on how wonderful my stay was at VC.  One of the cleanest, largest rooms I have ever stayed in. Hotel is perfectly located. Unlimited fresh bottled water in the rooms. Daily cleaning service that do an incredibly thorough job. Beautiful grounds. We found no bugs whatsoever.... except when we left the hotel. We stayed in the Escondido suite and even though it was one of the cheaper rooms, it was wonderful. The view was amazing. I have stayed in upscale chains, all-inclusives, B&Bs in many places and this hotel is one of my favourites.   The hotel is within about 10-15 minutes walking distance of the other beaches, some shops and  restaurants, but to get to Zicatela and the Point take a cab. Cabs almost anywhere were"
50,My partner and I just came back from Villas Carrizalillo and we loved it. The hotel is impecable and just beautiful! our room looked exactly like it did on the owner's website (which is rarely the case). The owners were very sweet and hospitable. They helped us book flights from Oaxaca city and even gave us cash when we ran out of pesos so that we wouldn't have to inmediately go to an ATM (of course we happily paid them later) We highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a romantic quite place with amazing views in Puerto Escondido...  The only thing we were not impressed by was the restaurant in the hotel  which is not owned by the hotel owners...  still had the best sunset views during happy hour.
50,"We had always heard wonderful stories about the beauty, tranquility, amazing surf and uniqueness of Puerto Escondido, but the hospitable nature of the owners/ staff of Villas Carrizalillo made our trip a memory of a lifetime. Our family, recently complete with the addition of our 7 mo old daughter, made the trip down to Puerto along with several friends to explore a new destination and fact check all of the wondrous reports of this amazing coastline.  Upon our arrival, we were greeted by name with the genuine touch and friendly smile of owner, Amy, welcoming us into her paradise.  The property was breathtaking with the natural surroundings that included a wide array of flora and fauna that immediately set scene.  I was unable to show attentiveness to the friendly staff that was"
50,Great place to get away from it all.  You must stay at the Villas Carrizalillo--www.villascarrizalillo.com.  My wife and I got married and had our honeymoon there.  We had a blissful time.  Puerto Escondido is a small fishing village that has become a minor surfing mecca.  The food is great and the atmosphere is laid back and authentically Mexican.  Not a tourist trap like many coastal resort towns.
50,"When we first set foot at the Villas Carrizalillo we felt at home.  The place is gorgeous, overlooking the Carrizalillo bay, with palm trees everywhere giving it a fresh and cool oasis like feeling. It is extremely comfortable, clean and of good taste and it blends well with the nature around it. We experienced the most beautiful sunset right there in our varanda. And it has a private stairway to the magical little beach bellow.  Service was excellent. The lady at the front desk was very sweet and eager to help each time and so did the lady that came to clean our room. Everyone was helpful and yet very laid back. Oh, and they have a lovely restaurant, Portuguese food. We had a delicious curry if you can believe it and the view, of course, is stunning. I recommend having a"
50,"Last month my husband and I had the opportunity to stay at Villas Carrizalillo as part of our second visit to the state of Oaxaca.  We spent most of our time in the city of Oaxaca, but those three days and two nights at the Villas were wonderful.  Amy and Ed were gracious hosts, and Mario and Elizabeth who run the upstairs restaurant were similarly accommodating and hands-on.  Everything about the resort was as represented on the website.  We were with another couple so we stayed in one of the two bedroom suites.  It was spacious and immaculate.  Whenever I had a chance to peak into another unit during housekeeping hours I did so, and found them equally impressive … from the doorway of course.  The pool is kept in pristine condition and is a welcome change from the beach when"
50,"We really enjoyed our stay in Villa Lili. The room was clean and nicely decorated. Our host Adelina was really nice - she recommended us nice restaurants in the downtime, she picked us up to the airport, ... She helped us whenever and for whatever we needed her. We should not forget to mention that the breakfast was extremely delicious and the ladies in the kitchen were really really kind. We recommend Villa Lili to anyone who is going to spend some days in Puerto Escondido!"
50,Adelina and her ladies make you feel so comfortable.  My daughters ages 15 and 12 will stay no place else.  (They are already having me promise to take them next year.)  They always feel like they are returning home to family.  So much care and love! Also the Oasis Surf and Spanish School is high recommended by us.  For an authentic Mexican vacation visit Puerto Escondido and stay at Villa Lili.
50,"My children and I and several friends recently stayed at Villa Lili.  We found it to be a wonderful B&B.  The rooms were clean and large, the staff incredibly friendly, the breakfasts terrific with lots of delicious food, and the location wonderful for walking to Playa Carizillo. The owner, Adelina, is incredibly helpful and speaks English as well as Spanish.  She treated us a ""friends of the family"".  Villa Lili is truly a gem!"
50,"great pool, nice outdoor kitchen, lovely service team and really good advice for tripps in the area."
50,"This hotel is fantastic! We have never before or after experienced a hotel where the hotelowner and staff is so friendly and helpful. The owner drove us to the busstation as well as to the farmacy. She also speeks excellent english, which is nice when you don't speek spanish.  The rooms are nice and clean and the poolarea is beautiful and cosy. The whole atmosphere there is just so nice and relaxed. We only stayed at this hotel for one night, as we had to move on, but we would have loved to stay there forever!  We highly recomend this hotel to everyone!"
50,"I stay 2 weeks to work for a photography exhibit about Mexico and I fell in love with.. . Villa Lili is like a romantic oasis in Puerto , like the orchids of Ade , rare and beautiffull .  I 'm from Tahiti and I know paradise but here it's something special on the planet of Mexico . You will love villa Lili and if you are nice guest Ade will drive you to some secret places around Puerto to see wildlife : turtle , birds, crocodiles.... I teached her few things about photography and know Ade is a very good , ask her to show you her photos of birds from the laguna. I'm writing that from Bondi beach in Sydney , it's cold , rainy and windy and I dream about Puerto , Villa Limi and Ade"
50,"My partner and I stayed at Villa Lili in February 2011. We stayed in the top upstairs room which was beautiful; spacious, clean and with a view of the sun setting every night was amazing. We were confused when booking thinking that we were staying at the sister villa- Quinta Lili... no one had told us that we had been moved to the Villa Lili and so were regularly confused when trying to get a cab home!  Regardless of this we had a brilliant stay. Adelina is an amazing host who sat down with us upon check in and showed us the local ""hot spots""- definitely take on her recommendations. Villa Lili is close to a great little surf beach and a short walk to town. If you are around during the phosfleurence season in the lagoon - definitely do the tour with Ebbie- amazing experience.  "
50,This was the most beautiful place we stayed in Mexico! Adelina and her orchards make you feel so welcome and all the friendly staff. Thank you for making our stay so peaceful and a place to remember.
50,"This is an exceptional experience that I will definitely repeat as soon as possible! These guys run at world class Bed & Breakfast and offer superb hospitality over and above the ordinary. The casa itself is exquisite and Luis has put his incredible imagination to work with the design. The rooms, the pool, the breakfast area are superb! Speaking breakfast, make sure you try the fish taco and the divorced eggs both delicious! The rooms are perfectly equipped and the staff are warm friendly and extremely obliging.  Nothing is too much trouble, in fact it feels like younare staying with family or old friends. We will absolutely be making another trip to Puerto Escondido to stay here again...it is divine! Thanks guys..we loved every minute and did not want to leave"
50,"The house and rooms are well kept. Most staff speak only Spanish but that makes for a real Mexican experience. The breakfast service is excellent. They will serve most anytime before noon. The premises are real quiet so this is not a place to come if you intend to party with loud music or other noise. I would go back again for sure. The location is fine for walking to restaurants and the beach, although the stairs up and down to the Carisolilla beach are long and steep."
40,It was one of my favourite place along Mexico. Nice people and confortable room.
50,"Everything was really really fine. And the owners are really friendly, helpfull and multilingual. A beautiful place to stay"
50,"We stayed at Swiss Oasis for two weeks recently and loved every aspect of it; the location is fantastic (close to beaches and many, many restaurants); the rooms are immaculately clean and spacious; the pool and other amenities are spot-on and the hosts are fantastic and ensure you feel like you are staying in their home. Couldn't recommend it highly enough. We can't wait to go back!"
50,"After u arrive in Puerto Escondido, a taxi takes u quickly to the Hotelito. We found them online and one call was enough to reserve a room. After arrival we were very pleased to find it. We had a great time and love their cats! Of course the Landlords where most kind and helpful. They speak Spanish, German, French and of course English! Don't miss it!"
50,"A sweet little hotel in Playa Zicatela, in the alley near Mangos Restaurant. we found it after searching all the hotels along the Playa, and is certainly the most beautiful, clean, pleasant and welcoming of them all. Thanks to Manuel and Renee, the owners, and their lovely cats and dog"
50,Stayed here for a week or so and loved every minute of it.  The owners Manuela and Rene are very nice people and are there to accommodate you in any way possible.  The rooms are very clean and tidy with very comfortable beds. The swimming pool is really clean and great for relaxing by. I will definitely be staying here again in the future. Thanks for the great stay Manuela and Rene!
50,"Previous reviewers have done an accurate and excellent job of describing the Swiss Oasis.  Yes, it is all true!    My husband and I have vacationed annually in Puerto for the past 7 yrs.  We rent an apt in another area of town for a month.   This year we wanted to add a few more days to our visit (apt was unavailable)  so we decided to stay in the Zicatela area.  We spent 3 nts at the Swiss Oasis;  great quiet location, relaxing, well-kept and CLEAN.  The Swiss Oasis truly is Mexican charm meets Swiss efficiency."
50,"near Beach (3 Minute walk), quiet, only 9 rooms, pool cool to relax, very clean, enough space for clothes to hang and other stuff, own bathroom with hot water, very friendly and helpful hosts, good tours (laguna, dolphin watching, turtle release, riding to hot springs etc., small kitchen to cook own food (fresh fish and food can be bought at the market), cool drinks and refidgerator,  good prizes, rooms only with fan (windows have just moskito nets-so there is always a breeze, safe, close to restaurants, shops etc., micros and taxis to go into town always available"
50,"We stayed here for 10 days and wish we could have stayed longer.  The owners Manuela and Rene are super-friendly, relaxed and welcoming.    The location is perfect if you want to be close to Playa Zicatela and Playa Marina as well as a big range of shopping, eating, drinking places, yoga etc.   Manuela will give you a map and help with whatever questions you have about the area.     We stayed at the beginning of the hot, humid season and found our room to be very comfortable.  It was on the upper level, with a king-size bed, 2 fans, large sliding door (good for breezes), big bathroom and private patio all under the palapa roof which stays cool and lets the breeze come and go.  The rooms are cleaned thoroughly every day.  Sheets and towels changed every 3 days.  Extra towels for"
50,"We went there with our little daugher of 2 1/2 years,  stayed for around 6 or 7 nights and had the most wonderful time. Location is perfect, near nice restaurants and the Zicatela beach. There is also a kitchen for the guests, that was very practical to use. Definitely the place to stay if you plan a laid back plan in Puerto Escondido!"
20,"I have traveled all over the world. Six continents. Over 100 countries. I’ve stayed everywhere from mud huts to hostels to five-star hotels. And never in my decades of travel have I been as disappointed as I was with Vivo Resorts in Puerto Escondido. “Hoodwinked” might be the best word to describe my experience there. First off, Vivo is not a “resort"" per se, but a group of four condo buildings roughly 25 minutes from Puerto Escondido. To simply get out to the main road into town you have to spend 10-15 minutes driving down a dirt road, inhaling dust and diesel fumes. The “resort” has the aura of luxury, but if you just scratch below the surface, you will find a profound lack of quality in many areas.  The rooms are large, but poorly designed. Our TV was hung on a wall that"
50,This resort is fantastic ! Staff is helpful and friendly. The unit we has is beautiful . Everything and the property is so clean. The pool is awesome . The beach is gorgeous . People i saw and someone I traveled with got taken under so be careful ! I didn't try swimming. The restaurant on the property is great. We checked out zicatela  beach (people I traveled with tried surfing and said they loved it and the instructor was nice and helpful) others . All nice . We shopped at chedraui and it had everything we wanted. We did have a minor issue with the fridge but the staff attended to it . We have seen dolphins and whales in the distance from the beach. Three people that came with us went fishing through Omar's sport fishing and said they had a blast. Saw pictures they took and
50,"We spent our family vacation at Vivo Resorts in Puerto Escondido from November 26 to December 6, 2016. The resort is beautiful, luxurious, the spacious 4th floor premium beachfront 3 bedroom 2 bath suite has a magnificent unobstructed ocean view, extra-large balcony facing the pool and the ocean. It has luxurious furniture, modern, fully equipped kitchen, laundry and is impeccable clean. The staff is very friendly and professional, the meals freshly prepared and delicious. Vivo Resorts offered us the best vacation ever, thank you VIVO. We’ll be visiting again in 2017."
50,"Zacatella Beach, Angelito Beach, Downtown Puerto Escondido, Carrizilillo Beach, La Punta Beaches are all a must experience and enjoy.  Fresh is a great place to eat on Zacatella Beach,  Pascale's is another great restaurant on the Playa Principles Beach-------There are so many terrific places to eat in town and on the beaches. "
50,"Vivo Resorts is clean, friendly and amazing.  The staff is absolutely incredible and they try very hard to help make your experience a great one.  They are working hard on their English and in turn help you with your Spanish.The only tip I can suggest is bring bug spray with deet.  Those pesky mosquito's enjoy nibbling."
40,"I did post another review on TripAdvisor...just can't figure out how to edit that review.  All in all, good (really good actually)...except for the bug bites.  I guess it's common for this region.  If I could make any suggestion to Vivo...stock benadryl and 'Afterbite' in your little store to treat the bug bites received on the beach.  For those who react to bug bites....make sure to bring something to treat the inflammation and itch.  Apart from that...yeah...it's a solid 30 minutes into PE...but big deal.  It's not an all-inclusive, so you have to pay to go off-site for golf, other beaches, ect...Share the cost of the shuttle, and it's not that bad.  Hmmm...what else....the trim of all the rooms is crazy good, and...you can flush your TP!!!!  Air conditioning works so good I'm"
50,"Awesome trip, so relaxing. The empty beach goes on forever with no one bugging you to buy anything. It's the only time I've been to Mexico without getting sick, thanks to their filtered water. The rooms are first class with all the luxuries of home including North American TV, so we got to watch all of our programs and sports and in English. Going back Again !"
50,"I feel very lucky to have been a repeat guest at Vivo as it has certainly been a place where we can relax and enjoy.  Congratulations on receiving the award of excellence for 2016, so well  deserved as they go above and beyond in service and quality.  We celebrated  my partners 60th birthday while there and one of our kids came as a surprise, she later told us she can now see why we love it so much.  The staff go out of their way to see that the guests are happy.  We will definitely return.  Thanks Vivo for another great vacation.  "
50,My girlfriend and I came back to Puerto Escondido after a long time a go neither of us have been there. Our expectation was to found a place like the others in Puerto very simple with no fancy stuff. When we start our way to the hotel our driver was a little bit pessimistic because certainly the resort its far from the regular beaches were all of the tourism goes. Our surprise started when we arrived to the place. Facilities did exceed our expectations a lot. First the very warm welcome we had with fresh towels and a free sangría. Then we got our room villa before. The rooms are amazing full equiped to stay there for months literally. That is the only thing I would appreciate to know because we could arrive more prepared. We had a full explanation of the facilities and
50,"Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by the hotel staff and loading up our bags before we could even get out of our car. First impression was great! Headed to our two-bedroom, ocean-view condo on the bottom floor to an amazing 1500 SQ FT! It was totally gorgeous and very spacious. Everything as advertised. Amazing Ocean view, very peaceful, and quiet far away from the construction. The location itself is about 8 minutes from the Highway, going thru farm roads to the site of the resort. The resort is an ""active"" construction site, but the completed portions are beautiful. Best to get a condo facing the beach away from the construction. The staff overall was very amazing, enjoyed the turtle release and sunsets were remarkable. If your planning for a nice peaceful get-away,"
50,"I only write reviews for places that are outstanding and this place, as well as its host Adelina, was brilliant. Don't stay anywhere else in Puerto Escondido. We loved our room, had a great time relaxing by the pool and enjoyed the traditional breakfast. Thanks again Adelina! "
50,"We had the most lovely stay at quinta lili. It was by far our favourite place in Mexico. We planned to stay 3 nights and ended up staying 7. We received such wonderful care from the staff Addie and Josephina - they made us feel like family. Josephina's breakfasts were also sensational - something different everyday. We thoroughly recommend this hotel and hope to come back ourselves.  Shush and Lee (Melbourne, Australia) "
50,All was perfect during my stay at this wonderful place! I will come back! it was next to the beautiful beach called Carrizalillo ahere we took some surf lessons. The brekfasts are the best. the owner every day cooks a different tipical mexican dish.
50,Fantastic location just above the beautiful Carrizalillo Beach. Adelina and her team prepare the most delicious Mexican breakfast you ever tasted. The clean pool is refreshing in the hot and humid climate and great for kids to play. It is an intimate home away from home and doesn't really give you the feeling that you're in a hotel. You will get all the help you need to find your way around Puerto Escondido and you will also dine at the best places if you listen to Adelina. I only can recommend this location.
50,"we have been four persons (one 3 year old) for a week at quinta lili and i cannot explain how wonderful it was for all of us! perfect located next to the center and stunning beach, little pool in front of the rooms - perfect for children, always clean, friendly/not complicated team, nice big rooms...but the best i think was the original mexican breakfast which we enjoyed most at the quinta every morning! the owner, adelina, gave us so many really really good tips about surfing, restaurants, sightseeing and much more...so we could really meet the wonderful, friendly and very interesting mexican - specialy oaxacan - culture! i need to thank up here the whole quinta lili team - specially adelina and magdalena! we had a great vacation and we'll be back soon for sure!!! muchas gracias"
50,"Quinta Lili is an excellent choice for anyone travelling to Mexico, the hotel is a small family run type of place with only five rooms, each with a unique design.  You are a short walk away from Carizalillo beach which is the best swimming beach in Escondido (the waves being very large at Zicatela). The hotel is also very close to Benito Jaurez Blvd where an assortment of restaurants (we particularly liked La Torre) exist. The breakfasts served by Josephina (from 7am-12noon!!) were really tasty and different each of the 6 mornings we were there, allowing us to sample an assortment of Mexican food. The hotel really does tick all the boxes: quiet, immaculately clean, good location, lovely pool, great food but what made it extra special was the personal touch given by Adelina;"
50,"Amazing place to stay in Puerto Escondido, the best swimming beaches are a short walk away and the hosts are excellent at arranging day trips and tours! The included breakfasts were the best we had in all our travels and great restaurants are only down the road! The rooms are stunning and the whole experience is truly relaxing. Couldn't recommend it more - thanks for a great stay."
50,"That might sound a little dramatic, but this really is a lovely lovely place.  I have been to Mexico a few times in the last few years and travelled all over, but of all the places I have been, this has to be my favourite.  The house was specifically designed as a small boutique hotel, and there are only 5 rooms, but it is perfect. Carizalillo beach is  a very short walk and if you don't want to walk just look out your upstairs window at the panoramic views!  The 5 rooms all have different characteristics - size wise and view wise.   I was there slightly off season and so was in the master suite on the top floor.  9 months later I still show my friends pictures of the view of the Pacific from the numerous windows, the view of the Pacific from the hot tub, the  view of the"
50,"There is not one criticism I could give Quinta Lili - the hotel is immaculate in a beautiful location with the most friendly and helpful of hosts, Adelina and Josephina - what a great breakfast she makes too! During our 10 day stay every need was catered too perfectly - I couldn't recommend a place more!"
50,"My husband and I spent a week in the Master Suite at Quinta Lili last month, during our honeymoon and we can not recommend the place highly enough! The villa itself is gorgeous, our room -perfect (complete with rooftop spa) and the local beach is the best for swimming in the area.  We enjoyed the most amazing dolphin tour- out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, amongst a few hundred (!) dolphins frolicking in the wild. Absolutely recommend it. Adelina's knowledge of the area and her recommendations were excellent and the tour guides she sent us to, equally as good.  I had expressed interest in local cooking classes before arriving and while this isnt something generally available, Adelina happily arranged for us to go with her and Josefina over to Villa Lili, their sister"
50,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at Casamar close to la Punta in Puerto Escondido. The minute we stepped through the gates of the small, boutique hotel, we knew we had picked the right place. Our room was #9- CONGA- beautifully appointed with everything a traveler could ask for...full kitchen, (we used the bender to make smoothies with mangoes that were falling from the trees), wifi, wonderful light, ceiling fans and a huge bathroom with a great shower. The hotel is tranquil, with a luxe private pool and wonderfully landscaped property. The owner, Will was friendly and helped us to save an injured bird we found on the beach. He drove us to the vet and then onto the Laguna where it was happily released into calm waters. The staff were also fantastic- our rooms were cleaned"
50,"Casamar has excellent service, food and the place is amazing. Just few metres from Zicatella beach and minutes from the town. I spent 4 weeks in paradise :) It far exceeded my expectations and also those of other ppl attending the training course. The manager was helpful in the best way he could be and even took ppl to town.. The rooms are spotlessly cleaned everyday, free wifi, excellent food, the perfect stay at Puerto Escondido!"
50,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week. We originally had reservations for three nights and were so comfortable here that we decided to extend our stay.  The owner and the property manager made us feel at home and were always very welcoming. The hotel offers great yoga and salsa aerobics classes. This place is great for family and couples. They have a nice garden, pool and family room. All rooms have kitchens. Overall this is by far one of the best values in town."
50,"Casamar far exceeded our expectations.  The owner personally squired us around the environs of Puerto Escondido and a surrounding island, and the food and drink were magnificent.  I WILL return!"
50,"I just returned from a three-month trip to Mexico, almost a month of which I spent at Casamar in Puerto Escondido.  Despite what you might expect based on the news reports in the U.S., I never felt unsafe or threatened in any way during my time south of the border.  In fact, if I could find a job in Puerto Escondido, I would move there permanently!  Unlike vacations I’ve taken in larger Mexican resort areas like Cancun and Los Cabos, I didn’t feel separated from the local population in Puerto Escondido.  Plus, I really enjoyed the laid-back atmosphere and un-crowded beaches of this smaller fishing town turned surf mecca.  Casamar is a lush oasis located just steps from Playa Zicatela and a short taxi- or collectivo- ride from the center of town.  Tucked into a charming garden"
40,"Very comfortable accommodations and a brilliant staff.  Every question answered, every request fulfilled.  The pool was a great asset, sparkling clean and lovely tile artwork and pleasant surroundings.   Cant wait to go back."
50,"Casamar isn't in the Tourist Centre of Puerto Escondido, it is in a quiet area towards the end of the main Zicatela beach (la Punta). Given that there are taxis passing by the end of the road every 2 or 3 minutes who will run you into town for about USD2, this means you can have a nice quiet sleep and still be close to the action. Its also a safe 30 minute walk down the beach to town if you want the healthy option.  So we eventually decided that Casamar's location is an advantage - since we enjoyed the beach walks. There are also some OK local restaurants 10 minutes safe walk at La Punta, if you are willing to try local food. There is also a great upmarket beachside restaurant 5 minutes away called Guadua, which is worth a visit. Unlike many suites, Casamar has a fully equipped"
50,"We fell in love with this absolutely charming, small boutique hotel! This place definitely stands out among Puerto's places to stay. We applaud Casamar's down-to-earth, bilingual staff for making us feel welcome, arranging all of our activities, and ensuring ongoing satisfaction during our four week stay. Once you step inside Casamar, you are surrounded by exquisite Mexican hand-painted tile murals and colorful ceramic Talavera tiles. The large outdoor pool is surrounded by an immaculately manicured lawn that boasts gorgeous flowers and trees. Our fabulously decorated Oaxacan-style suite was comfortable and clean. From our balcony, we had an incredible 360 degree view of the sunset that glistened  upon the Pacific ocean and mountains. We walked down the street to Guadua--one of"
50,"I would definitely recommend Casamar to anyone staying in Puerto Escondido! The courtyard was beyond beautiful with amazing landscaping. It was filled with hummingbirds and butterflies enjoying the bursting flowers. The suite was comfortable and impeccably clean. I loved how, instead of feeling like some anonymous hotel room, it felt like I was staying in a guest house with many personalized touches that reflected the local culture. The staff were always willing to help out or just have a chat. It really isn't within walking distance to anywhere that we went, however, taxis were easy to catch on the street and the staff was always willing to call one if we asked. My vacation in Puerto was the most relaxing, enjoyable vacation I have ever taken and I attribute that to staying at"
50,"We had a great experience at Casamar. We were welcomed by Andy, one of the staff members, who welcomed us and explained the local culture, transportation, restaurants and places to visit. The hotel is very secure and incredibly clean. The grounds were well kept and very picturesque, everyday the friendly staff at Casamar were working hard on keeping the place clean. The room was very nice with a nice kitchenette, coffee pot, mid-size refrigerator, ceiling fan, plenty of electrical outlets, reliable wireless internet and very clean. We stayed in room #12 which over looks the Pacific Ocean and Zicatela beach, our balcony was grand with a nice table, umbrella and deck furniture. There was room cleaning service everyday but Sunday, they did a really nice job as well. Every morning"
50,"A group of friends and I just spent the past 7 nights at Villas Carrizalillo in Puerto Escondido and I have to say it exceeded all my expectations. I have been to Mexico and Central America numerous times and have never felt so instantly drawn to a place like this before. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel like family among the owners and staff who, over the past week we became good friends with and hope to know for a long time. The property itself is absolutly breathtaking as it sits on the cliffs of the bay overlooking a perfect beach for those who either want to surf, relax or snorkel in the clear green water. The rooms were extremely clean and nicely decorated, every night we opened the windows and fell asleep to the sound of waves. What also makes Villas"
20,"We stayed at the Villas Carrizalillo for two nights mid-September and were initially enchanted with the locale. The buildings are perched on a cliff above the Carrizalillo beach, which is excellent for beginner to intermediate surfing, and only a short (albeit steep) walk down a flight of stairs. The front desk was also helpful in securing us a surfing instructor for my husband´s daughter, and he was excellent (Hydro) particulalry when compared with the less experienced instructors you find on the beach. The problems began when my husband went to the front desk mid-day to ask a question and found no one. He then went to the restaurant/bar area to see if there was someone from the hotel staff who could help. He was greeted by the chef (who is also a co-owner, with his wife, of"
40,"I have stayed at the Villas Carrizalillo twice now in the past two years. The grounds at Villas Carrizalillo are absolutely beautiful, expecially at night when the paths are lit up. The beds are comfortable and the A/C works great. The first time I stayed in Villa Canada and had no problems/complaints. However, the second time I stayed in Villa Venecia, and experienced the same plumbing problems as another traveler mentioned.  The Villas Carrizalillo has a restaurant with a bar located in it and a small bar located underneath the restaurant. The food at the restaurant was wonderful, and the managers Scott and Sarah are a true delight. The bar below is also worth visiting. The friendly bartender Ricardo offers great conversation and a delicious night cap to end your night."
40,"My wife and I stayed at Villas Carizalillo for two nights in June 2008.  The view from most of the rooms/suites is without question the best we've seen at any beach destination in the world. The property overlooks Playa Carizalillo, which is a fantastic beach for novice surfers and pretty good for recreational swimmers, as well.  The water is quite clear.  Nearby Playa Manzanillo (within walking distance) is smaller, only slightly less picturesque, but the water is calmer for swimming.  Swimmer-friendly Playa Angelito is also within walking distance, but it is where the local fisherman and boat tour operators park their boats, so it's not such a great place to spend your day.  Villas Carizalillo is, I believe, the only place to stay on/at Playa Carizalillo.  If you are young and"
50,"We stayed at the Villas for five nights in April and found it a great place to stay. Our villa was really nice and its large terrace with the views over Carrizalillo bay was simply amazing. We loved the privacy we had - no one was overlooking us and we did not see people too often; it was a quiet and secluded place. The rooms and beds are large and comfortable; bathroom was quite small but clean. There was a kitchen with some equipment although we never really used it except for the fridge. We never had any issue with the cleanliness of the place, the only comment is that we found it a bit inconvenient that the maids cleaned the villa around 1pm, exactly when it was becoming hot and we wanted to have a siesta.   Seis Palmas has really good food and excellent service in addition"
50,"We found Villas Carrizalillo two years ago and returned this March for 14 days.  The setting is spectacular overlooking a turquois bay.  The waves were up when we were there in March and many surfers spent the day there.  This is one of the best places for sunset in Puerto Escondido and the small bar is open primarily during the sunset though the Seis Palmas restaurant is open all day.  It is a great place to meet people from all over the world.  We have stayed in the Escondido and Puebla villas, both one bedrooms that face the bay.  You cannot see any other villas from these two.  The only sound is the waves crashing on the rocks below.  Both villas were very charming and every villa is unique.  There are two new villas that we heard are spectacular.  The new swimming pool was"
20,"We had seen all the favorable reviews on Trip Advisor and were expecting a beautiful stay. We had mixed results, however, and some of the items were especially noticeable since we stayed in a fabulous B and B both in Oaxaca and Huatulco. The property is very nice with a spectacular view and a great beach.  It seems that great care has been taken with the public areas like the sunset terrace and the reading room which is actually more like a covered terrace. The gardens are also beautiful and well-cared for. The villa we stayed in (Venecia) was impractical since the door to the restroom was in plain view of the street and the office next door. We felt very uncomfortable everytime we showered.When we arrived, we immediately noticed there was no lock on the gate. We also had no hot"
50,We stayed at Villas when we visited Puerto in Aug. 2006.  At first we were not too sure about what to expect.  We stayed in the Terraza Villa overlooking the small bay.    We were a short walk away from the beach everyday.  The terrace view was specatacular in the evenings.  The room was a nice size and included a small kitchen but we spent most of our time on hammocks on the Terrace.  The owners were extremely nice and very helpful.   I understand that Villas Carrizalillo has just gone thru some renovations now too.  A pool and restaurant is now available w/ bar.  Its a private location in a secluded nook so my wife and I feel in love with place.  We will definitely be back to Puerto Escondido soon and this will be the place we will be staying at from now on.  For the
50,"We stayed at Carrizalillo for 4 nights and could have stayed for weeks longer. This is the definitely the kind of place that people keep coming back to, and for good reason. Located right above an idyllic beach in a secluded cove, this is the perfect spot for a non-package beach vacation. Both tourists and locals enjoy this beach for its calm waters. As for the resort itself, the staff, the views, the on-site restaurant, and all the other amenities make it an overall lovely place."
50,Villas Carrizalillo is by far the best in Oaxaca.  The views were fabulous and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  The beach is one of the best in the country.  I don't think there is such a better hotel than that of Villas Carrizalillo!
50,This hotel is wonderful.  You can tell that the owners are travelers themselves as they know what people need.    The location: It is more than 50 meters set back from the main street of Zicatela.  I was worried about having access to beaches we could swim in but the location is maybe a 5 minute walk to the more protected area.  In addition the surf was not very high while we were there so we could swim right in front of the hotel area.  Because the hotel is set back there is minimal noise from the bars on the beach.    The rooms: There are 8 rooms available all of which have identical bathrooms.  The bathrooms have nice showers with good water pressure and hot water.  They have king size beds!  We had an upstairs room which has more space and light.  There were windows on three
50,"We spent four nights here, and lovet it! Our main goal was to relax, and get some tan. This is the perfect place to do that. Laying by the pool was perfect for us. There are four sunbeds and we never had any problem getting one. They also have three tables with chairs, so always a place to sit.  Very comfortable and spacy rooms, with kingsize bed! Lots of places to hang your cloths, and a nice little balcony. No A/C but no need either, there is a nice breeze and we had two fans in the room. Everything is super clean. You also get towels to use at the pool or the beach, which is nice too offer your customers,  They have a nice little kitchen, which was perfect because we had a tight budget. And we where the only one using it, luxury! The restaurants in Puerto Escondido is a bit"
50,"We stayed in the Hotelito Swiss Oasis the beginning of December and LOVED it! It is such a relaxed place to stay with a very 'homey' feel to it. The beds are very comfortable. Also the shower is very nice with plenty of hot water. Manuela and Rene are great hosts, very friendful and helpful. They also have a nice pool and a kitchen + fridge so if you want you can make your own meals. There are plenty of restaurants in the area though but it's nice to have a choice.  The location is great, close to restaurants, shops and the Zicatela beach.  We hope to come back again soon!"
50,The owners are very friendly. The rooms are very clean and the beds confortable. The location is great and quiet. They also have a nice pool.
50,"I went to Puerto Escondido for 3 weeks by myself. I stayed at Swiss Oasis for 10 days and I loved it! I had a room on ground floor with my own hammock outside my door. Room was neat and clean and had a HUGE comfy bed! During my time there, it was pretty quiet. I had the pool basically for myself. There was also several hummingbirds around, which was pretty cool! The owners Manuela and Rene were very helpful. Great hosts! I consider this my home in Puerto Escondido now! Thanks for having me!"
50,"Me and my husband stayed in the Swiss Oasis for 9 days! It was the best place we ever stayed! The location is great, just steps from the beach, sourrounded with the best Restaurants. The rooms are so clean, super cosy, the bed was sooo confortable and there is hot water in the shower. They have fans, windows to both sides, thats maybe why the room was always nice and cool. The windows have moskitonet screens (hard to find in many other hotels).  Before we stayed for one night in another place at Carrizallilo which we booked by internet, but we did'nt like the area nor that Hotel. So, we had a nice sitting area just outside our room. There is also a wonderful pool and a good equipet shared kitchen.   Playa Zicatela is realy the best spot to stay in Puerto Escondido and the"
50,"This is indeed a very nice, quiet place to stay.  We had a ground floor room with a comfortable king size bed (not easy to find in most hotels in this part of the world), with a table and chairs right out our front door, which we used often (even a tablecloth!).  The room was very clean, and the bathroom had super hot water and a nice large shower.  The owners were very helpful and gracious.  The grounds were exceptionally clean with all sorts of different trees and flowers, there was a starfruit tree with ripe fruit during our 4 day stay.  As with everything else, the swimming pool was very clean and enjoyable....and we enjoyed a very acceptable nightly rate of 500 pesos.  Okay, that takes care of the clean and relaxed...so the Hotel is located about 1/2 block up an alley (I"
50,Very looked after here! The owners are so helpful with activities (speak english too) and generally lovely people. Even helped our friend while they were sick. We ended up staying longer.. It's right in the middle of the street. Great pool and facilities. One of the best places we have stayed :-)
50,We were two couples staying at the Swiss Oasis for three nights. The hotelito is very charming with a nice pool and patio and the rooms are very clean and colorful. The owners are very nice and helpful and gave us a lot of tips for the area. The hotelito is located only steps from the beach and a lot of good restaurants for breakfast and dinner are nearby. We really enjoyed this location and truly belief this was the best deal we had in our trip in Mexico.
50,"My girlfriend and I had such a wonderful stay here! It's very charming, safe, inexpensive, and excellently located right of the Zicatela strip. Manuela and Rene, and their animals, were the perfect hosts. In the hot weather, having the nice little pool for midnight dips (when you can't go in the ocean) was great! There's no air conditioning, but there are fans; besides, who wants to drown out the beautiful sounds of the huge waves crashing all night long on Zicatela. Yes, you can hear them from your room! I would recommend this place to anyone!"
50,"My husband and I stayed at Villa Lili for a month and absolutely loved the place.  Adelina was the perfect host and her staff was lovely.  We loved the freshly prepared breakfasts every morning overlooking the pool and garden, and especially the fresh fruit.  The coffee was delicious as well!   Our room had a nice balcony, comfy king bed - and I mean comfy - and had excellent ventilation as well as 2 ceiling fans.  Our room was cleaned everyday which we appreciated, especially after coming back from the beach, all salty & sandy.   We would still be there if we could and hope to return next winter for another stay at the wonderful Villa Lili!  !Gracias Ade'!"
40,"With my girlfriend we stayed in Vila Lili for 5 days, I can say that is very clean and peaceful place with very friendly stuff. The room in the second floor with Jacuzzi is awesome."
50,"before taveling to Puerto Escondido, we had no idea of what to expect, we read the reviews about the Quinta Lili, and later on about Villa Lili, all reports were very encouraging, so we set our sight to Villa Lili and puerto escondido, and we decided to take the plunge and experience the place for ourselves..oooh what a plesant surprise it was, the Hotel is a real hidden Gem, we truley enjoyed staying there, one week of pure sinfull pleasure, excitements, romance, and hospitality on the part of the host/staff...honestly I couldn't think of anything negative to say about the Hotel or the staff (and I'm someone who is very particular about how things should be), they are all extremely helpful and friendly, they have treated us as if we knew them for a long time....if you are going"
50,"We had very high expectations after reading the great reviews on trip advisor before we came, but we were not dissapointed. The place was very clean, quiet and beautiful and within walking distance to a great beach, lovely resturants and bars. But the best thing was the service. They made us feel like we had known them for years, and our stay in puerto escondido would never have been as memorable without all the great tips and help we got from the staff. Thanks for all the fun we had, and all the warmth you gave. We will meet again!"
50,"We found Villa Lilli, online and were charmed by the pictures and the air of serenity it seemed to have. Arriving in Puerto Escondido after a long bus ride from Acapulco, Villa Lilli was the PERFECT place to land. Quiet and secluded, spotless and lit up at night with a wonderful array of gently changing LED lights, the main compound was inviting and ultra relaxed. The staff went out of their way to make sure we were settled properly and provided with all we needed to make out stay enjoyable. Breakfast was always amazing, with a wide assortment of fresh fruit and a different main dish each morning. The view from our room was the best seat in town for the sunset. To be honest, we did not want to leave our little retreat. We would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet"
50,"When you are looking for a special place with personal and very friendly service then I can recommend Villa Lily. I spent a wonderful time there with fishing, whale and dolphin watching and some very exciting trips to waterfalls, the Mexican countryside on horse back or just relaxing in the hotel at the pool. If you fancy good meals I can recommend the restaurant Pascale. on the beach or you can cook your own meals in the kitchen of Villa Lily."
50,"staff and owners of this b&b are the best in customer service we've experienced in a very long time. Behind the 4 walls is a calming beautiful place to return to after a day of sand,sun, and exploring. had a wonderful New Years Eve celebration here with travellers from around the world!"
50,"excellent support for activities, close to the best beach (carrizalillo) with only a short walk to the centre; easy to connect with other guests as well as with staff;  shows Mexico from its best side! thank you, Villa Lili, ¡ya te extraño!"
50,"I spent 9 days at Villa Lili last month and absolutely loved the hotel. My room was large and lovely, with its own balcony overloking the swimming pool, where I swam laps every day. The ladies who made breakfast and kept the hotel spotlessly clean were very friendly and we had many conversations as I worked on improving my Spanish. The owner was very friendly and helpful. She went out of her way to make sure guests had a wonderful visit. It was great having wireless Internet service, which was one of the determining factors in my choosing this hotel. Also, the price was very reasonable considering all the amenities provided. The atmosphere was very relaxed and friendly and the quests staying at the hotel got to know one another over breakfast and around the pool. One guest was a"
50,"I came for a week and stayed two, and left only because I had to work. A beautiful place with an equally beautiful and charming owner, Adelina, who genuinely cares about the peace and comfort of her guests. She went out of her way to ensure my stay was wonderful, taking me to all kinds of places. I cannot convey how incredible it was to watch the sunset from my room every night, after a mid afternoon swim in the pool. Staying there for two weeks, I saw many different people come and go, and all were cared for by the staff with a rare degree of hospitality and generosity. The Villa manages to provide both privacy and the opportunity to meet other people from all over the world, and the food is excellent. I recommend it without reservation."
50,The 4br condo was so beautiful that we extended our stay an extra night. The ocean was so clean and clear with really huge waves. The kids participated in a sea turtle release and had lots of fun with water volleyball. We had 12 people in our party and they had the perfect large table at the outdoor restaurant. Service and food exceeded our expectations and the wine selection was descent. We will definitely be back
50,"My husband and I recently travelled with our three young children (aged 8/5/3) to Vivo Resorts in Puerto Escondido. Vivo exceeded our expectations in every way imaginable. The rooms were spacious, beautifully appointed, and well air conditioned. The concrete construction ensured our room was quiet and the views were beyond breath taking.  We were able to order groceries in advance of our stay, which allowed us to make use of the full size kitchen; though cooking happened less than anticipated because the resort restaurant offered first class dinning at very reasonable prices, in addition they were able to accommodate of all our special requests, which were many, thanks to our young children. There were two pools, an infinity style pool with swim up bar, ocean front for the"
10,"From the moment we arrived at Vivo Resorts, I regretted my prepaid reservation. Having booked close to Easter week, there was not much availability for a last minute reservation, so I chose Vivo. After reading reviews complaining of the construction (it is indeed an active construction sight with limited grounds that are actually completed), I chose an ocean view 1 bedroom (my other option was a partial ocean view studio which was cheaper). The room they gave us was the furthest from the beach with a view of 2 large buildings under construction. On the very far side of the balcony you could sneak a peak of the ocean in between the other buildings. Ofelia the manager was unapologetic and blamed Hotels.com for false advertising. However, this is an investment property that uses"
50,"Stayed in the bottom floor 4 bedroom so confident facing ocean watching whales and dolphins go bye while your making breakfast what more can you say walk 30 ft and you can go in the pool and to the beach. Excellent service day or night a note to the security guards for helping us with our luggage at 5 am what a nice surprise , what a great idea to have the turtle release in front of your condo unit. Versatilegroup@rogers.com for those who would like more info. 20 mins away from puerto Escondido be remote or adventure into town both are great!"
50,"This is a fantastic place. the condos are spectacular and the people are amazingly friendly, whether it is the staff or the current owners. A special shout out to Scott and sara, our hosts for the week. They made this a special week that we will always remember. I can't say enough good things about this. The stay and Play is well worth the money. Yes there is some construction noise, but it becomes background fairly quickly and not really noticeable. Overall, a great experience."
50,We are in the middle of our vacation here but we are loving it!  Unbelievable service. The people are lovely and it is very upscale and the beach looks untouched. We are here for a week but our children are wanting to stay for another month they say!
50,"My wife, daughter, son-in-law and I had a great week at Vivo Resorts and Puerto Escondido. The condo was very nice with a fantastic view and large balcony. There is a really good grocery store in Puerto and we were able to have great meals in the condo, at the resorts restaurant and in Puerto. Most of our time was spent in the two pools at Vivo, the ocean, the nearby Laguna and three great beaches in Puerto. There was lots to do. We probably should have spent more time at the resort just enjoying the great service, the pool bar and the other friendly vacationers. Maybe next time."
50,"A ten minute drive down a bumpy winding road is worth the journey into a welcoming oasis of treasure! ...The pictures are gorgeous , but in reality the entire resort is breathtakingly awesome, even with all the construction going on! The brilliant architecture and craftsmanship of the resort will catch your attention immediately, and designed in such a way that every unit seems to have a spectacular view of either the ocean, mountains or both...The colours draw you in; The plantations, and care put into it, captivate you; The warm, considerate and embracing staff make you wanna live there and the deliciously well prepared & presented food will convince you to live there! ...The ""Play & Stay"" was so impressive, we decided to stay an additional week. And even though we were unable"
40,"This was our first visit to Vivo Resort although we had done lots of research on the property. We travelled with another couple and decided on the four bedroom oceanfront unit for seven days. Although we had two extra bedrooms, we chose this for two reasons, the unit provides the best view in the resort and each couple had its own ‘Master Bedroom’.(Unit 533)  The resort itself is undergoing some expansion and there is construction going on at the rear of the property which runs from Monday to Saturday. Although it may seem to be noisy at first, we found some lounge chairs at the front of the pool and between the surf and the background music it was not a factor. The resort itself is secluded and very relaxing. There are miles of untouched beach with beautiful mountain backdrops."
40,"A long day of travel became very long after finding out we still had a 2 hour drive from HUX airport to the resort. After stopping at Super Che grocery store to get an initial stock up we arrived at the resort which is about 20 mins from Puerto Escondido , the final 5 or so KMs are down a very poorly maintained road that seems to go on for ever.  The finished areas of complex are nicely laid out and well maintained, our only issue was the ice maker for fridge was not turned on but the pool bar gave us a bag of ice to get by until ice maker filled up.  The construction is full on and the constant noise from 7am - 5 pm 6 days a week was at times unbearable, if you are looking for peace and quiet this may not be for you! We knew there was some construction but not too this extent. "
50,"My girlfriend and I spend 5 nights at Quinta Lili. The place is beautiful, the nearby beach is lovely and the service at the hotel was just great. Both the tasty freshly made breakfast each day from Josephina and the help booking tours and finding the right restaurants from Adelina were just awesome, earning Quinta Lili a toprating from us."
50,"We just stayed at Quinta Lilli for 8 nights in April 2012, and had superb vacation in every way.   Loved PE, the hotel, the service and hospitality, the neighborhood, and beaches nearby.  We felt completely relaxed as soon as we checked in and didn't want to leave as we checked out.  I've been to a lot of small boutique-like hotels all over Mexico and this is my new favorite.  PE is unlike a lot of Mexican vacation spots  - it's not resort focused, so you'll see less big hotels and more small hotels like QL.    Quinta Lili sits in the Playa Carrizalillo area, where the most scenic beach in the area is (IMHO).  It's a quiet neighborhood with a cute main street of shops and eateries. It's a 5 min cab or 15-20 min walk to the main beach town where all the surfers/touristy stuff is."
50,"Just got back 6 days ago from Puerto Escondido and stayed at both Quinta Lili and Villa Lili on my recent visit. Both are amazing places and loved the location, rooms, facilities and most importantly the staff - they are so friendly and accomodating. Was a wonderful time!  Stayed in the Master Suite at Qunita lil which has amazing views of the Pacific all the way beyond Playa Zicatella. Enjoyed sitting in my outdoor hot tub for 4 taking in the sunset sipping a glass of of wine - so relaxing! Also loved the balcony - loft in my room to take in the views-sunset. The room is very spacious and while I was busy with so many activities - always loved coming back to my room and hanging!  The facilities are great - nice size pool to relax in after a day out. Great kitchen and sitting"
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed here last May and we had the best time! We were the only people staying for the first half of the week so that was a plus to feel like we had the place to ourselves. Adelina was so helpful and nice. With her help we found the market, tried delicious new foods, and released sea turtles!! Josefina is very sweet, always smiling! We loved having an authentic mexican meal every morning. We will always have great memories of our stay at Quinta Lili  Mindy and Jose! "
50,"We stayed here based on the reviews, posted here. We were not let down! Great place in a relaxed town. We stayed a few days at the end of the trip. The place is located on walking distance from the nicest beach in town (not to full, but still some places with drinks and food) and the rooms were clean and quite new. Breakfast was enough for half of the day so much we got! And the service was really good to, we were dropped off at the busstation at the end of our stay, so no taxi was needed! Really great!!"
50,"The experience started with a complimentary pickup at the airport at 730 in the morning.  We were immediately shown to our room and sat down to a wonderful breakfast.  Everyday started with fresh coffee, local fruit and freshly squeezed orange juice.  We enjoyed a different Mexican breakfast every day and it was all delicious.  Josefina and Adelina made sure we had everything we needed including arranging excursions to release sea turtles and a visit to the lagoon.  We spent everyday at the nearby Carrazalillo beach which was absolutely perfect for relaxing and swimming.  We ate lunch there everyday and found wonderful places to eat nearby each night.  We are definitely going back!"
50,"Our experience is you can't go wrong with trip advisor top choices and Qinta Lili is no exception. It's a delightful place, in a great location with wonderful owner/managers and staff. Can't say enough about this great team - Luis, Adelina and Josefina.  They make it all work."
50,"From the moment I made an internet enquiry about Quinta Lili I was impressed with the service.  Luis answered all questions promptly, showed flexibility when i changed my dates and provided  transport from Puerto Escondido airport on arrival.  And then on arrival I was given an upgrade as I was shown to the master suite on the top floor with the most amazing facilities (king size bed, sun lounges, LCD TV,  private jacuzzietc) and ocean views. king size bed, I thought I was in heaven!   Adelina could not have been more helpful and went out of her way to give me directions, ideas on things to do, book appointments for some pampering and simply chatting and sharing some her own stories.  Josephina was a delight and took great pride in her breakfast preparation, cleaing adn helping"
50,"If you have been reading the reviews this is an award-wiinning and wonderful place. Having stayed there five nights last month's I say ""ditto'. One further indication of how special it is  (and along with everything else- i'm really writing about the attitiude and efforts of Adelina, Luis and Josephina) is their attitude towards ""breakfast hours"". Here, it's when it suits the client. Want a mid-morning breakfast because you are going out early? ""No problem"". and the food is great and thoughtfully prepared too. Go and enjoy."
50,"Quinta Lili is a wonderful, family built and run B&B just a few minutes walk from the quiet beautiful beach Playa Carrizalillo.   Adelina, who co-owns with her 'mysterious' brother Luis, is engaging, informative, gracious, lively and sophisticated.  Josephina, the cook and daytime caretaker, is generous, patient, humorous and thoughtful.   Consider getting a room on the second floor, which comes with your own balcony and nice cross ventilation.   After the beach, hose down outside and dip into the beautiful blue pool."
40,"Absolutely beautiful surrounds.   The view is simply breathtaking - one of the best I've ever seen.   Chose your room carefully - we stayed in both Puebla and Florencia.   Although cheaper, Puebla was definitely my choice - it felt newer, was spacious and the view was spectacular.   The room did not have a private outdoor area though which was the only problem.   I believe Colarado is the pick of the rooms.   The restaurant was adequate -  a lovely setting though compared to the quality we got used to in Mexico the food was not great.   There are some restaurants close by (a short walk) with much nicer food.   Ricardo the bar tender is very helpful and makes a mean cocktail.  Raul, the grounds keep is fabulous.   All in all, a wonderful beach holiday."
50,We spent a week at this jewel overlooking Carrizalillo Bay in Puerto Escondido.  The property has 12 separate villas of differing sizes and locations and is very affordable.  Rooms and grounds are clean and well maintained. The landscaping is lush and tropical.  The new pool and restaurant add to the ambience.  The secluded cove is down the stairs and offers water sports and beach amenities. We enjoyed shopping in the mercado and fixing our meals with fresh ingredients.  Small grocery and restaurants are within walking distance. Sunset at the terrace bar was a highlight.  [--]
50,"When my fiance and I started looking for places to have our destination wedding, Mexico certainly wasn't the first place we considered, but, on the recommendation of a family friend, we contacted the folks at Villas Carrizalillo. We were looking for something relatively easy to get to, and yet not overrun with tourists, and Villas Carrizalillo fit the bill perfectly!  Situated just outside of the main tourist area of Puerto Escondido, Villas Carrizalillo had a secluded feel without the isolation - everything was an easy cab ride or, for the more adventurous, a breathtaking seaside cliffwalk away. We had the whole place rented for ourselves, so we can say with authority that all the villas are equally stunning.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, from putting together"
50,"Well..I will really hate myself for writing this review. When I go back, this great vacation destination will probably be booked with all the folks that read tripadvisor! We really loved this unique casual hotel. I am in the hotel business and travel a lot. We visited with a family group in multiple villas, so we saw them all. Honesty, this is one of the best hotels that I have ever had the pleasure to visit. The views are excellent; the beach is amazing; the villas are sooo Puerto Escondido. The owners and staff are true hosts. Ed and Amy, the owners, were helpful from the first reservation to the last goodbye. Gabriella (?) the manager, and the staff were ight on the mark. The rooms were varied and spacious and clean; each with it's own style. A good choice for families and"
50,"What a heavenly five nights! We stayed in Villa Terrazza, enjoying the huge terrace, the pretty kitchen (only the coffee maker and fridge, but still very convenient) and the gorgeous surroundings. With so many beautiful common spaces, a great restaurant, and a postcard-perfect beach below, it was a struggle to make ourselves leave to experience more of Puerto. Special thanks to the gracious Gabriela at the front desk, who rented us surfboards, called cabs, and made arrangements for day trips, and to Scott, who can make a mean mole AND book you a dive trip at his shop. For the Ritz-Carlton crowd: be aware that the decor is charmingly rustic, and that you will be living surrounded by nature. If finding a 1"" long scorpion in the Jacuzzi will make you run for the hills, this is not"
50,"My husband and I spent a week and a half at Villas Carizalillo at the end of August this year. It's an amazing place to get away from it all.    The Villas are a lovely collection of stand-alone villas and rooms built into a cliff above a small, perfect bay in Puerto Escondido, Mexico. We stayed in a suite called ""Mitla,"" which had the best view of all the entire resort. It had a very private patio/veranda, where we spent many contented hours bird-watching, relaxing, or watching the sun go down.   Because there are no TV and phones in the rooms, Villas Carizalillo gets one away from the stress of our hyper-technical society. They do have Wi-fi access, phones and newspapers for the truly info-addicted. For us, though, it was blissful to have a week and a half completely cut off"
50,"In our opinion, Villas Carrizalillo is the best place to stay at puerto escondido.  The villas are within walking distance from a small beach with great swimming (which we learned is rare in the puerto area due to the strong undertow). Our villa, villa terraza, had a huge patio with hammocks so that you could lounge in the shade, read a book and watch the surfers below.    Its about a $2 cab ride into town or a 40 minute walk which is no problem at all.    Of course we were at Ricardo's bar every night for the best margaritas around and listening to his fascinating stories about growing up in mexico.  The restaurant, Seis Palmas, is getting a make over this September, but was great as it was.  The chef, Scott, is classically trained and has a vision of bringing upscale Oaxacan"
40,"My wife and I arrived at the Villas Carrizallilo after a short hectic stay in Mexico City. We were ready for a bit of paradise. The first thing we noticed upon arrival, was the quiet. The second was the amazing panorama of the bay and sea. What a surprise to sojourn to the hotel restauant and find a well thought-out and delicious menu featuring mainly local produce and seafood. Chef Tony deserves accolades for his wonderful, healthy offerings.  I cannot say enough about the feeling of privacy and  the quiet comfort of the Villas. The staff is is relaxed, very friendly and commited to the quality of the guest's experience. A quiet gem. Go.. enjoy.. and order the amazing shrimp. "
40,"Villas Carrizalillo is an awsome spot to stay at.  We love the villa we stayed in, it had a/c, kitchenette, seperate bedroom with a king size bed. The staff is great, very pleasant. The owner(american) was on the premises and is very nice. (and her dog too) The bar tender, oh yes Ricardo, we love you, you are the best.  We took surfing lessons from Kelly and Silas, great instructors. The beach is a short climb down the step path, and it has a few enramadas that serve fish tacos, beer and pretty much the catch of the day. The villa has snorkeling gear, surf boards and other water sports gear available. Stayed there on our honeymoon and it was very relaxing. Weather you're being adventureous on the beach or just relaxing by the bar to the conversation of new friends (we met some"
50,"We stayed at the villas for 1 week during our honeymoon in August '06 and it was the most memorable part of our entire trip. We stayed in the Puebla villa which had a view of the ocean and a lot of privacy. The rooms are clean, simple and perfect - not luxurious. If you're looking for luxury you should check into a mega resort in Puerto Vallarta. PE is all about simple, friendly beach living.  The grounds of the villas are beautiful as they are perched on a hiilltop overlooking Playa Carrizalillo. Every morning we would wake up and walk down the winding staircase to the beach. We would lay about the beach, or take surf lessons in the calm inviting waters. We often ate lunch at one of the many palapas lined along the beach. The beach is great for novice surfers because there are"
50,"This hotel has been absolutely perfect for us. The pool is lovely! It is very child friendly here (we have no children but if we did we would bring them here). The rooms are so nice and spotless and the staff is really helpful. You can't always buy breakfast here, but we had fun cooking all our own meals. I highly recommend this place. We are sorry that we have to leave it tomorrow!"
50,"Casamar is a lovely landscaped island of calm, with clean apartments each with a balcony or porch for relaxing in Puerto's perfect weather.  You can taxi or walk a mile into town or a few blocks to a beach restaurant or cook in your apartment.  Zicatella Beach is a block away. They have special services are available such as massages, tours and they arranged a wonderful fishing trip for us and even cooked the fish with all the trimmings for us.  My favorite thing of all was to sit by the pool and read.  Because of it's intimate size, the pool area was never loud or crowded.  I can't wait to go back again next year.  This was our third trip!  Many thanks to our hosts Rosalie and Willits!"
40,"First off, the place is gorgeous. I stayed in the smallest room (#8), and it was still a perfectly nice size with a small kitchen and nice bathroom. The grounds are beautiful, the pool sparkling clean, and nice shady palapas next to the pool for reading and hanging out. There were a few things that I wasn't so fond of: It's not a very walkable place in that you pretty much need to take a taxi everywhere (taxis are quite cheap), or at least walk up to the highway and take the collectivos if you want to save a few pesos. And how has no one mentioned the roosters and dogs? I always use earplugs when I travel, and I highly recommend that you have some for this place, as there is no shortage of nightly animal noises in the neighborhood."
50,"My 20 year old daughter and I had never been out of the United States before so we obtained our first passports and headed for Mexico.  We stayed at Casamar for the whole trip and enjoyed the sun and the beautiful surroundings.  The apartment we stayed in was very accomodating and safe with a lazy atmosphere.  We took some day trips and explored Mexico in its traditional state and learned much about the culture and the people.  My daughter likes american food and we were able to find pizza and other fare the we both enjoyed-lobster on the beach for me-.  Each morning we would check our emails to stay in touch with family back home, maybe read for awhile, swim eat warm crouisants and then head out for a day of sight seeing or just enjoying the country side.  I also played some"
50,"I'll start with the bad: the internet never worked in this place, but there is an internet cafe 2 blocks away.  Apart from this we had beautiful rooms, the swimming pool is small but very pleasant, the garden deliciously refreshing. The staff was unrushed in Mexican style, but very friendly, easygoing, and they worked really well.  Very good laundry service (same day wash and fold for a few USD), great coffee and delicious breakfast.   Thehotel is not in the city center but it is 2 blocks from the beautiful beach, catching a cab is pretty easy and walking to the town along the ocean was a lovely exercise.  No question we will come back!"
50,"Relaxing atmosphere with very friendly and helpful staff. Extremely accommodating and great recommendations by manager (Tami). Loved the rooms, the garden, the pool and the massages by Alejandra. We would definitely go back!"
50,"I just returned from a week's stay at Casamar and thoroughly enjoyed my stay there. I started my week with a yoga class held on the third floor open communitiy room and it set a nice pace for the week. The grounds are very well manicured, the pool clean, the rooms very clean, comfortable and authentically decorated. I loved all the tile in the kitchen and bath and the cool walk-in shower with inlaid stones. The staff is very friendly, including the owners and manager who make you feel right at home. The grounds are secured and I felt extremely safe. It is a short walk to the beach, long and uncrowded to walk on and watch the surfers. A few blocks away towards the highway is a bakery run by a swiss couple where you can walk to get your morning croissant, very yummy. Also"
50,Casamar is centraly located to everything we wished to experience in Puerto. The grounds are beautifully manicured and the rooms are clean and quiet.  Tami was very helpfull as were the staff.  Most of all we felt safe and secure.  We will be visiting again next year.
50,"My family has has the pleasure of staying twice at Casamar. What a gem of a place. Spacious beautiful grounds with lush tropical plants and flowers. An inviting pool and only  a short walk to the famous point (beach). Spend the day exploring Puerto with the help and guidance of the caretaker Tami. She knows Puerto well and can recommend outings, restaurants and day trips. Her loyal companion Millie makes casamar feel like home. Not only is Casamar paradise ,the rooms are immaculate and have a Mexican flair. You will love that this little Villa is in a neighborhood where the people are welcoming ,kind and friendly. Casamar is number one! We miss it already."
50,"If you're looking to be pampered in plush resort hotel surroundings, this is not the place for you. If you want to explore old Mexico from a beautiful, clean, safe compound, Casamar is perfect. Large, comfortable, clean, beautifully decorated and fully equiped units serve as a base for great beaches, good restaurants and general exploration of the area. Having a car is a great convenience to get around the town and the area. Secure parking is available inside the compound. This is one situation where the photos on the Casamar website don't lie; the place is as clean and as beautiful as it looks. The manager, Tami, and her staff are friendly and helpful in providing suggestions for things to do and setting up activities (sportfishing, trips to organic coffee plantation,"
50,Our stay at the Villa Lilli was just delightful.  Our breakfasts were great and the staff were all friendly and helpful.  Adelada (spelling?) who runs the place with her brother Luis even drove us to the bus station when we were leaving.  It's a little bit of a walk to the ocean but not bad.  The closest beach is down a long flight of stairs but very nice.  There are other beaches that don't require going down stairs that are a short taxi ride away.  Taxi fare is 20 or 25 pesos and they are always cruising around looking for fares. We would go back in a heartbeat.
50,"We picked Villa Lili right after we read such good reviews about it. We had an amazing time, the place is beautiful, and its perfect to spend some good time there. What I liked even more than the hotel, was the atmosphere you feel while you´re there, a result that you get through  the service from the people that work there, and other guests. It was a great experience getting to know such nice people."
50,"This is a Bed and Breakfast type accommodation. Located near the beach (but not on it) and close to small shops and restaurants. Villa Lili is in a quiet part of Puerto Escondido, which I loved having small kids. The pool is nice. The food is excellent. The ladies who make the meals go out of their way to please you and your family. This is a great place to stay, period. I recommend it with absolutely no reservations. You gotta stay there. Tip. - Fly into Puerto PXM from MEX or OAX (don't do Huatulco and shuttle). From the US fly into OAX (direct from IAH) and then fly to PXM using Aerotucan,"
50,It was my second time in the Villa and it was still the relaxation heaven I remembered.   The staff was kind and helpful. The traditionnal mexican breakfasts were excellent every day and the rooms were well decorated.  The neighboorhood is a bit off-centered but very quiet. It's 5 minutes walk from beautiful beach Carizalillo and 25 pesos taxi ride from main beach (Zicatela).  A good value for your money.
50,"We found this little place in paradise on the net and wanted to go there from the beginning of our vacation planning. .. and it was so worth it!!! Clean rooms, excellent service and great location not too far from all you would want to do on vacation. We had and excellent time at the Villa and met great and inspiring people from all over the world. The service and atttention to the guests was wonderfull and memorable.  We will certainly go back. There is nothing like coming back from the beach and enjoying the beautifull sunset and the birds signing near the pool at the Villa. We had a very enjoyable stay at the Villa."
40,"Villa Lili is a small hotel run by one of the nicest families I've ever met. Ade and Luis (the hosts) are extremely helpful. For us they organized a tour to the closeby lagune close and a surfing course. The building itself is something extraordinary taking influences from boats and submarines. Every room is different and offers something unexpected. We though we had booked a standard twin bed room but soon discovered that our room was a spacious room with a see view and a jaccuzzi on the terrazze! The hotel is not that close to the main beach of Puerto Escondido (a walk to the town centre takes quite a while) but the great beaches of Carrizalillo and Angelito are only a few minutes away. The best about the hotel is, however, the breakfast including not only a good selection of"
40,"a family friendly bed and breakfast a short walk from the best wildlife viewing, surfing beach. relax your days away. stay at the top, its definitely worth the money."
50,"We had a great stay at Villa Lili.  We splurged here and opted for a suite.  It was worth it. We had a spacious room, a balcony and a great view of the water.  Our room was immaculately clean.  Adelina and the staff were extremely nice.  Adelina was also extremely helpful in setting up activities for us (eco/bird boat tour (which was fantastic by the way), massage, surfing class).  She was awesome and took care of everything.  The pool/outdoor area is very nice and well maintained.    Breakfasts were tasty and filling.  Always freshly squeezed juice.  We were kept up late one night by a festival in the plaza, but I don't think that this is a regular occurrence.  We would definitely stay here again."
50,"I spent 3 terrific weeks at Villa Lili in October/ November 2010. My decision to stay at Villa Lili was mainly driven by the excellent rating  they received here at the tripadvisor page and I can say it was a perfect recommendation to follow.  From the first day all the lovely staff made me feel totally welcome. Even my first concerns to be located ""far"" from the village's vivid places were destroyed quickly. Very close to the hotel you can chose between 2 beautiful beaches, Puerto Angel and Puerto Carrizalillo being in march distance of 5 minutes. Optionally, there is always a cab crossing by which takes you for to Playa Zicatela, the most famous but also more crowded beach or to the city center. Besides Puerto offers great things to see which can esily be booked through the"
50,my partner and i stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed it immensely. it has a great location with a cute strip of restaurants only 2 min walk and the best beach of peurto escondido very close by. the staff here were very warm and friendly and extremely helpful. they are such a lovely family who may even talk you through their orchid garden if you're lucky! breakfast was superb and greatly anticipated every morning with such variety!  i particularly enjoyed sharing the breakfasts with other guests at the large communal dining table overlooking the lap pool. i cannot recommend this place highly enough - for people not sure if they want to spend a little extra on accommodation - my advice is; IT'S WORTH IT! we will most definitely be going back someday...
40,"This a small quiet hotel just off the beach front.  The rooms were quiet and clean. Manuela & René were helpful in advising me as to which tours for fishing,  scuba diving and horse riding to use.  This hotel is near all the best restaurants and bars but is miraculously quiet."
50,"If you just need a nice place to stay - no fancy extras but plenty of *hot* water, come to the Hotelito! Great people and location."
50,"I arrived to this place with my mother and sister for new years and had a great time. It felt like being at home with the hospitality and they were all very friendly and curious. It is very close located to zicatela beach and the town. Within minutes of restaurants, bars, beach and everything Puerto Escondido has to offer. Would recommend!"
50,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Swiss Oasis for 3 nights and loved it.  The rooms are super clean, cute and have some little details that we liked.  The owners, Manuela and Rene, are very helpful and appear to love help their guests with any wishes they might have.  The two of them really take care of their guests."
50,"Stayed at the hotelito for two weeks. The hosts, Manuela y Rene  took care of every last one of my needs and beyond. It is refreshing  to see hosts that still understand the meaning of hospitality.This is the place to stay in Zicatela. It is a haven weary travelers can call home away from home. Because that's what it is. It makes everyone feel comfortable and cozy.  The rooms are clean, so is the pool.  You are in the center, basically at the beach, yet just a tad removed from the hustling and bustling, so you can get a good nights sleep. A definite *****"
50,Maybe not the cheapest place but definitely the most quiet and clean place in puerto with very spacious rooms (some) on two floors. And they have a pool! We planed to stay two nights but end up to stay over a week...
50,"this place was really the highlight of staying in escondido.  off the beaten path - but just a tiny bit - the value was really unbeatable.  being swiss, the owners make sure the place is super clean and well put-together, the pool is always great and they make sure to keep the fridge stocked with extremely modestly priced beer.  hosts manuela and renee, along with their cats are super hospitable and relaxed, and make it their priority to make sure everyone is having a good time.  i don't expect this place to be the same price the next time i go down - it was an absolute steal for the two weeks i was there."
50,"I am an American who lives in Oaxaca City.   I have spent time at the Hotelito in January and I just returned from 4 days there in April.  Manuela and Rene are wonderful hosts.  I guess it says something when an American, who lives in Mexico already ,heads down to the Hotelito to relax!  I am an avid motorcyclist and like nothing better than the 6-hour trip from Oaxaca to Puerto Escondido when I want to get away for a few days.   Manuela and Rene are happy to accommodate my BMW and make sure she's safe whenever I visit. For my motorcyclist compadres - this is a motorcycle friendly establishment.   Always spotlessly clean.  Comfortable beds - I sleep like a stone.  Incredibly tranquil location 50 yards from the Pacific.  I will return again and again."
50,"Had a wonderful stay, together with my brother Alessandro, at Hotelito Swiss Oasis during 2009 Christmas Break. I had already been in Puerto before and loved the place, but the owners Manuela and Renè made our stay even more pleasant. Those guys have travelled all around the globe and finally decided to settle down and chose Puerto as their dream place to live. Listen to their stories, they'll give you the most useful tips you were ever given about travelling, adapting to different cultures and habits, and just live every day as if it was your last.  Have a cerveza with them in the porch, and you won't regret it. Having had also the pleasure to meet their cat Susie, I can only wish to both Manuela and Renè the best of luck down in that corner of paradise, and hope be back and"
40,I went to Vivo to look as an investment.  The building and suites are awesome.  Meticulously built.  I stayed in the 1 bedroom penthouse and a two bedroom further back from beach.  Construction was ongoing and will be for years to come.  If you want to get away and enjoy the sound of the surf this is it.  It is a long trip to get there from Hautulco airport.  Recommend flying yo Mexico city and take one of the local airlines for about 100 bucks to Puerto Escondido.  Otherwise a 2 hour drive and cost is $150 for shuttle provided by Vivo.  I decided against the investment which was probably bad call but as no golf and shuttle to town was $25 each way to just get to town. Figured may not be the time for renting to tourists.  Had the resort had a free shuttle on a regular schedule
30,I went with friends for NYE 2016 and had fun. The viva resort is an unfinished resort in middle of nothing. Just to leave the resort for any activity cost time and money (50 min at least to puerto escondido main street and 7 people round trip  cab for usd$80.00 aprox). Crew service is poor and does not match with the luxury rooms. Thera are rooms next resort office and noise in morning is a nightmare.
50,"We stayed last October! This place is great! Right in the middle of nowhere. Literally the only thing there is the hotel, so bring your souvenirs. The suites are brand new and awesome. When we stayed there was construction going on, they offered a discounted rate because of that. They do have a limited menu though."
40,"My husband and I had the pleasure to stay at this lovely resort for two weeks.  If you want to experience a piece of Mexico that is  not too commeralized then this is the place for you. It has a 12 km length of one of the best beaches I have been on.  The waves were intense when we were there so I did not venture into the water too far.  However, if you want the experience, John will be happy to take you.   A car really should be on your list to rent, it will make your experience that much more enjoyable.  This resort is off the beaten path.  I would have given Vivo a 5, however, they are in the throws of construction which made it noisy.  The construction went on from aprox 8-5 daily.  Once the construction is done I can only imagine how lovely this place will be.  The"
50,"The suites are great, fully equiped and spacious. Amazing view from our balcony, and the pool was great! looking to the ocean, I hope we can comeback soon.  I saw a new pool getting built, looks fantastic."
50,"Just returned from a great trip to Puerto. Stayed at Casamar in the Brisas section of town. VERY clean and comfortable.Tammi, the manager, was extremely helpful. The staff was friendly. Catalina made wonderful breakfasts! Planning to return as soon as we are able."
50,"My husband and I kicked off our honeymoon this summer at beautiful Casamar Hotel in Puerto Escondido. I could not have asked for a more relaxing, comfortable, and pleasurable experience than what we found here at this treasure.   Away from the hustle and bustle of growing Puerto Escondido, yet only a short cab or 'colectivo' ride into town, we spent long, lazy days on our private patio overlooking the ocean and the very close 'La Punta' - the Mexican pipeline. When we did manage to leave the comfort of our apartment (with full bath and kitchen), we were swimming in the pool (the dogs were NOT a problem at all and did not come in the water unless invited), walking the sandy, warm beaches, and eating at the wonderful restaurants lining the coast of Puerto Escondido.  The grounds"
30,Gorgeous property but I'm not sure I'd stay there again as it's too far from town if you don't have a car. Plus although I like dogs I'm not keen on sharing a swimming pool with them. The meal I ate on site was nicely presented but not really recommended for the  price.The grounds are nicely landscaped.
50,"I stayed in studio #1 at Casamar for 12 days in March, and my stay was so wonderful. What I most appreciated about Casamar are the authentic touches in the room decor--hand painted tiles in kitchen and bath, beautiful art work, and a great swimming pool just outside the door.  The resort is not in the 'downtown' area, but it was just a short cab drive into the main shopping area. But this mini-resort is very close to La Punta, the Point, which is know to the surf community as the Mexican Pipeline. I didn't surf, but I did take a boogie boarding lesson, which was so much fun and the surf is always roaring.  I have been to Mexico many times before, but this time the experience felt very authentic and I got a glimpse into the Real Mexico. The staff at Casamar is very gracious, as"
50,"We've traveled all over Central America, and Mexico keeps calling us back, especially Puerto Escondido, and the Casamar is our second home.  With only 12 apartments, it is a quiet complex with a lovely pool and gardens, and the rooms are spacious, airy, cozy, and comfortable.  We feel completely at home here, and that's the way Willits and Rosalie want their guests to feel.  Puerto has it all: the real Mexico and any amenity a traveler could want.  There is no more beautiful spot in the world.  We've stayed at the Casamar three times in three different rooms, all equally charming.  Can't wait to go back next year."
50,"Great staff, great rooms, unreal cleanliness and safety, You will not be disappointed. I stayed here 2 weeks last summer and had the chance to see the other hotels in the area. Some others might be bigger, but none are as clean and well staffed. You will see lots of hotels that seem nice but the service is really what makes Casa Mar stand out.  Enjoy!!!  -Bobby "
50,"Puerto Escondido is one of the best places I have visited in this world. Especially if you love to surf, enjoy the beach and meet friendly laid-back people.        Since Puerto is a small surf town in Mexico, it doesn't have all the amenities that someone from New York may be accustomed to, yet when I walked into Casamar I felt I had found Paradise.  With 11 brand new apartments, a pool, a lovely garden, meal and maid service, internet, all located one block from the beautiful Zicatela Beach and at a good price, I can't imagine much more to be desired.         The woman who manages the property and lives there, as well became a friend throughout my stay and was a constant source of information.  I was surprised to read the prior review on this website as I found the staff and"
50,"This is a charming place well situated.  Just a short cab drive away from the Adoquin, market and other beaches.  A close 5 minute walk to the best swimming beach Carrizalillo  with lots of great little eateries all within walking distance.  The hospitality along with great owners as well as Josephina who will greet you every morning and prepare you a delicious mexican breakfast every morning will make your stay a great experience!"
50,"My husband and I stayed at Villas Carrizalillo for a week during our honeymoon & loved it!  The location is perfect- far enough away from Zicatela to be quiet at night, but a quick cab ride to great restaurants and nightlife.  It is right on playa Carrizalillo- a beautiful, clean beach and a great place for snorkeling!  The water there is quite calm, so its a great place to swim too!  The villas themselves have beautiful views- the balcony was perfect for watching the sunset while having a cocktail.  Ours was nicely decorated, very comfortable, and immaculately clean.  The staff a the villas is very friendly and helpful.  They are great resources for info on restaurants and activities and give the place a great laid-back family feel.   Their restaurant (which recently opened)"
50,"Quinta Lili is a beautiful little hotel just near Carizalillo beach. It has 5 bedrooms, a pool and a nice eating area for breakfasts or drinks. It is so relaxing and peaceful staying here and relaxing by the pool and enjoying the authentic mexican breakfasts cooked by Josephina. The owners are so helpful and accomodating. They have great recommendations for each visitor depending on what you like from great restaurants, a nice place for a walk with a view, tours and water sports etc. Very generous and kind people. The rooms are simple, nice, clean and absolutely all you need in an environment like puerto escondido. The pool was a nice temperature to cool off in. The location is perfect - its a quieter part of puerto escondio, quite undeveloped so you don't feel like you are with"
50,"Although everything was charming about this hotel, what really made it stand out among all the others in P.E. was the staff and the breakfasts!. Adelina was there every morning with Josefina to chat about our day, arrange exursions, and make us a different Mexican breakfast speciality every morning. They helped us begin to understand the language, culture, foods, and ecosystem of the area. This helped us avoid the usual totally tourist experience, and gave us the courage to use our spanish and explore the culture more. And we even got a hug when we left!"
50,"Our seven days at Quinta Lili and Villa Lili were an absolute pleasure. Adelina, Luis, Josefina and Fernando are delightful hosts, gracious, enthusiastic and accommodating in every way. The ""spontaneous"" New Year's Feast they prepared was above and beyond, and made for an extraordinarily festive debut for 2012. I've promised Josefina to improve my Spanish, because I next time I'm there, helping myself to copious cups of the delicious Oaxacan coffee that Adelina provides, I want to learn more about what's going on behind those sparkling eyes. Muchos gracias!"
50,"In all the hustle and bustle of mexico it's great to have a place like Quinta Lili to come back to...just the perfect little oasis of calm. Our room was perfect, ground floor and opening out onto the pool..bed to pool in less than 5 paces. The location may not be where people would initially think they need to be in Puerto Escondido but it really was ideal and we loved it. Playa Carrizalillo is 5 mins walk away (yes down some steep steps but it's really worth every step!) and we found it to be the best beach around for swimming and had a great day learning to surf there also (we tried the others through our stay and didn't like them as much). Anywhere (even the Punta) was a max of 35 pesos taxi away and there were plenty around all the time so no transport issues at all. There's"
50,"It was our first time visiting Puerto Escondido, I traveled with my wife for our honeymoon. We were very happy we got to stay at Quinta Lili, Adelina and Josefina are very friendly and made us feel at home. Every morning Josefina cooks a delicious breakfast, Adelina comes by and greets all of the guest. The hotel is very nice and private, it has a great location it is at walking distance from restaurants and Carizalillo beach. There is nothing I disliked about our stay at Quinta Lili, what I liked the most is the friendly service. Adelina was very helpful, she helped us book tours and made sure we got the best service. This is definitely the best place to stay in Puerto Escondido. We were very sad to leave Josefina and Adelina, we still have communication with them and hope to"
50,"Just got home after 9 days in PE at the Quinta Lili. The best vacation we have been on. The staff, our new friends, Adelina, Josefina, and Fernando made the stay the best. We had a great time. Can't wait to go back!!"
50,"We just spent New Years Eve at Quinta Lilli on our 4th time at this wonderful oaisis of calm and tranquility in Puerto. We were fortunate to finally meet Luis, who is ,as hard as it might seem, as charming and thoughtful as his sister Adelina, who we consider a part of our family.  Since our last trip they have done some upgrading to the units, without distracting from the original charm.  We brought some friends along this  time and dispite all of our ""hype"" they could not have been more pleased.   Hope to see you next year, we will be there."
50,"I stayed with a friend as we travelled across Mexico a few years ago (July 2009), but looking back it seems my review never made it to tripadvisor so here's another one.   We found Quinta Lili on hostelbookers and thought it looked nice. When we arrived, we were dumbstruck; this isn't a hostel, it's a boutique hotel! From the moment Adelina picked us and our luggage up and drove us to the hotel, we were in awe of the friendly service and gorgeous surroundings (Puerto Escondido is just absolutely brilliantly stunning and you simply must visit.) The hotel is just up the road from a parade of shops and cafes/restaurants, and near the steps down to a private little beach, but we actually found ourselves spending a lot of time in the hotel itself, or on local excursions that Adelina"
50,"My mother and I travelled to Mexico from New Zealand. We found our hosts Adelina and Josephina to be wonderful, friendly and welcoming. They cooked the most beautiful breakfasts and adelina spoke excellent English. They were always helpful with information and things to do. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend staying here to anyone, especially if you are novice tourist like ourselves. Thankyou Adelina and Josephina     "
50,"I've stayed elsewhere in Puerto and enjoyed my time there, Hotel San Juan. I love family run businesses with a ""real"" atmosphere. The ""Villas"" provide this plus an excellent location and terrific accomodations.   Amy and Ed are remarkable hosts, even with a newborn they are there when one of their great staff are not able to help. As someone mentioned in another review, Ricardo does make amazing margaritas. In fact, I only make them his way now and have passed along the method to anyone willing to learn.  The Villas are located at the end of a dirt road, which makes for a longer walk to where you want to go but not like it is that much of a hassle. We did the walk a few times but when we want to be somewhere quick we took a cab and they were cheap. We were constantly reminded"
40,"We stayed at the Villa's end of May and loved the place. If you don't mind being a bit out of town, then this is where you should be. The villa's are very spacious and clean, and the view over the cliffs is amazing. We wanted to take some surfing lessons, and it's perfectly located on the beginners beach. Also, the beach is great for swimming as the wave are not too big and it's not too crowded. It's really easy and cheap to get a taxi into town. Also, we wanted to leave a day earlier as it rained quite a bit, and the receptionist was very flexible to change our booking. Would recommend this place. "
50,"If you have not heard of this place, and your thinking about going to mexico, you havn't researched enough. The staff are amazingly friendly and Ricardo who attends the bar every night at 5pm makes Mexicos best Margaritas hands down. The accomodation is clean, authenticaly decorated and perched upon the hillside overlooking a nearly private beach for the guests. After lazing on the beach, swimming in turquoise waters and sipping lemonada under the palapas (thatched roof huts on the beach that serve food and drinks) the walk back up to the villas is a bit of a killer, however when heaven awaits you at the top, who cares right! This place is about a 3 minute taxi ride into town (Zigotela beach) which will cost you about 35 pesos, currently about $3.50 US. It is great to visit the"
50,"My husband and I have vacationed annually or bi-annually for over twenty years throughout Mexico. Vacations were beginning to feel like ""been there, done that.""  We were ready for a new Mexican experience.  Based on positive comments heard about Puerto and Villas Carrizalillo, we spent a week there in February. Our expectations were exceeded and our stay at the Villas was the frosting on the cake.  PUERTO:  Felt like we were really in Mexico.  Puerto was pleasant, laid back, easy to get around on foot and cabs were inexpensive and plentiful.  No need to rent a car.  RESTAURANTS:  Overall very good food, gracious service and reasonably priced.  If you are into seafood, this is the place.  ACTIVITIES:  Outstanding beach vacation spot; in fact, going to the beach was our daily"
50,"A beautiful cliff-side location of peace and traquility, just minutes away from as much hustle and bustle as you may care to indulge yourself in shopping or restaurants. Amy Hardey has done a wonderful job of creating a perfect laid-back setting amongst tropical landscaping. Each villa is unique, kept spotlessly clean by a dedicated staff. The kitchens are complete and the villas are air-conditioned, have ceiling fans and hammocks. My wife and I spent three weeks there and we enjoyed every moment. Amy and her partner, with their beautiful new baby, create a very home-like feeling not to mention their two great dogs, Zelda and Dudley. And for those of you who are blue-water sailors, we saw four green flashes at sunsets while we were there! Beautiful beaches are just steps away."
40,"This is a lovely oasis just outside the ""hub bub"" of town & beach frenzy. Rooms are clean & comfortable, the terrace a wonderful place to sip a margarita while watching the sunset. Just a short (tho steep) walk down to a beautiful beach and swimming area. A really nice place to do as little or as much as you like. Highly recommend! "
50,5 of us stayed here together in November 2005 for a week and absolutely loved it. The hosts were friendly and helpful - even drove us to the hospital when my fiance hurt his ankle. The whole place had a very relaxed atmosphere. It's a steep walk down to the beach but worth it. A fantastic place if you want to self cater. You can also walk into town or get a taxi for restaurants. I would definitely return!
50,"This hotel and the services hosts Amy and Ed provide are absolutely first class.  The suites are spacious, immaculate and well equipped, the grounds are kept beautiful, and it's location perched atop the mountain with spectacular vistas of and easy access down to the semi-secluded and safe beach all make this quaint and comfy hotel ""a must"" as far as my wife and I are concerned.  The guest guide provides very helpful information about the nearby sites, activities and restaurants. You're walking distance to the other beaches and restaurants.  As residents of Oaxaca, we'll be back time and time again. Thanks so much for all you provide...you've redefined ""value-added service"" for us. "
50,"Possibly the best travel experience I have ever had.  It doesn't hurt, of course, that I got engaged at Villas Carrizalillo (on the balcony of the Puebla room), but even without that high point biasing my view, this is simply a superb place.  As others have mentioned, staying here is like having your own private beach.  The Carrizalillo beach is less visited that the two main beaches in town, in part because it is difficult for the public to access.  Not so from the Villas!  You have a private staircase down.  Add to that Amy, hostess extraordinaire, and your own little bar on the terrace.  I could stay here for months.  As a rule, I prefer not to travel again to places I've already been -- there is too much of the world to explore and too little vacation time to see it.  I'll"
50,"Hi everybody, My wife and I recently stayed at Villa Lili for 4 days. After an ""intense"" 8 hour-bus trip through the mountains between Oaxaca and Puerto Escondido, what a relieve to discover such a beautiful place! Architecture, rooms, service, hospitality...I'm a big traveller and I honestly can tell when a place is worth it. It's definitely the case for Villa Lili where Luis and Adelina really welcome us as if we were at home. Never intrusive, always helpfull, these young mexicans have already understood it all about  hotellery business and personalized service. The room was just amazing (jacuzi helps :) with its unforgetable seaview, fresh and healthy breakfasts,  discret and effective staff, perfect cleaning and Luis & Adelina always ready to help if you have any query. For"
50,"Granted I had made reservations with Villa Lili because of all the emphatically positive reviews on this website, I still was not wholly prepared for how incredibly accommodating and gracious the family of Villa Lili actually are until my wife and I arrived. I had made several ridiculous requests to impress my wife for our anniversary (room filled with flowers, champagne, chocolates and a mariachi band...), and not only did they indulge each request, they easily went beyond any expectation I had. (And I apologize in advance to the staff for making this information public, lest it gives anyone else the idea to impress their spouse/partner with the talents of the staff and they have to go through that again).  The rooms and building are a refreshing mix of beach vernacular and"
50,"so far this has to be our most favorite town in mexico, the hospitality in this villa was amazing!"
50,"I had an excellent stay at Villa Lili, the friendly hosts and staff made my time in Puerto Escondido truly enjoyable. Whether you're there for eco-tourism, the surf, or the great Oaxacan Food, they can help you find your way around. My room was cleaned daily, beautiful architecture, I felt completely at home."
40,"Situated on the edge of a Mexican residential road in Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca is an inviting small hotel, Villa Lili.  After a 1 1/2hr flight from Mexico City and a short taxi ride we were greeted and escorted by one of our hosts up a short beautifully tiled set of stairs to our lovely, bright, and spacious room.   While there was no view of the ocean on our floor, the white stuccoed walls and vibrant blue tiles of the pool under a palapa offered a pleasing sight to the eyes and rest to the soul.  After we admired the architecture and absorbed the details of our room we made our way to the communal space which included the serene lap pool and open kitchen where we were to enjoy our delicious full Mexican breakfasts over the next few days.  Tasty coffee, freshly squeezed juice,"
50,"Villa Lili is smack mouth gorgeous, like strolling through architectural digest! Breakfast in their outdoor cucina is likely to be your best meal of the day! The rooms are impecable! The staff is the most polite, friendly and courteous group on earth! If Puerto Escondido was not such a beautiful place there would be no compelling reason to wander past the front door of Lili."
50,"Villa Lili is fantastic - from the point of view of a solo traveller, after a few hours I felt like I was part of a big family. The hosts are magnificent, the house has personality in every corner, the owners have put a lot of thought and passion into every detail. The rooms are amazing, the breakfast out of this world. If you stay in Villa Lili, you have the chance to make your stay a true experience that you will remember for the rest of your life instead of just passing through as a tourist. It's a little piece of paradise..."
40,We stayed here for 3 nights and had a great time. Vila Lili is close enough to all beaches but far enough away to offer privacy. All the staff are amazing and nothing is to much trouble for them. I became I'll on the last day and we were allowed to use the room all day at no extra cost. That is true service. Also the breakfast is amazing. Can recommend this place enough
50,"After six months traveling in Mexico, I can say without a doubt that Villa Lili is the absolute best place to stay. The hotel itself is gorgeous and all the little design touches make it really special. Our room was gorgeous. I'll never forget waking up to see the ocean from bed. Everything is cleaned daily so you never have to worry about bugs or sand. The breakfast was amazing! And most of all, all the villa lili family feel personally responsible for making sure your visit is enjoyable. Our first day, they spent almost an hour going over everything on the map with us and adding all the restaurants along the way. You might be able to find something cheaper in this area, but you will not find a better place to stay. Trust me that it's worth a little extra."
50,I stayed there with a friend and we had a great time!  The owners and staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  The rooms were spacious and super clean!  Loved my stay there and I would reccomend it to anyone heading to Puerto Escondido!!!
50,"We loved Puerto Escondido and Quinta Lili.   Ade and Josephina made us feel right at home at the B&B, which is just a short walk from a beautiful bay beach.     There were just enough nice restaurants, and things to do to keep us entertained, though the beach was where we spent most of each day."
50,"Beautiful rooms, excellent location and attentive staff.  Helped make our time in Puerto Escondido perfect."
50,"We recently stayed at Quinta Lili for a few nights and it was exceptionally hard to leave (planned on 2 nights and stayed 4) We were on our honeymoon and stayed in the penthouse suite that was exceptional value for money. Luis answered our email immediately and booked us in, so no problems with communication. Josephina and Claire made our stay absolutely perfect! Great food and great people! Wish we could of stayed much longer.  The PERFECT beach within a few minutes walk and all amenties very close by. If you want to stay close to town but still have privacy and a good chill out place this is it.  Thank you very much again for all the special touches and hospitality!"
50,"Wow, best place we stayed at in Mexico. It was great they all could,t have been more helpful. Nothing a problem, helped in anyway they could. So easy to book, pick up from airport was a breeze, rooms great, staff oh so lovely, breakfast wonderful, great advice on a the area n surrounds. Even helped us learn Spanish. Claire n josephina thank you again. The browns"
50,"We are couple on honey moon traveling for three month in Latin America and Quinta Lily is definitely the best place we stayed in! It is located in a quite place, close to Manzanillo beach, which is a perfect piece of heaven. Quinta Lily has 5 rooms, a bit different but all are very nice and clean. the pool is nice and the area around is perfect for relaxing after a hole day on the beach. Every morning we got a wonderful breakfast, which was made fresh in front of us by 2 nice mexican Ladies, including coffee, juice, cereals and delicious tacos. The Owners were so nice, hosted us like family and took care of everything we needed. we highly recommend this place for staying in Puerto Escondido!!!"
50,"I spent 3 weeks travelling through Mexico and of all the really nice hotels & B+B's I stayed in in Mexico City, Playa del Carmen, Puebla and San Cristobal de las Casas, this was - hands down - a pure piece of heaven. I stayed here 4 nights but would've happily decamped for a lot longer except that my flight home was booked.  Aside from the gorgeous rooms, playful architechtural design, breezy balcony, tasty breakfasts, spotless pool & the 5 minute walk from Playa Carrizalillo (with fantastic waves for surfing, boogie-boarding & swimming), Claire & Josefina made my stay completely effortless - helping to organise everything from surf lessons, trips to the Manialtepec lagoon, the wierd but wonderful Temazcali experience to a post surf lesson massge. Seriously - the service here is"
50,"This was my second time in Puerto Escondido and my second stay in the lovely Quinta Lilly. I really love this place. The rooms are quiet, clean and comfortable, so is the bathroom. The breakfast is excellent: Fruits and Mexican style breakfast, fresh orange juice and coffee. The Carizallilo Bay is just a 5 minute walk away. And if you wanna go to central Puerto Escondido a cab is just 25 Pesos. The people who work at the Quinta Lilly are very charming and extremely helpful with everything. They pick you up at the airport and take you there when you leave. They book excursions for you and help you with any problem you might have. I will definitely come back."
50,"Quinta Lily is super in many ways: the house is Gaudi-like beautiful with very comfortable rooms. We even had a small fridge in our room. The situation is very good, it's only a little walk to a beautiful beach and there are a couple of good restaurants nearby. Above all we are very enthusiastic about host Adelina who goes to every trouble to help you and make you feel at home. She took us to the airport very early in the morning when we were moving on. Together with Josefina, a lovely lady too, they made us delicious breakfasts. We certainly would like to go back there one day. John en Mieke Davies"
50,"We had a wonderful stay at Quinta LIli. The rooms are lovely and full of comfort, breakfasts are absolutely scrumptious and everything is thought to the last detail to offer homely comfort to the lucky guests. The house is a short walk away from the beach and a lovely pool awaits you for a dip when you get back. The lovely host knows just how to help you make the most of the natural beauty of Puerto Escondido and her unique hospitable warmth made our stay one that we will never forget."
50,"I could write a whole story about this hotel, but I'll try to be short: DO COME HERE!!! it's just a great and wonderfull place which feels more like a home than a hotel. Thanks to Adelina, whose probably by far the best host we have ever met!! We loved every minute staying here and we'll try to come back some day!"
50,After staying a week on bustling Zicatela I found the hidden oasis of Villas Carrizalillo.  Absolutely perfect.  With what seemed like my own private beach I finally found the paradise I was looking for.   The staff was wonderful and Amy (the host) was more than happy to set up both spanish and surf lessons to fit our schedule.  And then we still had plenty of time to enjoy sunset margaritas at the terrace bar.  Can't wait to go back! 
50,"This hotel is terrific.  Beautiful setting overlooking playa carrizalillo - with steps to the beach.  Each room unique, all with kitchens, some with incredible views.  The hotel is very well run and Amy and the rest of the staff couldn't be better.  Peaceful and quiet - a perfect setting. "
50,"Getting to Puerto was rather painless.  NYC to Mexico city, non-stop.  Than a short flight to Puerto Escondido.  Villas Carizalillo is a 5 min. taxi from the airport.  The Villas is an oasis of palms.  It is built on a cliff right over the Pacific.  Our room was actually built in the cliff with heavenly views and very clean.  The Host, Amy, is perfect.  Not to miss; sunset massage under the palapa.  I'll see you there in April. "
50,"The room was so comfortable large.. I'm sure we could play football in there. Sleeping was no problem at all. We went sight seeing, diving in the bio luminescence lagoon near by at night. That's something I thought only existed in fantasy movies. I went surfing of course and we were very close to the famous surf beach Playa Zicatela. Staff were very friendly all the time, always smiling. Adelina was full of energy, very positive all the time and best of all knew everything about the area. We also went to the Mexican suana called a temazcal.   Whoever stays here no matter what they are looking for they well find it."
40,"Villas LILI , beautiful, clean , confortable bed , wonderful view, excellent rooms , delicious food & best of all out of this world customer service. Adelina & his brothers treated us like part of their family. We really had a wonderful experience staying at Villa LILI."
50,"Our Mexican friends suggested to visit Oaxaca when we were unsure where to start as Mexico is so huge! I have to say, this was the best move we ever made. Puerto Escondido was the last stop on our tour before we left the country, we spent 5 days there. And what a great place. Major part of the experience was Villa Lili. We arrived without knowing much of the place or what we would do there but Adelina was briliant, friendly (even 7 in the morning when we arrived :)) and had a whole list of amazing things to do, she also helped in organizing all! I truly can say that the experiences we had were unique, swimming in fluorescent water in the middle of the night in a hot lagune - where else can you do that? The surf is really good there, the water very warm and even in the rainy"
50,"I read the views for this place and thougt that it sounded too good to be true.  Can the hosts really be that friendly and welcoming?  Could the place really be that beautiful inside and out?  Well, as pesimistic as can be about over inflated reviews on these sites sometimes, this place is truely wonderful.  The hosts really did make sure we were well looked after and I was actually very happy relaxing on site rather than head outside in the evenings!  Dont be put off by the location if you want something close to the beach as everytging you need is also within easy reach.  We definitely made the right choice of staying at Villa Lili (also seen as Quinta Lili)...."
50,Evn if the hotel is not so cheap i was delighted of my choice. The owner and the emplyees where so friendly and everything was so fine.  I would love to come back.
50,"We stayed at Villa Lili for a week and everything was awesome! The place is beautiful, and Adelina and the staff are fantastically friendly and helpful. Adelina goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and to help with anything you need. Our room (and the entire Villa) was immaculate and always maintained that way. Breakfast was delicious and a great way to start every day. Was nice to chill by the pool after a day at the beach,... and crank up the  jacuzzi in our room with a glass of bubbles. Can definately recommend staying at the Villa for longer than you planned."
50,it was really a very nice place to stay...the breakfast is amazing and the staff is perfect Thanks again we will be back Sally from France.
50,Quick and helpful response when booking on-line.  Transfer to/from airport organised by staff.  Very welcoming.  Good recommends on what to do/where to eat locally.  Good location if learning to surf in Playa Carrizalillo.  Reliable wifi!  Nice place to relax and only 5 minutes in a taxi to Zicatela.
50,"We stayed for 4 nights at the Villa Lili and it was an awesome stay! We cannot wait to go back. We are students from the US that have been studying/traveling through Mexico for the past 3 months. We looked up reviews on this website to help us decide on where to stay for our time in Puerto. All of the reviews were right on...Villa Lili is the best hotel in Puerto! We had to make some last minute changes to our reservation about a week before arriving, but Luis was more than accommodating. He always got back to my emails promptly. When we arrived, we were offered transportation to the Villa Lili. When we arrived, our room was ready and very clean! They had fresh towels for us each day, and the room was beyond clean every afternoon by two very nice girls. We had the Exotica Suite"
50,"I just got back from Puerto Escondido and I really miss this place already!  The town itself is super tranquil and just a great place to relax and soak up some sun and surf.  The food is freaking amazing in this part of Mexico!!!  If you've never had Oaxacan cheese and chocolate, that is practically worth the trip itself.  We stayed at Villa Lili, which I must say is now my favorite hotel.  The room was super cool with a lots of character and details that you don't find everywhere.  For instance, we had a water fall in our room and an really great jacuzzi whirlpool.  There are lots of little details that they put into this place that really made it stand out including cool lighting and artistic tile work.  Even better than the look of the place was the people they have working"
50,"From the moment we landed in Puerto Escondido, we received royal treatment from Quinta Lili's Adelina, who manages this and another Inn she owns with her brother, Luiz. A courtesy van whisked us from the airport to the inn where Adelina greeted us with the world's warmest and most welcoming smile.  After we rested and got out bearings after an overnight flight from L.A., Adelina sat down with us and--in perfect English, thank goodness!--outlined everything we needed to know to get around easily and enjoy our week in Puerto Escondido. She suggested specific restaurants and excursions, taking care to explain what to expect in each locale. She hooked us up with a surfing outfit whose owner personally ensured that our teenage daughter held her own amongst the locals at the famous"
50,"The wonderful reviews of Quinta Lili are all true.  Adelina is the consumate host and innkeeper.  She really goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable and gives you information you need to make your stay enjoyable.  If you like big resorts and indifferent service--this is NOT the place for you.  Quinta Lili is located in a residential neighborhood but walking distance to shops, restaurants, one of the most beautiful beaches (Playa Carrizallio), and taxis.    You feel like you are a guest at your cool Mexican friend's beach house.  That said, this is a great opportunity to practice Spanish, interact with locals, other travellers and discover the REAL Mexico (fresh food, mexican-time, rain, humidity, barking dogs and all).  Perfect."
50,"Very nice place, very close to the beach. The service was really nice, thanks Adelina and Jose for making our stay been so good. Breakfast was amazing, love the food and fresh fruit. They spoil their clients!! A place for relax!"
50,"What an absolute hidden gem made even better by the warm hospitality of Adelina and her friendly team. The last stop for our honeymoon in Mexico was four days in Puerto Escondido and what a great choice of accommodation it was, we were truly spoilt!   We booked the master room which was spacious, light-filled, and crisp-clean. The place had a very cool design about it whilst keeping with a coastal Mexican feel.  The facilities at Quinta were perfect for what we needed. Each morning breakfast was prepared by Josefina as we sat around the outdoor kitchen chatting with other travellers, or just planning out the day by getting some local advice from Adelina about restaurants, activities, deep sea fishing trips or even get invited to release some baby turtles into the Pacific.    As"
40,"We just returned from a few days in Oaxaca City and Puerto. A very private place with exceptional service from host Adelina and cook/maid Josephina. Thanks Adelina for guiding us on restaurants and dropping us off at various places. Thanks Josephina for the delicious breakfasts, especially the fish tacos.  Please note that this area is still under development and there will be some light construction noise. We were also a little perturbed by the incessant barking from stray and neighbor's dogs but not sure you can escape that anywhere else. Would have liked the pool to have been cleaned a little more also."
50,We arrived in this charming place and we loved it.  Everyone is so nice! Nice litte swimming pool with cute flowers at the surface. Good size rooms. Delicious breakfast. Not far from the beach and good restaurants. We loved it and we'll be back for rest!!!
50,"We have just been to Mexico for 3 weeks and have stayed at Puebla, Oaxaca, Puerto Escondido, San Christobel, Pelenque and Mexico City. we stayed at some really nice places but they don't get 5 stars from me as they simply didn't match amazing Quinta Lili. The place and the people consistently exceeded our expectations.  When we saw the penthouse suite we upgraded as soon as we could. Holy cow it is amazing Hundertwasser eat your heart out. Basically we felt like rock stars with our own private jacuzzi on the third floor and a viewing deck on the upper part of the room with vistas of the Pacific.  But what really told was the service. Adelina and her brother Luis designed and built the place from scratch, pouring both heart and mind into the place and creating a home not a mere"
50,"My wife and I wanted to get some sun, eat some good food and stay in a nice place while we were visiting Puerto Escondido. That is exactly what we got staying at the Quintalili hotel. The Sunset room was nice, clean and you can sit on the balcony and see the ocean. The pool refreshing in the evening after coming back from the beach or dinner. The water pressure was good and the shower had a rain head which is always great!  The staff were SUPER helpful and they made our trip. I think with the recommendations we received that we ate at the best places in Puerto Escondido for local Oaxacan and Mexican food. We were able to see more of the true Puerto Escondido and not just the touristy spots. The beaches close to the hotel are great and the others are not too far away either. We"
50,"Quinta Lili is a beautiful little B&B and, on a tour through Mexico, it alone made Puerto Escondido my favorite place - hands down. In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, completely comfortable, and ideally located, the Quinta Lili is run by the most charming and accommodating owners and staff.  Over an exquisite breakfast, Adelina and Josefina took the time to chat with me about a wide array of topics, ranging from politics to economics to art & culture, to linguistics, etcetera, and etcetera.  Not only did I have an amazing stay, I also improved my awareness and understanding of Mexican civilization.  A thousand thanks to those at the Quinta Lili! I can’t wait to return!"
50,"if you're looking for a place to stay in puerto escondido look no further!  quinta lilli is beautiful, private and totally charming-- a treasure i won't forget when i return to puerto escondido.   thanks to adelina and josefina for the great food and service."
50,"We had wonderful stay at villa lili, the room with the private jacuzzi is fantastic. Our room was huge and the jacuzzi was in a separate attached big room. The location is not in the touristic center, but located near 2 nice beaches, where you can swim (no big waves). The touristic center with the surf beach is only a few minutes away, and the taxi there are really cheap.The staff is extremly helpful. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family."
50,"Villa Lili is a hidden gem in Puerto.  If you are looking for a beautiful boutique hotel, next to the most stunning beach, with yummy breakfast and amazing hospitality, Villa Lili is not to be missed!  Adelina is a lovely hostess and a new friend who did everything to make our stay enjoyable.  She suggested a temazcal steam bath and massage at Temazcalli which were incredible and highly recommended.  She will also recommend fun adventures and the best local spots for dining.  If you are looking for a romantic, delicious dinner, you must go to Pascale's.  We stayed in the Master Suite at the top of the villa and loved it.  The design and architecture is beautiful, the staff were just lovely and we will definitely go back!"
50,"The staff, the food, the rooms - everything was amazing! Adelina is the supreme hostess, with recommendations for where to go, what to eat, and what to do. And the food at breakfast was always made fresh with local ingredients and absolutely delicious. I'd recommend Villa Lili or Quinta Lili to anyone!"
50,"This is the same owners as Quinta Lili, just moments down the road.  All in all, sincerely it was one of the best accommodation experiences in all my travels.  The owner/manager was so incredibly welcoming and hospitable that I extended my stay and wished I could have extended it longer.  She was very willing to explain many things about Mexican culture and recommending fantastic places to eat and experience.  The rooms are all very unique, and the more pricier ones have an incredible architecture and detailing to them like I have not seen before.  The staff are so helpful, friendly and trustworthy and the complimentary breakfast is so plentiful and delicious.  I liked the location as it was only 10 minutes from a very beautiful beach that you can swim and a nice 15-20 minute"
50,"Stayed in the exotic suite and it was worth every dollar. We had a beautiful view of the pacific ocean. The jacuzzi and water fountain was a very nice touch and relaxing after a hot day at the beach. The service was wonderful everyone was friendly and always willing to help. The included breakfast was great, wasn´t a continental breakfast but real heated food. I would highly recommend this to anyone and I plan one day to come back such a great expierence!"
50,"Villa Lili is a really nice place, and we enjoyed our stay there so much! The house is beautiful and have a very nice and pool. The rooms are pretty, big, very clean and have comfortable beds. And the service is exceptional! Adelina was so nice and helpful. The breakfast was so enjoyable with fresh fuits, juice etc., and the special mexican dishes. I think this is one of the best places I have ever stayed!"
50,"We came to Puerto Escondido without knowing where to stay, then we stumbled upon Villa Lili by accident. The best accident ever! The place is great; big and comfy rooms, large and nice beds, hot water, a fairly large bathroom, it is clean and the service is excellent! And it just looks great and gives you a luxurious feel.  The service we got from Adelina was great, she seems to know everything there is to know about what to do and not to do in Puerto. And if you need to use the internet and didn't bring your laptop Adelina leaves her for everybody to use in the area by the pool. In case you brought your computer the place has Wi-fi.  And I have to mention the breakfast, what a joy! We got served fresh juice, yoghurt, fruit, granola, pancakes and a new mexican dish every day. It"
50,"Staying at the Villa Lili was definitely a highlight of my trip.  Ade and Claire really took care of us and planned spectacular outings for my friends and I.   The room was beautiful and clean.  The breakfast was always fabulous and a nice touch!  The Villa has a great pool and lounge area which is quiet and relaxing. When I visit Puerto Escondido again, I look forward to staying at the Villa!!    Thank you for making our stay in Puerto Escondido so magical!!! Nathalie & the girls from Canada:)"
50,"Adelina was very helpful. We really enjoyed our stay.  Clean, friendly with great breakfasts. Would highly recommend."
50,"I never expect much from hotels and B&Bs when I travel.  A good bed, a quiet room.  Maybe a decent view and okay food.  But Villa Lili has raised the bar for me.  First off, the location is excellent. Close to the bay and near great restaurants, yet close enough to Zipolte if you want to hang out in a busier part of town.  The rooms were really nice and clean and the bed was the most comfortable I've slept on in a long time.  Our room had a balcony with views of the water and their was a refreshing breeze in the room all day and night.  The staff, however, is what makes this place the best.  Adelina and her family made us feel welcome, gave us advice on restaurants and stuff to do (and what to avoid) The breakfasts were soooooo good (and plentiful)  and whenever we had questions"
50,"Well, what to say? All the reviews are right - Quinta Lili is a complete gem of a place. I hummed and haaahed before booking it, was I making a mistake not staying at Playa Zicatella, was I making a mistake staying somewhere so small when I am travelling alone. WOuld I be lonely? The answer to all these questions is a firm NO!!!   So far as the room was concerned, because of an overdemand for one of the first floor rooms which I had booked and because they would have to move me for my final night they moved me to the master suite for my whole stay. It was a great room, very large with an amazingly comfortable bed and screened windows across a whole corner of the building so you had great views. It was very clean.   Looking at the first floor rooms I would say that (apart from"
50,So glad I took the side trip from Oaxaca City to Puerto Escondido!   Quinta Lili is a charming place to relax and enjoy the local beaches.  Thank you Adelina and Josephina for making my stay an experience to remember.
50,We have been to many places around the world but we haven't experienced such a great hospitality like in Q.L. Josefina and Adelina did everything to make our trip memorable. The food they serve is fantastic and the rooms are tidy as my home.  Thank you guys! Suzy and Zoli
50,"We stayed three nights at Quinta Lili and really enjoyed our stay very much. The property was located just a mile or so from the main drag of downtown PE (a couple minute drive or a twenty minute walk or so) in a pleasantly quiet neighborhood but close to an area of restaurants/stores for convenience. It is also only ten minutes walking from Playa Carrazillo, which was a very nice swimming beach. The hotel was new, clean, and nicely laid out. The pool area and common space was comfortable and very clean. We stayed in one of the smaller rooms on the ground floor (that was the only one available) but it was more than adequate. The room was clean, had a nice bathroom, and a fridge. No AC but plenty of windows and a great ceiling fan so we slept comfortably each night. The larger"
50,"I could go on about the facilities (excellent), the location (perfect) , the value, the beaches and the town, but what sets Quinta Lili apart from others are the people. Adelina, Luis, and Josefina were outstanding. Like others have said, they make you feel part of the family. They are warm and welcoming and completely helpful. Any advice or help you need, they are their for you. Their advice for activities, places to eat, and other needs were all perfect. They went above and beyond for my wife when she was trying to do some urgent things for work and ran into technical difficulties. They helped her, and beyond what anyone would expect. And to top it all off, Josefina was so good to our boys, I was worried when we left, that our 12 year old might opt to stay with her instead of"
50,"I stayed at Quinta Lili for 8 days at the end of February. The room was clean and comfortable. There was a nice view of the ocean and some really fancy homes.   Each day started with breakfast cooked by Josefina at the breakfast bar. She made something different each day, including tacos, huevos rancheros, huevos divorciadas and pancakes. I'm vegetarian and she was happy to accommodate me. Eating at the breakfast bar was a good opportunity to meet the other guests, and also to speak to the owner, Adelina. Adelina helped arrange all our excursions. On her recommendation, we went to see the dolphins, the phosphorescent lagoon and took a surfing lesson.   Fron Quinta Lili, it is a short walk to Playa Carazillio. There are a ton of stairs to get down to the beach, but I didn't mind"
50,"Stayed there just around NYE, absolutely fantastic people who run it! The best mexican breakfast, made fresh to one and each of us around the kitchen table, beautiful rooms, warm people! They give you all the help and all the tips you need to enjoy the coastline around Puerto E. Culture, nature, traveling, guided trips- they know it all.  Would though not recommend it if you are young friends going for the ""party in Mexico"" style. It´s intimate, quiet and cozy. Not spring break material.  They make you feel like a part of the Quinta Lili family at once:)"
50,"My wife and I diverged from our usual action-packed vacation itineraries to go to somewhere relaxing 10 months after our first child was born. We picked Puerto Escondido because it seemed less of a typical tourist destination than Huatulco while still providing lots of options for food and entertainment. We chose Quinta Lili because of all the great reviews and their minimalist decor appealed to us. We were absolutely right on both counts. We felt like tourists, but not targets and our penthouse room with jacuzzi was incredible.  The fresh, cooked breakfasts every morning were a great introduction to some regional Mexican dishes, prepared with love by J. every morning. Enfrijoladas and tinga de pollo were our favorites! We spent most of our time relaxing in and around the"
50,"We really enjoyed our stay in this place. The arrea is beautiful and the room was nicely arranged. Nice breakfast. Very friendly staff, very helpful. When we needed small screwdriver and they did not have pne they took us to the shop that sold it. It's nice, quite arrea, the taxis are really cheap in Puerto Escondido so it was not a problem that it was a bit long walk to the main beach. Our favoriout thing was how the villa looked at night with nice light and great chill out music."
50,"We arrived to puerto escondido after a crazy bus ride over the mountains from Oaxaca city. Our nerves were rattled from the loud bus radio and juggling for six hours and then our host picked us up and we walked into the tranquil Quinta Lili with soft music and we just felt immediately at ease. Our room was lovely, the homemade breakfasts were delicious and the beach at carrizalillo was nice. The food at cafecito was good as well as la torre. Our host was wonderful - she was there every morning to help us with questions. With just five rooms you really got to know the other guests. We met a nice man from Norway, a fun couple from Germany, a guy from Australia, and two women from the states. My husband surfed at carrizalillo beach, we took a wonderful boat trip thru manialtepic"
50,"It was a perfect time!! The best hotel we ever had!! Very nice people, amazing mexican breakfast and a great master suite!! 100% realxing time!! Just wonderful...unbelievable... I recommend this hotel to EVERYBODY!! Really like in paradies- next to amazing beaches and everthing you need. Great hospitality!! You have to go there :)) We will come back- for sure!! It was our greatest hotel-experience!!"
50,"Adelina immediately made us feel comfortable, even though we did not have reservations! She invited us for breakfast as we arrived from Oaxaca city by AeroVega (please research before you EVER take this flight!!!) at 10:30 am.  The most memorable part of our stay was the breakfast cooks teaching me how to make 5 different Mexican Salsas! I had purchased some dried peppers at the market, but i didn't know how to make their wonderful salsa's. Even though we had a language barrier, it did not stop them from showing me: red Salsa, salsa verde (green tomato salsa), pico de Gallo, and 2 other salsas. I made our sons a mexican dinner when we returned, and everyone loved the 5 varieties of salsa!! Thank you ladies.  We stayed on the 4th floor master suite and it was so amazing. 1. the"
50,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at Villa Lili for 5 nights. Since it was during easter and we was late to book in advance we had to switch rooms three times, wherefore I can asure you that their rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. The atmosphere was fantastic and very relaxing. Best of all was the service. Adelina was extremely helpfull and her english is superb. Every morning they served European style breakfeast (fruit, yoghurt and cereals). They also served a new mexican dish each morning we were there, which was great for us since we really wanted to explore the mexican kitchen.  The location was a bit of from ""city"" but five minute walk from a really nice beach.  If I go back to Puerto Escondido I will definately stay at Vila Lili again. Best  Johanna"
50,"Absolutely loved Villa Lili.  All the staff there are incredibly friendly and made us feel right at home.  Beautiful little place with unique homely rooms.  The staff were so helpful with local information and helping us to arrange trips.  Already missing those amazing breakfasts by the pool, can't wait to go back."
50,"For peace, great food, perfect location and service, this must be one of the best places on the planet.  We spent 10 days in Puerto. The room was super, were cleaned every day and spacious, clever use of space with the TV and iPod-radio. Free wifi in the villa was very convenient. The villa with an amazing swimming pool is just gorgeous!  The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. Breakfast is to die for! Don’t miss the daily  Mexican dish. You will love it. The hotel is really well situated only a short walk from the best beaches in Puerto Escondido for swimming, learning to surf and snorkeling. (Playa Carrizalillo, Coral, Bacocho)  But for 20/30 pesos the taxi will drive you anywhere around. (Zicatela, El Adoquín and La Punta). The sea was beautiful and clear and just so warm."
50,"I stayed two days at Villa Lili at the end of my three-week vacation in Puerto Escondido. This new hotel is neat, clean, and shiny. Its architecture and layout is very original and my single room was cozy and super clean! Another think I loved there was the spacious yard with a nice long pool under palapa-roof, a big deck, and a kitchen. The local stile breakfasts were delicious making a good start for the day. The location of Villa Lili makes it self sufficient since it is just a short walking distance from my favorite Carizalillo Beach and from the restaurants and the stores in the area. The town is also nearby, but it’s not too close to disturb its peace and quiet. Special thanks to Adelina, the Villa Lili hostess! In addition to running the hotel in such a great shape, she"
50,"My husband and I stayed at Villa Lili for 3 nights and we really found a very nice place to relax. The atmosphere, service and breakfast (which is included) were excellent. Adelina (the owner) and her staff are fantastic and kindly oriented us to the top places like restaurants, beaches, lagoon, etc. In Villa Lili we felt like in our own home since it is a small boutique hotel  with 7 or 8 rooms. Nearby there is a street with nice coffee shops, small restaurants and a store to buy groceries. The two main beaches are about 10 min. walking distance from the hotel so you will not be exactely at the beach. There is a good reason for that. The beaches of Puerto Escondido are protected and you will not find any big hotel complexes right next to the beach like in Cancun or Acapulco. We"
50,"We stayed at Villa Lilli as part of a longer trip through Mexico - we had planned to only stay in Puerto Escondido for a couple of nights, but quickly extended that when we saw Villa Lili!  It was far and away the best place we stayed in Mexico, our room (one of the Master suites) was huge, with a gorgeous hot-tub and the whole place was spotless, but Adelina and her excellent team really made our stay - they were endlessly helpfull."
50,"Villa Lili, a place that attracts and astonishes for its warmth and simplicity. Away from the convention, Villa Lili is a concept for those who, as me, are seeking a place for rest and relaxation. The magic is within the details.  With just nine rooms, Villa Lili has creative and innovative facilities, which are suited to the climate and are environment-friendly. Along with easy listening music, indirect lighting, and comfortable lounge chairs and couches, common areas create a homey atmosphere, properly for enjoying a tasty breakfast in the morning, an afternoon at the pool or a bedtime reading. With an impeccable maintenance, the rooms are spacious with comfortable beds and details that give each a distinctive personality.  Its location is very suitable. Located within one of"
50,"We just returned from a three week stay in Mexico.  We flew into Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa and made our way to Puerto Escondido by bus.  We had no accomodation booked when we arrived and had planned to stay for a ""few days"" before making our way south to Huatulco.    That all changed when we discovered Villa Lili.  Adelina took us to see Villa Lili because there was no room at Quinta Lili (which we also loved) and it was, quite frankly, like stepping into an oasis.  The hotel itself is beautiful, the yard is stunning, tranquil music playing in the background.....this was it for us.  We ended up staying nine nights...and here's why:  Yard: there is a lap pool, yoga mats, area for sun, area for shade, communal kitchen area and Adelina's impressive orchid garden.  Rooms:  we were lucky"
50,"I could rave about the lovely master suite, views of the ocean, and tasty breakfasts at Quinta Lili, but what made our stay the most special was the warm hospitality of Adelina and Josephina throughout our stay. They did their best to make us feel welcome and at home. The location is wonderful; five minute walk to the beach and restaurants and shops close by and in walking distance. We can't wait to go back!!! Mark & Michael"
50,"Me encanta este lugar...what more can I say.  I stayed here in March for my birthday and had a perfect time. The grounds, and the rooms are perfect. Very new and excelantly maintained. Beautiful tile work throughout, I especially love the blue and yellow tiled walls in the bathroom, shower, and Jacuzzi, in the room we stayed in. It was wonderful to sit in the Jacuzzi, drink cocktails, and watch the sun go down. Perfect! The room was very nice, with a huge bed. Love-it! They had recently added a loft with two-chaise lounges. This is the perfect place to sit back and look at the view of the ocean. Wonderful place to relax.  The location is just down the path to the steps that take you down to Playa Carrizillo. This is a very secluded little playa. Perfect for drinking cervezas,"
50,"I did a rather elaborate amount of research before our trip to Puerto Escondido it was my boyfriends bday & this place is his favorite location for relaxation and tranquility. So I wanted to make this trip memorable for him as it was a milestone birthday and also my first time to visit Oaxaca.   All the glowing reviews of Quinta Lili are sincere and correct. Adelina and Josefina are wonderful people... very kind, giving and care about your stay at Quinta Lili. My career in the hospitality industry started out in hotels so I am particular when it comes to what is worth the money. This location is just steps away from the stairs that lead you down to Playa Carrizillo (very beautiful and secluded beach in Puerto Escondido) not one of the largest beaches but offers gorgeous peaceful"
50,"Contact to have a trip to see whales and turtles, go to visit to the handcrafts store and the market in downtown, also you can´t loose Carrizalillo and Zicaleta Beachs."
50,"Adelina, Luis, and Josefina make you feel welcome and at home from the moment you arrive and before.  Josefina keeps the whole place sparkling and clean. The rooms are comfortable. We had the ""sunset"" room which had a balcony. Quinta Lili is a five minute walk to Carrizalillo Beach which is safe and protected for swimming. Breakfasts were delicious and plentiful--Josefina is a wonderful cook and her smile sets the morning right. Adelina will help to set up excursions--she arranged a great bird-watching tour of the Manialtepec lagoon with Lalo Ecotours. Adelina and her brother threw a birthday dinner party for a guest to which all were invited. Lifts to town, advice on where to buy gifts, rides to and from the airport--they take care of the details so guests can relax."
50,"Even though the pictures of Quinta Lili, at shown on the web-pages looks astonishing, they cant give you the full impression of the ambience and the tranquility that embracess this really wonderfull place. You have to be there - and I´m sure you will love it, just like we did, during our one week stay in February 2011. The beach is only a short walk away, and there is a lot of resturants ind the area, and they are all open untill late in the evening, which is good, becauce after eating the wonderfull breakfast at Quinta Lily you won´t be hungry for a long time.  Michael Ertmann"
50,The hospitality of the owner and all the people who are working there is amazing.  Rooms are nice and clean.  The hotel is in a quiet area and very close to the beach.  We had a wonderful time there and we just want to back there!
50,"I've stayed at Quinta Lili twice now, and I would recommend everyone who goes to lovely Puerto Escondido to go there. It's a beautiful little hotel situated just next to one of the best beaches in the coastline - Carrizalillo - a calm, palmy bay that offers you calm waters, where you can swin and play all day - go on a boattrip or take surfinglessons. The breakfast is authentic mexican food served in the outdoor kitchen with a personal and smiling service by the lovely people that you will get to know, when you visit. This is not an ordinary hotel - it's just like visiting friends and you simply feel at home at this hidden little diamond."
50,"Adelina - so beautiful as this name and the person behind the name was our time in ""Quinta Lili"". Adelina and her brother Luis took personal time for counselling, giving us tips, discussed our experiences and more. They and the friendly housemaid Josephina took really good care. And the house: not luxury in every detail, but with a great charme. Only 5 rooms, so that you don´t feel like in a big hotel, that you come at the end of the day ""at home"". Big breakfast in different styles so as you like, 5 minutes to the next wonderfull beach and much more quiet as the most other places in mexico. We like to come again to this place. Thank you for Marlen Heinrich from ""Mexiko Mio"" for this tip."
50,"We really enjoyed our three nights at Quinta Lili. The staff is extremely warm and helpful, the place is spotlessly clean, the beds are some of the best we've experienced in Mexico. There's a nice courtyard with a palapa and swimming pool and a breakfast bar. It's on the far north end of Puerto Escondido, not on the beach, but about 10 minutes from the little gem known as Playa Carrizalillo. (Note that you have to walk down a 100-step-plus stairway to get there. There are other PE beaches a short cab ride away.) We got complimentary airport transfers as well, and the owner took me to the medical clinic when I got a touch of food poisoning. Be aware that Quinta Lili is not air conditioned, and the neighborhood, while safe, is very dark at night: I wished I'd had a flashlight."
50,"We stayed two night at Villa Lili as part of a long trip through Mexico. It had large and meticulously clean rooms and the proprietor Adelina was very helpful and friendly, and speaks English very well. Two ladies take care of the cleaning, and of cooking breakfast in the morning. The breakfast was excellent! First there is a traditional hotel breakfast of fruit, bread and cereal, but this is only the starter before a delicious Mexican breakfast that was different every day. I am a vegetarian, and this was no problem, and the vegetarian food was great. I can very much recommend Villa Lili!"
50,"Villa Lili is situated just a 5 minute walk from a nice and calm beach in Puerto Escondido. It is a lovely place with very friendly staff. The owner (Adelina) is making you feel “at home”. When you arrive she tells you all about the places to see, where to eat the best food (and we tried them all!) and what Puerto Escondido has to offer. We simply loved the surfing and releasing baby turtles into the sea (where Adelina took us). Isidra and Josefine (the cleaning and breakfast ladies) are very nice and friendly as well, and they prepare a great breakfast every morning! There’s fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereals and a Mexican special (different every day!).  There are different rooms at Vila Lili. We loved the one that we stayed in. It is big and spacious, which is why we think that"
50,"First of all I have to claim that me and my girlfriend were the first ones to make a baby during our stay. That was about 2 weeks after the opening.  We're of course very happy now and thankful for that surprise present we took home from vacation. The atmosphere was very familiar in Quinta Lili. Adelina was training the new service team very well and therefore we had a very comfortable stay. The mexican style breakfast is included in the price and served with fresh juice and tasty coffee. If there was something we didn't like (e.g. my girlfriend doesn't like fish) we were offered alternatives.   Adelina had useful tips for trips, dining and surfing.  In the rating I gave 4 points ""only"" for cleanliness, service, and location. This does not mean ""it's not clean in Quinta Lili""."
50,"After a pretty flight over the mountains from Oaxaca my husband, daughter and I were met at the airport and whisked to Villa Lilli in about 10 minutes. Upon arrival we were immediately greeted  by Adelina (owner), shown our spotless rooms and given an orientation map and preview of dining spots and activities in the area. Then we sat down in an immaculate outdoor kitchen where we had a wonderful breakfast of freshly squeezed orange juice,cereals, yogurt and local fruits. This was followed by a hot Mexican specialty. (which changed every day).  The serenity and peace of the villa made our stay very restful and yet we were able to enjoy all the beach activities close at hand, including the release of the turtles.  When Adelina drove us to the airport for our early morning flight"
50,"Vila Lilli is an experince you should not miss!! If you want to relaze in familiar surroundings, this is the place! We stayed there for 4 days and 3 nights and I have never stayed a place so familiar and with so friendly people before. The owner of the Hotel are really helpsome with everything and the staff are also very friendly and they will make delicous mexican breakfast for all in the hotel every morning. Do not miss this experience!!"
50,"as a solo traveler from miles away from my own family, I felt as though I had come home to my other family! Edalina accepts you into her arms and home the minute you arrive. The lovely spacious rooms ( I had a look at all there very nice!) I stayed in the ""TREEHOUSE"" ( Nicknamed by me!) with a 200 degree view of the ocean and a giant oversized kingsized bed, blue lights accenting the beauty of the room and the architecture is amazing! The ladies become sisters,friends and moms in the morning as they adorn you with the biggest smiles in the morning and the most delicious breakfasts ( mmmm potato papas!) The beach is minutes away and the stairs are highly overated as hard because Im a big ol farm boy and had no problem at all with them! then come back home to villa lili and cool"
50,"This is a  brand new hotel where I stayed for four nights at 40.00 dollars per night. I got  a complimentary ride from the bus station which was very helpful and was given a large airy room with a t.v. and and a beautiful balcony. The woman who runs the hotel, Ade, was very  warm and accomadating. This hotel is near the best  swimming beach in Puerto Escondido and is totally worth the money  so treat  yourself  an d stay at the Villa  Lili!"
50,"We were so happy to find such a nice hotel as Villa Lilly. We enjoyed our stay of 18 days  in this great and clean hotel with artistry and ambiance. The rooms were comfortable and clean the swimming pool was cleaned every day and enjoyed very much, and in the evenings the lights were perfect, Onyx lamps, stars lit up and small light around the pathways and pool. Adelina our hostess is a very intelligent lady, speaks perfect english and treated us like friends. She made sure to make our stay special. Every morning breakfast was prepared by 2 ladies, and in addition to cereal, fruit salad, yoghurt, fresh pressed orange juice, the main part of breakfast was a different Mexican specialty which we enjoyed very much. Adelina made sure we had a different wonderful breakfast every day."
50,"Villa Lili is an exceptional place to stay, being beautifully designed & lovingly cared for. The delicious, generous breakfasts that are prepared by attentive & friendly women are always a surprise. As well, the wonderful, welcoming, smart Adriana who manages the place superbly always makes herself available to be of assistance & to share her passion for this special place in an enchanting part of the world. Turtles, ocean, restaurants, birds & lagoon - there is so much on offer in the area. This place is a gem in modern Mexico that is innovative while retaining an emotional centre & keeping touch with rich, authentic traditions. It offers a tranquil environment where both the body & spirit can find nourishment & be refreshed. With careful, personal attention, a stay at Villa"
50,"Some time ago, we visited the Quinta Lili and we fall in love with the place, but this time we had the chance to stay in Villa Lila and I have to say, what a great place!. Rooms are very confortable and as always clean, just perfect for some relaxing days. Both places follows the same architecture and the service always good.Adelina and Luis always kept their eyes on us, thank you buddies for all the recommendations and for so nice experience with the baby turtles, our son loved it. We are just waiting for the next chance to go back to see you and stay with you."
50,"We did choose Quinta Lili based on all of the excellent reviews ....which all proved to be correct!  Having vacationed in Mexico on several occasions, we were pleasantly surprised with the landscape of coastal Oaxaca and the layed back charm of Puerto Escondido. Quinta Lili is located in a quiet suburb north of the main town. We walked every morning to town and found the place charming. There seems to be a good relationship between the tourists and the locals which does not always exist in other parts of Mexico. Taxis were cheap and readily available. The service at Quinta Lilli was excellent. Josephina prepared a great breakfast every morning and was very friendly and gracious. The Owners made sure you were comfortable and went out of their way to help you out with planning"
50,"I'll never stay in another place on the Oaxacan coast. Quinta Lili had superb service, a warm and inviting feel, and the best fish tacos I've ever tasted. Staying at Quinta Lili feels like you've just been invited into someone's immaculately maintained and decorated home who has exceptional taste in cool, hip, international friends. Loved every minute of it!"
50,"This hotel was the best I have ever stayed at. We arrived very early (8am) at the airport, and a taxi was waiting for us courtesy of the hotel. Our rooms weren't ready yet, but we were immediately offered coffee and breakfast while one of the owners sat down with us and marked a map with restaurants and places to explore, and even gave us his cell phone number in case we got lost.  Once we got into our rooms, we were immediately comfortable. We had 2 rooms, one king size bed with a balcony on the 2nd floor, and one with a queen and a twin that opened up onto the pool. All the beds were very comfortable, everything was spotless.  The hotel is in a very good location near the Rinconada. There is a mini-mart that sells snacks, soda, beer/wine/liquor, and has internet access just a"
50,"If you are looking for a small, intimate boutique-type hotel but don't want to pay the usual over-the-top boutique prices Quinta Lili is an excellent choice. It is located in a sort of suburb of P.E., which actually makes it very quiet, but is near a small,pretty beach attainable via a rather long flight of stairs. One great thing about P.E., however, is that taxis are extremely cheap -- about 20 to 30 pesos-- , and so it is easy to take one to any of the town's various other beaches if you are looking for variety.  The staff at the Quinta, including the owners, are around a lot, so if you have questions or need something they are usually always there to help out. I checked out about a dozen places before settling on this lovely little hotel and could not be happier with my"
50,"I stayed for 3 nights at Quinta Lili in June and I had an awesome time there !!!! The hotel is small house with 5 beautiful bedrooms with balconies looking over the swimming pool & jacuzzi. Rooms are very clean and beautifully furnished. Adelina, the host, is a charming person and she'll explain you everything you need to know about Puerto Escondido and its surroundings, especially if you like nature, flowers and birds.  Breakfasts are awesome, everything is cooked with fresh ingredient from the local market and simply delicious !!! In Quinta Lili you'll feel like being at home and you'll feel like coming back soon !!!!!!"
50,"I'd visited Puerto Escondido before and been less than impressed by the accommodation options. I booked Quinta Lili this time around based on the reviews on the site, and I'm happy to confirm that it lives up to all of the excellent reviews. Adelina was a wonderful host, and the quality and attention to detail in fitting out the rooms make for a very comfortable stay. The breakfast prepared by Josefina was delicious, and I really appreciated being offered breakfast the morning arrived, after a long overnight bus trip from Mexico City. Best of all, Quinta Lili is just a few minutes walk from Playa Carizalillo, one of the most beautiful beaches in Mexico, if not the world."
50,"Very nicely decorated hotel with small pool and excellent breakfast offers. Stayed in the top room and was great oasis of rest after a heavy biking trip. Place is close to the best beach of puerto escondido. But best part is the 2 people who own this nice hotel: Adelina is the sweetest hotel manager i ever encountered who took care of me when Montezuma struck my stomach. Paris Hilton: you're out, Adeline is in!  Just book and u won't regret it."
50,"I found this hotel at Tripadvisor, read all the raving reviews from former guests, looked at the photos of the hotel and the surroundings and immediately decided to go to Puerto Escondido for my Mexico vacation. It was everything I had hoped for- and more! Adelina (the owner and hotel manager) is so helpful and charming it´s unbelievable. And Josefina, who makes the delicious breakfast every morning and also takes care of all the cleaning of the hotel, is a wonderful person as well. Playa Carrizalillo is the best in Puerto Escondido (unless you´re a professional surfer). The only downside is the steep steps to get there- that is really hard on your lungs and heart if you´re not fit. (But if you´re healthy maybe climbing them will help make you fit by the end of your stay.) Lying"
50,"We had a great time at Quinta Lili!  Quinta Lili is truly a gem. The setting and the staff are great and welcoming. The facilities and the rooms are very clean, and in the mornings we were served breakfast and greated by the always smiling and cheerful Josefina, a great start to the day.   Quinta Lili is just steps away from Playa Carrizalillo, which we found to be the best beach in Puerto Escondido. From our room in Quinta Lili we had amazing views Playa Carrizalillo.    Adelina adds to the experience by being a great hostess. Her attention to detail personalizes your trip. We enjoyed our morning conversations, were she would give us tips for itineraries, day trips, or hidden spots known to locals – not only in Puerto Escondido, but also in Mexico. Adelina ensures you enjoy"
50,"I went to Puerto Escondido with my boyfriend and we are glad that we were able to book at the Quinta Lili.  We communicated with Luis beforehand through email and he was always very quick and responsive.  He helped set up a free airport transfer, which was a great little addition.  When we arrived we loved the hotel, it was beautiful and the staff was extremely welcoming, offering us breakfast while we waited for our room.  The room itself was very clean and roomy with a huge king sized bed.  Though the hotel is away from some of the main streets (just a 5 minute taxi ride away), it actually felt wonderful to come back to the hotel at the end of the day, it was very  serene and felt like a little paradise getaway.  At times no one else was there at the hotel, and we didn't have"
50,"Villa Lili is an extension of the Lili Family (Quinta Lili and Villa Lili). A very nice archtectured piece of vacation art. The rooms are incredibly roomy and clean.  The breakfast is making your day already, even more after having some nice long strokes in the pool.  The outstanding staff, always with a smile, is taking care whenever you want. Even if your wishes are a bit dreamy or unusual. At the end it is just to say it is a very loving and  idyllic place to stay in Puerto Escondido which I really recommend."
50,"the owner, Adelina, intelligent, talented and fluent in English,  will help you with everything. The staff are wonderful too. The breakfast that is included, is plentiful and very healthy,;  you won't need to eat till supper.!!!  The long pool is surrounded by  palms and bouganvillas,and  soft onyx lamps., and lovely mosaics everywhere. Soothing meditative music calms the stressed-out souls like us, arriving from Canada,USA and Europe. We abandoned the awful TowerBridge Hotel( and our deposit there), and stumbled upon  this jewel of a place quite by accident ( much closer to the beach too) For only a few dollars  more a day we found paradise !!!"
50,"On our way to Manzanillo, we flew to Puerto Escondido for a few days and immediately looked to Tripadvisor for a recommendation (we are never steered wrong by others' reviews.) Villa Lilli is fairly new and already was highly praised, and no wonder! It's a great little hideaway and its plain street exterior disguises the real gem within its secure walls (keyed entry). It's truly lovely, with a pool and common breakfast area adjoining a deck where one can sit, undisturbed by loud noise. Adelina, (part-owner), was the first to greet us, so friendly! and speaks English fluently (which helped as we are just learning Spanish.) We were in the Nemo suite-- a luxurious treat, with jacuzzi tub, and open ceiling adjoining the master bedroom.The housekeeping staff were extremely courteous"
50,"Me and my partner had a great time staying at this place. Adelina and Luis were very helpful, they gave us a map and some “tips” on things to do on our arrival. A healthy breakfast was served everyday and they accommodated our vegetarian diet. And the rooms were spacious and comfy. I would recommend you ask for a room with a balcony!"
50,"Thanks to Adelina and Louis for nine wonderful days in Villa Lili. Amazing and consistent architecture, you don't feel living in a hotel, you feel you have a house for yourself. Nice breakfast with a different Mexican main course every day. All rooms looks different, they are big and fresh, thorough cleaned every day, fantastic sunset view, close to different beaches, situated in a quiet and safe area. You really feel taken care of in a good way. This new and nice hotel is recommended to everyone. You will never find any more helpful and friendly host and hostess."
50,"We spent three nights at Villa Lili which is the brand new extension of Quinta Lili. The place is delightfull and the rooms are spacious and spotless, some have their own yacuzzi and there is a nice swimmimg pool and sitting area for the guests. The hotel is situated in a quiet residential area and most rooms have their own balcony with seaview.The staff went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant as possible. They serve an excellent breakfast with fruit and local specialities. What makes this place really special are the efforts of the owner to show you the interesting spots in Puerto Escondido. She took us personally and free of charge to the Salva Negra foundation for the protection of marine turtles so we could take part in the release of young baby turtles into the"
50,"I discovered Villa Lili while searching for a hotel in Puerto Escondido for the Christmas holidays. The reviews of Quinta Lili were terrific, but unfortunately the Quinta was all booked up. No worries, the owners told us, they were finishing their new hotel just up the road and it would be ready by December. We were making the trip with another family and my friend's email exchanges with Luis (who owns the hotel with his sister Adelina) gave us the confidence to reserve three rooms while they were still finishing up construction. It turned out to be one of the best leaps-of-faith we've made.  We arrived Christmas day and the hotel was beautiful. My wife and I had the top room which featured a great view down to lounge area, and had a shower that was open to the sky. Our friends"
50,"This was my second time in Puerto Escondido. I will definitely recommend this hotel to couples, families and peolpe travelling alone. Puerto Escondido its a relaxed place and perfect for surfing! The rooms in Villa Lili are nice  with beautiful ocean view. The mastersuites are perfect for couples, with jacuzzi, private balcony and stunning view. I have never felt so welcome when im coming to a hotel like I feel when arriving to Villa Lili. They did everything for making our vacation perfect. One thing i will miss is the breakfast! They make a different mexican dish every day, and without too much chili. Delicious! Im really looking forward to coming back!"
50,"My Husband and I spent a week with the amazing folks at Villa Lili, and we couldn't have been more pleased with our experience. The service was superb, from our first inquiries regarding reservations and booking to airport shuttles, recommendations, amazing breakfasts, and accommodations. Luis and Adelina are incredibly attentive, kind, and lovely people. We couldn't imagine spending our time and money anywhere else. Our only regret would be that we didn't stay longer!  If you are considering a trip to Puerto Escondido, I strongly encourage you to stay at either Villa Lili or Quinta Lili."
50,"Vila Lili was a wonderfull place. We got a transfer from the busstation, and arrived at the hotel. The atmosfaire was brilliant and relaxed. Located close to nice restaurants and minimarked. The beach was close and great. Very good breakfast and good service. A place we want to return to."
50,"Staying at Quinta Lili, is an outstanding experiences. The warmest hospitality it is incredible. This lovely place is very testful decorating as well as great maintenance and cleanest. Once that you get into this little paradise, you will want to stay much longer. The personal touch of Adelina and Luis is wonderful and makes you feel at home. Love Céline and Andrés"
50,"We spent 3 nights in this hotel with my boyfriend and were so happy to have chosen Quinta lili.. The reviews he had read on trip advisor before coming  were right.. Quinta Lili is a great hotel, very layed back and relaxed... Adelina is great, she gave us lots of good advice and was adorable and nice to chat to. We stayed in the bedroom at the last floor, with the jacuzzi outside on the roof, a view on the sea , very nicely assorted room, very romantic. We were extremely pleased and if we had to go back to puerto escondido one day (i hope!), you can be sure we would go back at Quinta Lili!!!! + the beach which is 5min walk away, is great, no too many peopole and the waves arent too big to swim...  All in all, i must say this trip in Puerto Escondido was GREAT, and partly thanks"
50,"We had an amazing time with Adelina and her staff at the Quinta Lilli. Her hospitality and service were unlike anything we experienced before and she truly made us feel at home. Adelina always had good tips and recommendations for things to do and she even took us to visit an iguana nursery in her own car.   Breakfast was absolutely delicious, with an assortment of fresh fruit, juices and local food.    The room was very clean, spacious and nicely furnished. The neighborhood was nice and quiet and it was located a couple of hundred meters from the most beautiful beach in Puerto Escondido. The price was also very reasonable.   We couldn't have asked for more. What a great vacation, I really miss this place."
50,"Definately recommend Quinta Lili if you are looking for a comfortable, clean, quiet and super pleasant place to stay and relax. Nice not to be in the crowds of the main beach but an easy taxi ride away if you want. The pool is such a great place to hang out by.  Restaurants, cafes, library, laundromat all within easy walking distance. Breakfasts are delicious and the staff are friendly and helpful. Adelina especially, she made our stay there really fun, she is very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Perfecto!!!"
50,"If you are looking for lovely boutique hotel close to one of the best surfing beaches in the world, then look no further.  Quinta Lili with its 5-bedrooms is run by Adelina, who doubles as the most helpful and knowledgeable tour guide you can imagine.  We spent 3 nights at Quinta Lili in June, when it rains in the afternoon, but this did not dampen our spirits.  The rooms are light and spacious, and spotlessly clean.  As we were 6, we had 3 rooms including the top floor room with its roof-top Jacuzzi and panoramic views.  It was worth the few dollars extra.  The price of the room includes a very nice breakfast, which is prepared freshly for you and always includes delicious fresh local fruit and a cooked dish, plus of course the usual breakfast cereals, etc.  A few minutes walk"
50,"Quinta Lili captures the heart and soul of Mexico!  If you are looking for the most quietly divine and serene place simply relax and breathe, this is the place for you!  Just a 5 minute walk to Playa Carrizalillo, one of the most beautiful and swimmable beaches in all of Puerto.  This is an absolute gem.   Each room has its unique touch/decoration and is immaculate-simply beautiful.   Adelina is the most gracious, caring, and warm hostess; she and her entire staff are reminiscent of days of long ago in which the emphasis is placed on the actual individual and his/her comfort as opposed to simply making money.  No words will adequately describe our entire experience here… Absolutely sublime!"
50,Quinta Lili is a beautiful little b&b in a quiet upmarket residential area. The location is perfect if you want to be away from the party at the main beach but within easy reach as it's a super easy cheap taxi to the life of the main beach if you want. Easy walk down the road (and steps) to Playa Carazallio a good swimming beach. There are a couple of great restaurants and cafes 2min walk away - not heaps but enough to keep you happy. Our room was spotless and the beds comfy. The pool a welcome relief from the heat. Breakfast was great. But was really makes Quinta Lili so brilliant are the people who run it and work there. Outstanding! Thank you Quinta Lili we will be back!!
50,"Upon arrival there was transport at the airport and early check-in with breakfast.  Adelina was super hospitable and offered a ton of information about the area, including rides, tour arrangements and sharing the hots spots to eat at.  It is tucked just off the main drag, it is quiet and close to the beach...it is a hike up and down the stone stairway.  If you are choosing - choose Quinta Lili if not for the place do it for the people."
50,"After a short email conversation with the lovely owner of the Hotel, everything was arranged to pick me up at the airport. Arriving in the afternoon after a long trip from San Cristobal, my room was ready and I could rest and enjoy the swimming pool straight away. The week I had spent there was everything I needed. Adelina, the fabulous host, provided me all the tips I was looking for to make my stay easier.  Breakfasts were delicious and everyday different. All the staff is friendly, caring and did their best to understand my basic Spanish. To summarize, I found my Home in Paradise in this beautiful, friendly and relaxing hotel. I will be back as soon as I can to spend time with my new friends from Puerto Escondido. All the best for the future Adelina."
50,"We got our first taste of the owner's hospitality and energy the moment we arrived at about 4:30 PM. As soon as Adelina had greeted us and helped us settle in she said that if we were interested in volunteering to help release some newly-hatched turtles, and could be ready to leave at 6:30, we could go to a site operated by the Selva Negra Foundation (www.selvanegra.org.mx) and assist in this project.   So we went to a nearby restaurant (El Cafecito - excellent), had a quick dinner and walked back to the hotel where Adelina picked us up in her van and whisked us to a beach about 20 minutes from the hotel. Releasing these endangered turtles was a wonderful experience, as well as a great introduction to Puerto Escondido.  The next morning - and every morning of our stay -"
50,"We spent a week in Villa Lili with our two kids (ages 13 and 9) along with another family with kids.  It's a beautiful building with lovely rooms, many of which have superb views of the Pacific Ocean.  The decor is quite funky and it's fun just to be at the hotel.  It has a nice pool in the center and a lot of the guests hang around together at the pool.  It's about a ten minute walk to a nice protected beach and a short taxi ride to other beaches.  You can also walk or take a taxi to stores/restaurants etc.  While it's a great hotel in a great location, by far the best thing about it is the proprietors, Luis and Adelina.  They are extremely nice, intelligent, energetic, helpful and patient.  Finally, the price was quite a bargain.  My family and I look forward to going back."
50,"If you look for a cosy place that has soul, la Villa is for you. The owners do all they can to make you confortable. The rooms are cleaned every day. The architecture and design of the place is amazing. It is near to beach Carizalillo, a small beach perfect for relaxation and eating fresh just-picked oysters. I had a wonderful time there and cannot wait to go back."
50,"Quinta lili is one of the most beautiful hotels my husband and I have ever seen. It is extremely clean and only a short walk to the beach. Adelina is an amazing host and she always comes up with fantastic ideas for things to do. While we were there she took us bird watching, to an iguana and a crocodile reserve, and we had the rare treat of seeing bioluminescence in the mangrove. The breakfasts are great and all the staff are super friendly. I really can't say enough about this place, if you go to puerto Escondido you really should stay there."
50,"This March I was staying in Quinta Lili with my wife in the second time. Now we booked a master bedroom on the top floor that is nicely placed under palapa roof providing good view of the ocean and surrounding area. We arrived at Puerto Airport and were nicely surprised by a taxi driver holding a sign with my last name. The Quinta Lili hostess, Adelina arranged us a ride as one of many other gestures of her hospitality!  Needless to say, Quinta Lili is held in good shape - neat, cosy and quiet, great breakfasts; however, its friendly and home like environment attracts us the most!"
50,I was very nervous traveling to the Pacific coast for the first time. I had no idea what to expect from a hotel chosen purely via a random search. I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at Quinta Lili. The design of the place is striking and it's so cozy. The rooms are clean and quiet. Adelina is super awesome and exceedingly helpful. She can give you advice on any activity you can imagine from releasing baby turtles to where to catch the epic sunset. The continental breakfast also includes Oaxacan  specialties and is not to be missed. I can't wait to return. It really was like staying with friends.
50,"We went to Puerto Escondido in mid May and stayed at Quinta Lili.  We showed up at Quinta Lili's door without a reservation.  Yet, as luck would have it, the owner of the home happened to arrive at the door at the same exact moment!    The only room available when we arrived was the master suite on the top floor, which was a little more pricey than we were looking for but since we were there in the low season the owner was willing to negotiate price.  It was well worth the cost.  The room had a king sized bed with mosquito net, mini fridge, satellite TV, DVD player, secure safe, ceiling fan (no air conditioning), lots of windows and great views.  The private, rooftop (outdoor) bathroom had a stand-up shower and jacuzzi.  Quinta Lili also gave guests access to the kitchen but"
50,"I turned up at Quinta Lili in my third month of travelling around South and Central America, exhausted and drained from a rather trying experience in Santa Elena (Venezuela) I had lost my spark and was considering going home. Within one day of being there, this changed completely!  I can not recommend this place highly enough; Adelina and Josephina (as well as Josephina's colleague who I'm ashamed to say I've forgotten the name of) were perfect hosts going above and beyond the call of duty throughout my stay. Within the first few weeks of my stay (I ended up staying a month), Adelina had generously invited me to help turtles back into the wild (amazing!!!!), lent me her laptop for personal use, driven me to desired destinations, organised boating trips AND put on the most"
50,"I arrived at Quinta Lili to meet a friend who was already staying there.  When I arrived it was not only great to see my friend, but to have such a friendly and warm welcome after a day of flights.  It felt like I was joining an extended group of friends.  Everyone goes out of their way to make sure that you are looked after during your stay and nothing is too much trouble for Adelina to organise for you, from sunrise trips to see dolphins, great restaurants etc to conservation projects.  I travel a lot for work and never bother with breakfasts in hotels, but I got up every morning for the gorgeous breakfasts out by the pool ... and getting me out of bed is no mean feat!!  I would definitely go back if I was lucky enough to return to Puerto Escondido and have already told"
50,"We stayed for 4 nights and could have stayed so much longer. The room was perfect and location on the most beautiful beach in the whole of Puerto Escondido. The breakfasts were everything that you could ask for - kept us full until dinnertime! It really is perfect, we don't find staying in large corporate run hotels very relaxing, here you get all the attention of being in a small boutique family run hotel with all the little luxuries you would expect and a wealth of local knowledge from the hosts."
50,"This is my second stay at Quinta Lili, and I cannot speak more highly of this hotel and the management. You dont feel like just a guest at Quinta Lili (or Villa Lili the sister hotel) but rather a friend. The rooms are comfortably and tastefully furnished. The breakfasts are AMAZING, the design and layout of both hotels are fantastic and the tranquillity of the area and hotel is wonderful. The first time I stayed, I planned on only staying 2 nights, but stayed a week. My second time, I planned to stay 3 nights, and stayed 8. Adelina is a wonderful host and goes out of her way to ensure you have a pleasant, relaxing, eventful stay. Whatever you wish, she will do her best to accomodate. She always has fantastic advice for activites, restaurants etc, and will always have the time"
50,"My wife and I stayed at Quinta Lili for 18 days in December '09 through January '10.  It was our honeymoon and we were looking for a unique, warm, and personal experience during our trip to Puerto Escondido.  From the very first correspondence, our highest of expectations were exceeded by Luis and Adelina.  This brother-sister duo create the most incredible, relaxing, and warm environment for the guests at Quinta Lili and they went even further above and beyond to make our honeymoon special.  Luis and Adelina took it upon themselves to ensure that we could want for nothing during our stay, yet they managed to do so without imposing on our plans in the slightest.  Adelina looks after her guests as a loving mother would her children.  She has the brightest smile in all of Puerto"
50,"Once again, our trip to Puerto Escondido was PERFECT.  This was our 2nd visit and stay at Quinta Lili.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Puerto Escondido.  Adelina is the most outstanding hostess!!  From the rides she gave us to the beach, to the pesos she borrowed us when we first arrived, to the party at the end of the week.  Todo Bien!!!  Breakfast everyday was amazing and the rooms are very clean and private.  The neighborhood is very nice and within walking distance to nice shops, cafe's and stores.  See you next year Adelina!!  MUCHAS GRACIAS!"
50,"We arrived in the morning by taxi from the airport to find that Adelina was paying for our taxi and already had breakfast ready for us. Adelina is a great hostess, giving lots of tips to enjoy Puerto Escondido and even ferrying us around in her car when she could. I'll go back for a longer stay next time, there is a world of difference between the service at a small B&B like Quinta Lili and the big chain hotels I usually stay at on business trips! And the communal fridge with all the left-over booze is a plus!"
50,"We came to Puerto for surfing, and fell in love with the place! We stayed at Quinta L for over 1 week. Adelina and Luis made sure that we were MORE than comfortable. The place was clean and very quiet. Our room was on the ground floor on the right when you enter the facility. Although it was very hot and humid (apparently not nearly in the heat of the summer!), the ceiling fan definitely helped. After a few days, you will easily relax here and acclimate to the weather. The continental breakfast was very nice, and Rosa made us local favorites in addition to yogurt and fruit. El Cafecito was a short walk down the street, and had free wireless with the purchase of a drink or food.   If you are looking to party and be loud, stay near La Punta or Zicatela. If you are looking for"
50,"I stayed for 4 nights , April 19-23 and had a wonderful time here.  Adelina, the manager and Josephina  went out of their away to make our stay very enjoyable and relaxing. The penthouse has great views looking out towards Carazilillo Beach.  A very well designed, comfortable  property with an excellent , really unique pool divided by a bridge. Great details and features. Delicious breakfasts............Jacuzzi on top, wonderful deck and overall excellent+"
50,"Exceeded my expectations by a considerable margin - extremely clean, friendly owner, wonderful service, very quiet, soothing, exquisite exterior and interior design is a delight to the eye.  Small but beautiful pool, picturesque.  Delicious breakfast.  Hot and cold water, refrigerator in room.  Very comfortable bed.  The owner-designer just finished another inn nearby, Villa Lili, has much larger pool, is a larger overall.  Located near the most  beautiful cove/beach in Puerto Escondido.  Located near shops, very fine restaurant on Benito Juarez Bvd."
50,"Quinta Lili is a wonderful place to stay if you are looking for a relaxing, cozy, and exclusive place. All amenities included, but not losing the unique Mexican atmosphere, and the culinary taste of Oaxaca and Puerto Escondido. Highly recommended for travelers from Mexico and from Overseas. Great hosts!"
50,"Quinta Lili is a quiet and comfortable hotel. My husband and I felt very relaxed and safe tucked within its courtyard walls. We stayed in the King with balcony on the middle floor. The room is designed for maximum airflow and has lots of natural light all day but without ever having the sun directly in your eyes. Bright yet cool.  What makes Quinta Lili a wonderful hotel are Adelina and Rosa. Adelina is a very kind and warm person and a wonderful hostess. She provided all sorts of suggestions for activities and restaurants and helped us set up appointments. Rosa is friendly and sweet. She prepared us the best breakfast every morning - yummy sopes, fish tacos, enchiladas. There was always a bowl of fresh fruit, fresh squeezed oj, and coffee or tea to start off. It's a great value"
50,"I spent 2 nights at Quinta Lili with a friend and we were both very happy. The house is amazing, the staff really friendly. Everything was perfect."
50,"Quinta Lili was perfect as a home base for a beach getaway in Puerto Escondido.  Located right between Playa Bacocho (long, beautiful, sparse beach but w/dangerous waves) and Playa Carrizallio (the best beach in Puerto Escondido - great swimming!).  It's only a short, 30 peso cab ride from the center of town, but there are some nice restaurants nearby as well.  The hotel itself is lovely.  It has just a few rooms.  Ours was basic but very clean and well-maintained with ample space.  Satellite TV and radio was a nice feature for chilling out in the evenings.  They also have a beautiful, small pool which was great for cooling off after a long day at the beach.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  Each morning, they cook a delicious breakfast, and I really enjoyed"
50,To put it simple I didn't want to write a review because I don't want everybody to know about it so when I want to go again I can find a room! I can't believe something like Quinta Lili even exsist in this time and age. It's very quite and relaxing at least in April when I was there. Adelina was so helpful in finding stuff to do and nice places to eat. They made a real nice freash breakfast every morning with all local freash fruit and I always came back from the beach to find my room cleaned and with fresh linen and clean towels. I will come beack here every time I go to Mexico I just wish they had a place every where I wanted to go so I could always stay with them!
50,Quinta Lili and Puerto Escondido was the perfect stay for me before going on a business trip to Tucson Az. Adelina was a perfect host and made me feel welcome to Puerto Escondido and Mexico. Adelina also took me to great restaurants and suggested a lot of things to do while i was there. The nice breakfasts with the other guests was a treat and made it easy to become friends with them. You get the feeling of being part of a family during your stay at Quinta Lili. The rest of the staff are also very friendly and caring.I will for sure be back some day and I really recommend this wonderful place // Lars
50,We stayed at Quinta Lili for 16nights and could have moved in! - 2min from the beach - Big and very clean rooms - Excellent homemade breakfast - Super friendly and helpful hosts! - 5min walk to restaurants/supermarket - Quiet and a great place to relax
40,"We stayed at Quinta Lili in February, and it was a lovely experience.  The host (Adelina) is amazingly generous.   The breakfasts were delicious.  We partook in the release of sea turtles, and that was one of the most special things I've ever done on vacation.  If we were wealthier (my husband's a PhD student, and I'm a teacher), I think I would have enjoyed my Quinta Lili experience even more.  We could only afford to stay for a couple nights and almost felt guity for not partaking in any of the recommended tourist activities in town (all cost a pretty peso).  The building was truly beautiful (Santorini-esque, it is), but nights are hot (and our ceiling fan rhythmically--and endlessly--clicked, rendering it useless), but if you're ok with that, it's no biggie.  It's possible"
50,"I stayed in Quinta Lili for 4 days, and I spent an amazing time. Quinta Lili is not a regular hotel, but it is so much better for that; is the personal attention you get from the hosts, who really help you discover the area and enjoy the best of what's around (sightseeing trips, restaurants, etc...). I would definitively recommend to any friend going to Puerto Escondido, and will also stay again when visiting the Area in the future. I was unsure what to expect at first, but after experiencing first hand I must say it really is the best way to enjoy Puerto Escondido.  I enjoyed everything and definitely want to come back :-)."
50,"Quinta Lili is a great place to stay. It’s very clean, quite and only a few minutes walk from the beach, shops and restaurants. Every morning we got a homemade breakfast served by the pool. Adelina gave us some helpful advice and a lot of interesting suggestions for restaurants, shopping, and sightseeing. She was always in a good mood, with a big smile on her face, making the place feel more like home.  The highlight of our vacation in Puerto Escondido was releasing baby turtles into the ocean and preparing a huge freshly caught fish with the other guests.  We loved Puerto Escondido and our stay at Quinta Lili and can't wait to go back."
50,"Of the 5 places we stayed in Mexico this trip, Quinta Lili had the best host in Adelina.  She was funny and energetic and provided all the information we could have possibly wanted about the region and activities.  She set us up with 2 great tours and seemed to know all the important people and places in town.  As promised, Quinta Lili had a taxi waiting at the airport for us, even though we were over a 1/2 hour late.  This featured was very appreciated, especially since our previous location promised the same but didn't deliver. The breakfasts, as everyone says, were very enjoyable: we loved the fresh squeezed orange juice as well as having both cold and hot courses.  This was a perfect location for us - away from the main beach and tourist area (although only a ~$4 cab ride)"
50,"Our visit to Quinta Lilli began upon arrival where we were warmly greeted by Rosa and Adelina. We had just flown in from Oaxaca and Adelina immediately very kindly offered us one of her lovely mexican breakfasts. She continued to offer lots of information about the area and informed us about the restaurants, shops and beaches. We had a downstairs room at poolside. This room was kept very, very clean by Rosa under the direction of Adelina. We were at Quinta Lilli for six nights and noted that the place was kept immaculately clean and in great working order. There is a communal area with a fridge where the guests can keep a few things if necessary. This communal area offered lots of shade and coolness for hot days and nights. It was great to play cards , watch T.V. and chat with"
50,"this place is the best! it's beautiful, clean, quiet and the homemade breakfast every morning was a such a treat!   adelina is an angel of a host. every suggestion from food to sights and activities were spot on. highlights from this trip were:  releasing newly hatched baby turtles into the ocean at sunset, grilling a 20 pound freshly caught grilled snapper in the kitchen with other guests, surfing, and of course the delicious breakfasts.   basically its priceless here.  cant wait to go back. -theresa"
50,"We had a wonderful week staying at Quinta Lili. Adelina, the host, is warm, knowledgeable and engaging. Her recommendations for restaurants and excursions were very helpful. The B&B is comfortable and tastefully decorated. The rooms are spacious and the evenings are quiet, making for great sleeping. The breakfasts were great. Sitting around the table near the pool to have our breakfast provided an opportunity to meet other guests and make new friends, which we did. The pool is a real plus given the intensity of the sun in Puerto Escondido. We visited the turtle refuge with Adelina and that was a real highlight of our stay. The B&B is a short five minute walk to the quietest and most beautiful beach in Puerto Escondido. The beautiful architecture of the B&B reminded us of"
50,"The highlight of our vacations in Mexico was our stay in Quinta Lili.  A charming boutique hotel, elegantly decorated, serene, and in an excellent location was perfect for us and the week we ve spend there The very best asset of the hotel is of course Adelina which was always adding a personal touch in the wonderfull hospitality, making the place feels more like a home. I would defenitely recommend and surely would love to return."
50,"Quinta Lili is,as described by many,a wonderful place to stay.Its greatest asset,apart from Ade,is its ability to induce instant relaxation!.The fact that a stunning beach is a short distance away....the fact that the brilliant La Torre Restaurant is only a 5 minute walk away....the fact that El Cafecito (bakery/coffee/cafe) is a 5 minute walk away.Its very easy to get into a routine here!.Add to this ....Ade,the perfect host.A great wealth of knowledge and info!.Ask nicely,she may introduce you to the turtles.You may have to ask extremely nicely if you need dropping off in Acapulco!!!."
50,"Ever since our visit last year, we have been looking forward to returning.  This visit did not disappoint.  Quinta Lili is as lovely as ever and Adelina goes out of her way to make your vacation special.  We love the breakfasts, the company, the sparkling clean rooms,  and the charming atmosphere.  We always meet interesting people from all over the world at Quinta making the experience even more memorable.  There is something truly special about Quinta Lili - and we loved their new place, Villa Lili.  One night, a fellow traveler brought one of the fish that he caught home for dinner.   Adelina arranged for all the guests to have dinner together at the Villa Lili.  Having seen it when it was under construction, we were blown away by the stunning beauty of the place.  Next year"
50,"My wife and I had the pleasure to stay several nights at Quinta Lili.  We greatly enjoyed the tranquil setting and the well -kept room we stayed in.  Our hostess, Adelina,  and her staff made us feel very welcome and could not do enough to make our stay more comfortable.  I was especially impressed with Adelina,  , who despite having plans to go out with her friends one evening ,  took considerable time to arrange an ""emergency trip"" to the doctor for one of her guests.  She only arrived back to Quinta Lili, when her much improved ""patient"" did!  We would most definitely consider staying at this B & B if we visit  Peuerto Escondido again!  Eric & Anne   Thunder Bay On"
50,"I have to say that the Quinta Lili was cute, quiet, clean & comfortable, and charming, but what really made our stay so great was Adelina, who was such a great hostess.  She helped us with all the basics (good restaurants, where to find the doctor for my boyfriend who came down with a terrible cold, convenience stores, shopping, etc.) and was fun just chitchatting with.  She booked us our dolphin boat trip, let us borrow snorkeling gear, and really tried to bring us to release the endangered baby turtles nearby (though they didn't hatch during our stay so we couldn't go...).  She even brought us to the airport to catch our flight back to Mexico City.  The included breakfasts at the Quinta Lili were delicious -- fresh fruits, cereal, yogurt, coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice,"
50,"Quinta Lili is a beautifully designed guest house in a quiet residential neighbourhood within walking distance of Playa Carrizalillo, restaurants & shops. Great breakfasts were served each morning featuring one of Adelina's specialities. We appreciated the time Adelina spent with us outlining the options for sightseeing, shopping & dining  in Puerto Escondidio."
50,"Our time at Quinta Lili was perfecto! Adelina, Rosa and Luis were lovely hosts. A special thanks to Adelina who went out of her way to ensure our time in Puerto was everything we hoped for."
40,"We always stay in B&B's if possible and here is a real treat of  one.  I think the most special part of this place is Adelina!  She is a super hostess and very caring of her guests.  The breakfasts are different Mexican dishes every morning and is such a  treat to anticipate  Rosa'sdish of the day.  Lovely fruits and juice to start always.  Rooms are kept nice and clean and is a short walk to  the beach and a little strip of shops, internet and grocery store.  Very good restaurants are just a short walk away and even a Dr. clinic that we made good use of with Adelina's help.  You will feel like you have made a new friend staying with Adelina at her lovely little villa."
40,"The Quinta Lili was a lovely friendly place.  Small enough to be intimater but no encroaching on private space.  The key was the hands-on-service and enthusiasm of all the staff but especially the two owners who could not have been more friendly, engaging and helpful.  The food was great too - fresh juice . fruit and prepared fare - mucho gusto"
50,"A friend and I stayed at Quinta Lili for four nights and we loved it.  Agree with the other reviews. Very quiet, close walk to the beach, delicious breakfast served by the pool each morning. Ade will make sure to answer all of your questions and will point you towards some great spots for eating and shopping.  Would not recommend if you are party-types looking for craziness after dark, you would need to leave the house and go to Zicatella town if you want, but that is quite easy to do for a quick and cheap cab ride.  We loved Puerto Escondido and our stay at Quinta Lili and can't wait to go back."
50,"My boyfriend and I booked at the Quinta Lili for 2 weeks in Jan after reading the positive reviews left by other travellers on Trip Advisor. We arrived in Puerto Escondido late at night but were welcomed at the front door by Adelina with a huge smile and and open arms welcoming us to the Quinta Lili!! She immediately asked us if we needed water or if we were hungry and asked if she could carry our bags up to our room. The room we had booked was FABULOUS!!! The room was on the 2nd floor with our own private balcony and massive bathroom beautifully decorated with colourful tile. This had been the biggest and cleanest room I have ever seen while travelling! Every morning we woke up to Rosa making fresh coffee and orange juice and breakfast with fresh papaya, pineapple, watermelon"
50,"Quinta Lili is a well-designed B&B, a ten-minute walk from the tranquil;  Cazalillo Beach, past several nice restaurants and cafes.  Highlights are a nice fresh-cooked breakfast; great birding near-by; a nice pool and great views.  But the best values are Adelina and her helpful staff.  Adelina organized a birding tour, took her guests on a turtle expedition (one of the highlights), and drove us to the bus station at the end of our stay.  Quinta Lili is the place to stay!"
50,"All that and more you can discover while staying at Quinta Lili. Adelina was very welcoming and I quickly made friends there.  All rooms are nice and very clean. You have to climb down quite a few steps to get to the beach, but down there it is wonderful and nice to swim since the water is a lot calmer than on the main beach Zicatela. I loved my stay there. Though I was travelling alone, I had more the impresion of staying with friends than staying at a hotel. Very recomendable!!!"
50,"Quinta Lili really is as all the reviews describe it: a peaceful, beautiful home away from home in an idyllic setting in Mexico. It is also next to one of the best beaches I have ever been too.  What makes Quinta Lilli a step above even five star hotels are its owners Luis and Adelina.  They really do treat you like family and go out of their way to help you with whatever you require.  I really have never experienced anything like it.  They also provide delicious breakfasts (I miss them a lot!) and keep the rooms immaculately clean.  I have only been back a couple of days and I miss it a lot already!!"
50,"My husband and I stayed at Quinta Lili for my 40th birthday for six days and five nights.  We researched to find the best place where we could go and relax.  We have traveled all over the world and wanted to go somewhere away from the regular tourist attractions.  We were impressed from the very beginning of the booking process.  Luis answered all of our questions and booked the room for us without any hassels or problems.  When we arrived at the airport, a driver was waiting on us and took us directly to Quinta Lili.  It is conveniently located close to the airport.  It only took approximately 10 minutes to get there.  We were impressed from the very beginning.  The house is beautiful from the moment you step into the front gate you know you are somewhere special.  Rosa greeted"
50,"I can really recommend Quinta Lily to all. It was without a doubt the best place we stayed at during our 3 week trip to mexico.   From the minute we arrived we felt like we were among friends. The owners are so nice and helpful. It was nice to even just sit down and have a chat. We got loads of good tips on where to go and do stuff, they really know the surroundings.  You never know who the other customers staying there will be but we really enjoyed the company we got. I believe one reason for that was the way the hosts act, it rubs off on people and make them more open and friendly. They are really that nice.  The building is lovely and everything is neat and clean. The location is just outside the ""centre"" so it's very calm and nice but still close to everything you might"
50,"We stayed at Quinta Lili and had an amazing time.  Minutes from the best beach the area has to offer and if you are seeking more night time activity only a short hop in a taxi and a great location for chilling out. Our hosts kindly arranged for us to go on a couple of trips where we saw so many dolphins and turtles it really surpassed expectations.  One evening they kindly drove us up to coast to a turtle sanctuary where we released some of the baby turtles into the sea which was a great highlight for us of our time in Mexico. Great value, great hosts with so much knowledge of the area who really went out of their way to help us out and I loved the breakfast each morning which was delicious!"
50,"Quinta Lili has everything you need to make your stay in Puerto Escondido memorable, is perfectly located, the staff is very knowledgeable and very helpful, the rooms were clean and functional, I could go on about all the things we liked, but above all, it was the owners who made you feel like at home, we felt soooo relaxed and were able to get rid of our stress. It was awesome, I certainly recommend it."
20,"My husband and I stayed at both Quinta Lili and Villa Lili (their new property) and we were not too pleased with a few important things.  Maybe because the hosts were so busy opening the new location, but we felt like we had no hosts and could never get a hold of anyone to ask questions, or seek assistance in anything.  And they feel through on a pretty important promise.  I had booked with them for a little over 2 weeks, going back and forth between the properties, but both places were booked one night, so I was told that they would find us a place to stay.  We were very thankful and it felt good to be in one person's ""hands"", so we booked with them for the whole time.  They ended up not finding us a place to stay and not telling us until the day before, so we had to scramble"
50,"It felt like coming home. The owners spread joy and friendliness that everyone on the small hotel felt. The vibe was fantastic and everyone staying there had a good feeling. The owners showed us around in Puerto, giving us the best opportunities to explore the surroundings. The hotel was great, fresh, with fantastic breakfast and a nice pool area.  Everyone has to go there!!!  /Jennie"
50,"Quinta Lili is right up there with the best places we've ever stayed, anywhere. It's a beautiful building (one of the other reviewers is right when they write ""Gaudi would have loved it""); we especially liked all the personal touches in our room. As great as everything was, it was Adelina and Luis (and the rest of the staff) who run Quinta Lili who made our vacation so memorable. They made us feel very welcome, the highlight being a wonderful Christmas Eve dinner for the guests at Quinta Lili and their other beautiful new hotel. And the breakfasts were pretty fantastic too -- they were more than happy to serve up some tasty vegetarian options. We've already decided to go back in a couple of months."
50,"Agree with all the other reviews that Quinta Lili is a fantastic place to stay. When you first arrive you have the impression that you are in a rather remote area of building plots, but you will be amazed to find some great restaurants less than five minutes walk from the hotel. Our favourite (possibly in the world!) is La Torre, which was recommended to us by Adelina. Closed on Mondays, but if you're there any other day do go. Adelina is the perfect hostess, except that you feel you're talking to someone else who is living the Quinta Lili experience and loving it. We loved the top room, relaxing in the jacuzzi watching the sunset over the Pacific (but be careful of the very hot water). The new Lili is an even grander project, if you love water features check it out too."
50,"Lovely rooms, in particular the master room on top (only downside maybe the slightly dangerous stairs), great, quiet setting, the best hostess in Mexiko, Adelina, very personal, romantic, quiet place to be. Wonderful freshly made typical breakfast and one of the most beautiful bays in mexiko only 5 mins walk from the quinta. we wanted to stay 3 nights but ended up staying 5 - apparently that happens all the time, Adelina said. So better plan some more days for Puerto Escondido and Quinta Lili!"
50,"I won´t write much as its all been written previously, but I just wanted to reiterate all the positive reviews on Quinta Lili. We had booked for 4 nights and ended up staying for 7 and even after that long we didn´t want to leave! Adelina was the best host, she is helpful, friendly and always smiling! She made us feel really welcome and acts more like a friend than a host. The design of the property is lovely and you can enjoy hours relaxing by the pool. The breakfasts are great too and different everyday.  When we first arrived we were worried we were a bit far from town, but the best swimming beach is only a few minutes walk away and there are a range of restaurants (including Cafecito - yum!!) just around the corner. You can get extremely cheap 5 min taxis to Puerto town or"
40,"My mother and I stayed at Quinta Lili for 4 nights back in August. Everything--and I do mean everything--was PERFECT. Adelina and the staff could not have been nicer and more helpful. The food was wonderful. The location is calm and out of the way (exactly what we were looking for). The food they prepared was scrumptious. The Quinta was just a 5 minute walk from one of the most beautiful, calm beaches I have ever been too.  We woke up every a.m. and lounged on the balcony, reading and drinking coffee. Then we would go down for breakfast (eggs, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee...). Then we would spend the rest of the day at the beach, lounge in the evening (we made our own dinner several times at the Quinta kitchen) and do it all again the next day.   Quinta Lili really was a haven."
50,"My wife and I stayed at Quinta Lili's for 10 nights in October to kick back and relax at the end of a 10 month trip around the world, and we can not recommend it highly enough. It was the perfect spot for a relaxing holiday to end our journey, and the staff were fantastic. Betty and Rosa prepared delicious breakfasts each morning, kept our room spotless and always had a smile on their face. Adelina, our host, was full of recommendations and became a good friend in the time that we spent with her - nothing was ever too much trouble. The beach near the house is the best in town, there are shops and cafes nearby for anything that you need and cabs into and from town are cheap and easy to find. If you're looking for a nice, relaxed , chilled out break on the southern Mexican Pacific"
50,"With all the positive reviews that carefully describe the Quinta Lili, adding more detail seems unnecessary.  However rating the location is difficult because it is in a residential area a block across from houses that are on a cliff over a cove.  Puerto Escondido is spread out with a number of beaches.  Taxi's are very inexpensive, and it is easy to move about the town.  I have rated its location as excellent because it is so easy to get around and it is a short walk to Carrizalillo beach which is a secluded cove and to various businesses including restaurants a couple of blocks away.  We have visited Puerto Escondido three times staying at other lodgings, and this was the best yet. Even if the location seems a bit remote, the friendliness, warmth and helpfulness of the owners"
50,"This is a very nice place! It is clean, the staff is great, the rooms are big and comfy and breakfast is great. It's few minutes from the best beach in town. If you choose this hostel you might want to plan on extending your stay cause it's so good that you don't want to leave!"
50,"Although we stayed at Quinta Lili a couple of months ago, the memory is still vivid of it being the best part of our trip to Mexico!  We arrived flustered one morning after staying at a hooooorrible hotel more in the centre of town (Hostel Luna- Don't go there!) hoping that they would have a spare room, and we were met by the lovely Luis at the door who offered us a beautiful pool-side ground floor room, with the biggest bed in the world! We also had our own shower/toilet, safe and collection of books in our room! The villa itself is a dream, all white, clean with a bar section too. The pool is a nice size, there's also a jacuzzi and heaps of deck chairs. We had a wonderful breakfast every morning that you get whenever you wake up (!) of cereals, fresh fruit, juice and a"
50,"We just returned from an unforgettable trip to Puerto Escondido and we can't wait to go back!!   I decided to book with Quinta Lili based on the great reviews on Tripadvisor and I couldn't be happier with my decision.  Puerto is not your typical vacation spot and neither is Quinta Lili... The Villa is beautiful and very well maintained.  Its in a great location and one of the most beautiful beaches is just a 5 min walk from the Villa.  Luis and Ade are wonderful and so are the rest of the staff - they are extremely helpful and make you feel very welcome.  Breakfast every morning was amazing - and different everyday! Honestly, the best breakfast in town.    I was actually very suprised with the rooms - I wasn't expecting such great amenities.  The rooms were very clean -"
50,Beautiful little place in a quiet area of Puerto Escondido. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were made to feel very welcome. The room was great. It was obvious that a lot of thought had gone into the design and the personal touches.   Will be going back!!
50,"We arrived two up on a motorbike, drenched from torrential rain, and just on dark.  Not sure how we found Quinta but we ended up right outside.  They were so welcoming and friendly and nothing was a bother.  We were ushered into our ground floor room right by the pool.  Friendly lovely people. Great breakfast and if we had had time, we would have stayed longer.  Don't miss this place.  There are also lovely restaurants up the road walking distance and the beach in close proximity.  Julie & Oliver"
50,"We stayed in Quinta Lili for one week, and it was truly a amazing time. The rooms are very nice ...the staff really friendly and helpful. The Hotel also have a good location....really quiet and close to a wonderfull beach. We enjoyed erverything and definitly want to come back :-)"
50,"Quinta Lili is not a regular hotel, but it is so much better for that. I was unsure what to expect at first, but after experiencing first hand I must say it really is the best way to enjoy Puerto Escondido. The location is great, because it is in a quiet part of town but within easy reach of the more lively areas. However, what truly makes it a great experience, much better than a regular hotel, is the personal attention you get from the hosts, who really help you discover the area and enjoy the best of what's around (sightseeing trips, restaurants, etc...). I would definitively recommend to any friend going to Puerto Escondido, and will also stay again when visiting the Area in the future."
50,"This place was the gem of our honeymoon -- a real little paradise where the people are heavenly, the coffee and breakfast divine and the view spectacular. This review is long overdue, and it is a sign of what seriously good folks run this place that all year long I have been feeling guilty about not writing one yet. Our time there was fully indulgent, but in a simple, relaxed way without frills or fanfare. Thanks to Claire, we got to go on an amazing, peaceful lagoon trip during which our guide backflipped into the water to retrieve someone's fallen sunglasses. His move was totally consistent with how we were treated at La Qunita the whole time. I wish everyone there and everyone who goes there a beautiful time!"
50,"It has been a while since my family was at the hotel Quinta Lili, but finally here is our review. Unfortunately, we spent there just two nights since my husband made quite a full itinerary, so those two days were all that we could afford. Like many others, we chosen Quinta Lili Hotel based on the reviews we read here. And yes, it was probably the best choice we could have ever made. This hotel is perfect, rooms was perfectly clean, great pool (kids were enthusiastic about it), good breakfast, superb service. The only thing missing in Quinta Lili is the Internet. During our stay Claire explained the reasons so I hope that your efforts will soon be successful and you will get the line. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful, especially Claire. She was so kind to peek us up on"
50,"My girlfriend and I stayed 3 nights at Quinta Lili and wished we'd booked in for longer, by the time we got there and realised how nice it was, it was fully booked for the following week. The rooms are spacious and bright with sea views and the small swimming view is a perfect place to chill in the Puerto Escondido heat. Adalina, the owner, is very friendly and helpful and breakfasts  are delicious and include Mexican dishes. Location is a short walk from local beaches and local shops and restaurants and a short and cheap taxi ride to the town. Highly recommended and would definitely stay here again."
50,"We spent 3 nights in Quinta Lili and it was nowhere near long enough. Everything about the place was perfect - the staff (so friendly, really made you feel at home), the room (spotless), the small pool, the amazing breakfasts...  If you're thinking about staying here don't hesitate and book now, you won't regret it I promise."
50,"I have just returned from a one week stay at quinta lili.  I have never felt so relaxed on a return from a holiday. From the moment you walk through the gates you are made to feel like part of quinta lii's family by the hosts ( Caire, Adelina & Luis)  and the other guests. The breakfasts were a treat with a different  mexican dish every morning, gracia betty and rosa. Thanks Adelina Claire for showing me around and also arranging trips to see dolphins, turtles and the lagoon. The bbq we had was fabulous and a great way to get to know the other guests. I am already looking  into a return visit and to stay at villa lili (best of luck with that). If anyone is thinking of going to puerto escondido for a holiday a stay at quinta lili is a must, its a home away from home."
50,Quinta Lili has to be one of the best places I've stayed. The hosts are amazing and really accommodating. Definitely one of the most relaxing holidays I've ever been on. I'd love to go back and stay for longer. Make sure you stay for longer than a week!
50,My wife and I stayed at Quinta Lili because our friend recommended this place and we were so happy to find such a beautiful spot!  The owners/hosts are incredibly nice and very accommodating.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!!  We hope to be back very soon!!
50,I spent four nights at Quinta Lily and  I felt like being home directly after arrival. I enjoyed the stay so much. I would like to come back - now! Thank you Adelina for your hospitality and good luck with your second place!
50,"The first thing I noticed when arriving at Quinta Lily was how relaxed I felt when looking at the little bridge that crosses over the pool and hearing the soft classical music from the radio in the background. It was like arriving to a little paradice after a long trip in the asfalt-jungle.   The room my friend and I stayed in was perfectly clean, and we both loved the little iPod-radio. Breakfast was a treat - the best I have had in all Mexico. I especially liked the fruitwater, which had a new fruit flavor every day.   Quinta Lily is very near the Carrizalillo beach(beautiful!), and Adelina was more than happy to help me find a reliable surf-instructor. She was very friendly and always had handy tips or suggestions for places to go and things to see. She even took me and my"
50,"I spent one week in Puerto Escondido and based on the reviews I read on the Internet I decided to stay at la Quinta Lili. That was probably the best choice I could've ever made! This hotel was just perfect in each and every way: Rooms and the rest of the facility were perfectly clean, great pool, AMAZING BREAKFAST, and located in a very safe area right across from Carrizalillo Beach (probably the nicest beach around)! The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. They'll take time to help you to find your way around, and make your stay as comfortable as possible. Someday I'll definitely come back there! Thanks again, Claire and Adelina!!  cu soon"
50,"The word paradise is the word, that is coming to me, when I think of Qinta Lili. You rarely have things perfect while traveling, but that is a place that comes very close to this. It is clean, quiet, nice, the food is excellent, the beach is not far, there are good places to eat near by. The building is beautiful like a piece of art in itself. I hope I find some day the time to come back."
50,"We stayed for a total of four nights and towards the end we wished we had booked more days.  Everyone at Quinta Lily is very friendly and helpful.  They'll help you come up with an itinerary of activities or places to eat at during your stay.  Oh, and they'll let you take over their kitchen if you feel like cooking something for yourself.   Although they don't advertise for this, they're certified mosquito bite paramedics (thanks for the cream Adelina).  I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone that's considering visiting Puerto."
50,"Quinta Lili is paradise! the rooms, location, people, swimming pool...all fantastic!! everything was so clean and everyone was very helpful. the beach a walk away and cabs from place to place were really cheap too so getting to the main party zone or other beaches wasnt difficult or expensive. As a solo backpacker, this was a nice change from all the loud/cramped hostels that i usually end up at. it was great being able to come back to a peaceful place (with a swimming pool) after taking surf lessons and just relaxing for the rest of the afternoon. there were a mixture of people there as well so it was a lot of fun - couples taking a holiday as well as backpackers. Quinta Lili caters for everyone which is whats so great about it. i had a fantastic week and ill definately be back"
50,"I spent over 2 weeks at Quinta Lili and was entirely pleased with every aspect it has to offer.  From my personal pick-up at the airport, to my beautiful, clean, and very relaxing room with a lovely veranda, to the helpful hints and a heads-up on where to go in Puerto Escondido, to the incredibly personal attention of Claire and Adelina...  I truly could go on and on.  The breakfasts were always delicious and healthy, the walk to beautiful little Carizalillo beach just minutes away, the mini-trips to nearby lagoons and horseback riding, all is spectacular.  Whether I wanted to spend time alone just relaxing, or hanging out with other international travellers, I was 100% happy and was quite sad to have to continue with my journey.  Muchisimas gracias to all of you.  You made my"
50,"I hesitate to write this review:  If everyone knew how wonderful  La Quinta Lili is- everyone would go there, and it would all change. Hopefully this will speak to and inspire  those curious travellers who will truely appreciate La Quinta's unique and charming ambiance.     MEXICO:  Yes, it IS a different country. And with the outbreak of the H1N1 virus last yera it took a real pounding in the press. This is unfortunate for a country already struggling, but probably fortunate for you, in that prices will probably be even lower this year as more people stay home. By this time we all know that the incidence is equal, all over North America and Europe...the world, and Mexico holds no inherent danger.  In terms of other reported dangers of travel in Mexico, my sense is that southern"
50,"We stayed for a week at Quinta Lili. It was very quiet and comfortable. We felt at home. Adelina was very helpful. Carrizalillo Beach, the best beach in Puerto Escondido, is a short walk away. Breakfasts were wonderful. We met very nice people for differnet countries in Europe. We hope to return again some day!"
50,"My husband, 5 year old son, and I stayed at Quinta Lili for over a week in July.  It is a beautiful, small inn with  5 rooms, a great pool, and a lovely outdoor sitting area.  The location cannot be beat, as it's only about a 5 minute walk to Playa Carizalillo. Claire and Luis have created the perfect get-away spot and were excellent hosts.  We ended up staying more days than we had originally planned because it was so perfect.  When people ask what the best place we visited in Mexico was, our son tells them the beach and Quintl Lili...we agree."
50,"Quinta Lili is a perfect place to stay, if you're going to Puerto Escondido. It only has 5 rooms, each with its own bathroom. It's a very nice and clean place, and it has its own pool. also, it's very close to the beach where you can take surfing lessons. It's the best hostel with the nicest staff in Mexico."
50,"I made plans to go to Puerto Escondido at the last minute and decided to stay at Quinta Lili based on the stellar reviews I read about it on tripadvisor... I was there 5 nights and I found that everything everyone has said about this place is true. The atmosphere is so relaxing and pleasant that I found myself wanting to hang out at the hotel pool more than go to the beach! But when I did want to go to the beach, it was a really short walk to get there. The rooms are nice and the besds are comfortable. The staff is very kind and helpful. Adelina is amazing and I really appreciated her giving me rides around town and taking me to the best local restaurants. With their help, I was able to experience puerto escondido in ways that i never woud have on my own. If you go to puerto"
50,"This was definitely the best place I stayed during my 4 month trip in Mexico, Guatemala & Belize! The service was perfect, the staff very personal (the people were so friendly!), the rooms were cozy but clean, the breakfast was great (fresh fruit, fresh juices, plenty of different types of cereals and everyday something else: wholemeal toast with eggs, pancakes, typical Mexican dishes, etc.).   The pool had the perfect temperature to cool down and the comfortable chairs were ideal for napping or reading a book, in the shade or in the sun. I liked the fact that every room had an i-Pod docking station.   The location was great as well. Not right in the centre of touristy Puerto Escondido, but near a smaller beautiful beach and near a strip of shops, internet and restaurants"
50,"This is the best hostel I ever stayed at. The facilities are impeccable and super comfortable (nice beds, good water pressure in the shower, hot and cold water working perfectly, tv, dvd player, iPod charger, fans and beautiful either balconies or terraces in every room). The breakfast was all home made including always natural juices, cereal, fresh fruit salad, coffee, tea and a traditional delicious oaxaca dish. The owners of the hostel are extremely nice. They would pick you up at the airport and help you with absolutely everything you need from information about places where to eat and recreational tours to medicines if you have any health issue. In addition to the nice porch and backyard the hostel features a wonderful swimming pool surrounded by soft lighting that change"
50,"out of our experience around the world , a top-class resort :    -excellent service , especially our warm-hearted hostess   -every morning different mexican breakast-experience inluding also cooking tips   -peaceful location (not in the noisy center) ,transportation was always kindly offered   -a place , where you could have company or peace, however you preferred"
50,"I have been travel all over the world with my job as a Sales Manager and this is the best hotel ever. the services is just perfect, I can highly recommend this place to everybody. The environment is very relaxing almost like be in therapy. I just feel like home."
50,"Quinta Lili was my favorite place to stay. My wife and I travelled for 2 months on our honeymoon, staying everywhere from backpackers to 5 star hotels. This beautifully designed and cared for hotel was so enjoyable to stay at that it was hard to leave everyday and see Puerto Escondido. The nicest beach in the area is basically on your doorstep as are some great places to eat. However the food at Quinta Lili is great so you might not even bother going out. The breakfasts were large and varied, you can store things in the refrigerator and use the kitchen when you please. Claire and Luis were great hosts and extremely approachable and helpful throughout our stay. The gardens and communal area are fantastic, but it's the little details which make it so enjoyable. The pool is stylish"
50,"Quinta Lili was the highlight of our Mexico roundtrip. Too bad we had time only three nights, would like to stay much longer at the next time we visit Mexico :)  We liked the way Claire helped us in everything, the house was very nice, rooms comfortable and also Puerto Escondido itself was a very nice place! Also we, as non-spanish speakers, found it enjoyable to chat with Claire and other international travellers, as it was not so easy in any other place at our three week trip to Mexico."
50,"I was in Quinta Lili from June 8th to 22nd and all my expectation were fully met. It was my first time in Puerto and I already knew that I would have liked that town; I friend of mine spent a couple of weeks 2 weeks before I was there. When I looked for a hotel, I started to dig on Tripadvisor to figure out what could have fit for a solo traveler as I was, and Quinta Lili perfectly reflected all the reviews written here. I couldn't find a more comfortable and warmer place than Quinta. As it would have been my first vacation alone, I wanted to choose the best place for my needs and with the friendly staff and the wonderful rooms and facilities: I'm going to keep this hostel in my memories. The location is 5 minutes walk from Playa Carrizalillo, the best beach to swim and learn"
50,"Easily the best place to stay in Puerto! The hosts are amazing, as is the building and pool! It`s a little out of town, but Claire (host) always offered us lifts in, and the walk is lovely anyway! When I return i`ll definitely be staying here!"
50,"For detailed descriptions all the other reviews are absolutely true and reliable guides.  They were the reason I chose to stay at Quinta Lili, but what  I got out the stay goes beyond calm and beautiful hotel.  After the first two days I knew that a week here is not enough and I couldn't help seriously considering staying indefinitely.  Peurto Escondido will effect you this way, you will want to adjust your life to its pace.  Perhaps because the house was designed and build with love it felt like home."
50,"Amazing, intimate and beautiful hotel very close to a great beach.  The manager Claire goes out of her way to make your stay perfect, from airport pick ups to late night driving and trips to see turtles being released into the sea. The house itself is great and at breakfast you really feel like the guest of a Oaxacan family! We could not have asked for more."
50,"It's located 5min walking from two awesome quiet beaches and with a cab (30 Pesos, about 2 USD) you're in the center of Puerto Escondido where you have Zicatela and the bars. There is an included breakfast which is a dream, from hot cakes (pancakes), all kind of Mexican dishes to the classic cereals, there is something for everyone! The rooms have plenty of natural light, are equipped with a flat screen TV, an iPod Dock and SkyTV with channels from all around the world. The owners are so friendly and helpful that you feel like home and never want to leave again, I definitely will go there again !"
50,"Above and beyond!! My trip to Mexico would not have been a success if it wasn't for Quinta Lili.  We enjoyed a relaxing week in Puerto Escondido.  Claire and crew went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable.  Claire helped us find a kayaking and horseback riding tour.  My favorite was releasing the little baby turtles.  Aside from the fun activities available, staying at Quinta Lili was a treat.  The house was spotless and comfortable.  LOVED IT ALL!! I came home and recommended it to my whole family.  We will return soon!!"
50,This hostel is one og the best we ever stayed in.The owners are very nice and they really made us feel at home. They were very helpfull and did evertything to make our stay in Puerto escandido pefect.  The rooms are very nice with sky tv and ipod dock and very comfortable beds. There is a very beautiful  beach just 5 min walk from the hostel and its easy to get into town with a cap.
50,Wonderful place!  Great staff and Adelina was a wonderful hostess!  The locally prepared breakfasts in the morning were fantastic.  Thanks for such a great time and making our vacation memorable.
50,"Everything about the Quinta Lili was fantastic, including:  The building itself. It's a beautifully designed, sparkling white structure just a minute from the beach. It has a sparkling pool that is cleaned daily. The rooms have their own showers are are spacious and comfortable.  The staff. Adelina was incredibly attentive and helpful, and she is fluent in English (in case you don't speak Spanish). The other staff members were also polite and cheerful.  The breakfast! A free breakfast was included every morning. The provided fresh fruit, fresh juice, cereal, and yogurt. This would have been enough on it's own, but the staff also prepared a hot meal each morning (mole enchiladas one morning!). It was enough food to keep me going through dinner!  The price. I split a room with two"
50,"My fiance and I were in Puerto Escondido in the end of March, 2009. We had made a reservation in advance for a double room in Quinta Lili for three nights. After all, there's a lot to see in Oaxaca area and we didn't want to stay long in one place.  Having said that, we ended up staying in Quinta Lili for six nights and wanted to stay even longer! It's a fantastic place and the people there are also amazing! Right after arriving Quinta, Adelina and Clair took us for a boat trip to a lagoon. That was a lot of fun; we saw parrots and a lot of other birds too. They arranged a whole lot of other trips for us also. We went to see turtle releasing, went for snorkeling, they helped us to rent a car... you name it. And all the helping they did for us was free of course. Now that's"
50,"What a fascinating family runs this place!  And what wonderful hosts they are!  Add that to their charming and beautiful house, the fantastic breakfasts, the seductive atmosphere of the house, and you are in danger of spending your whole time inside of Quinta Lili.  Indeed, were it located elsewhere, we probably would have spent the whole three days inside this amazing B&B.  Luckily, this house is also located adjacent to the best beach in Puerto Escondido, so we were not trapped.  The only disclaimer is that the beach, Carrizalillo, can only be accessed by a beautiful but long staircase.  You do get much exercise climbing up and down.  The plus side is that the staircase limits the number of people on the beach, making it relatively uncrowded.  The B&B is a treasure, the beach"
50,"We had a great 5 days in puerto escondido and staying at Quinta Lili was the best decision we made! Awesome breakfasts, rooms, pool and outdoor area, and great location just a short walk from the best swimming beach. The restaurants near-by are good or you can go to town or zicatela by a cheap taxi ride. Adelina looked after us so well and showed us the sights, as well as giving us heaps of info about the local area and the whole country. Highly recommended - would love to come back :)"
50,My Husband and stayed at Quinta Lili for a week and we would never stay anywhere else in Puerto Escondido. You truely get spoiledwith the hospitality and with the yummy breakfasts that Dona Leti cooks every morning. Adelina will go out of her way to make sure you enjoy your stay.
40,"My husband and I spent four lovely days at Quinta Lili. Adelina planned and joined us for both a trip to release baby sea turtles and another to have an evening boat ride around the lagoon nearby, which extended after dark so we could see the sea plankton. Both were delightful, memorable, and very personal experiences.   On the downside, it hadn't even occurred to me that they wouldn't have internet available there, given all the reviews on TripAdvisor. Also, for a place with severe water shortage issues, I felt gluttonous in using so much water in the shower. Installing water conservation shower heads would help minimize the impact tourists have.  I highly recommend Quinta Lili!"
50,"From the moment I walked through the front gate at Quinta Lili I knew that I was in a warm and friendly paradise, secluded in the most relaxing part of Puerto Escondido.  Adelina is an amazing and warm hostess that will move mountains to ensure that you feel like you are part of the family.  Laticia prepares outstanding gourmet/continental breakfasts on a daily basis that will expand your taste in the best fresh foods.  Rosa ensures that your rooms are immaculate each day and even creates interesting formations from the clean towels on your bed.   The short stroll down to the best beach in Puerto Escondido, in my opinion, Playa Carazillao (can´t spell or say the name) is well worth it, especially when you are under a palapa enjoying a refreshing ice coconut drink under and"
50,"Absolutely beautiful, comfortable place to stay in a great beach town.  The service couldn't have been more friendly or helpful.  5 minute walk to our favorite beach, 5 minute cab ride to anywhere else.  Great breakfasts and accommodations in general."
50,"My husband and I spent four wonderful days at Quinta Lili and wished we could have extended our stay longer.  From the minute you arrive at Quinta Lili, Claire and Adelina go out of their way to make you feel at home.  The breakfast every morning was amazing, the rooms comfortable and clean, and the swimming pool a wonderful way to cool off in the afternoon.  We would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Puerto Escondido and can't wait until we can go again.  Claire and Adelina, thank you for making our stay one to remember."
50,"My boyfriend and I spent a week or so at Quinta Lili and really enjoyed our stay.  The room was so comfortable and the fresh-cooked breakfasts every morning were great.  We were a short walk, 3-5mins, from the prettiest beach, Playa Carrizalillo, (in my opinion) in Puerto Escondido.  The location of Quinta Lili was great for us because we were able to walk and eat close when we needed/wanted but also able to take a cheap taxi to the more central part of Puerto when we wanted more selection of restaurants/bars.  The owner of Quinta Lili is wonderful!  She will answer all your questions and suggest some great places.  Everyone who works at Quinta Lili was very friendly and made our stay great.  I definitely suggest staying at Quinta Lili.  We felt very comfortable during our stay"
50,"Spent 8 days in Puerto and after visiting the town, beaches, restos, I was thrilled with having chosen Quinta Lili.  Adelina was a terrific hostess, accommodating, flexible, knowledgeable, always available for your questions. It's like having your own concierge.   - My flight was delayed arriving from Mexico city..no problem. She already knew about it, sent me an email on Blackberry, telling me not to worry, then met me with a smile when I finally landed.  - There are many different beaches near Quinta Lili - She will tell you which one best fits your desires...surfing, snorkeling, long walks, picnics, relaxing quietly. Carrizalillo beach (5 min from Quinta Lili) is perfect for kids of any age.  - Location quite frankly is super. Steps from Riconada district, with everything you"
50,"If there is a paradise, it should be something similar... Well located, friendly atmosphere, nice bedrooms, wonderful breakfast and chill out decoration. The best place if you want to know Puerto Escondido and its secrets...  Don't miss this place!  ;D"
50,Quinta Lili was the best introduction to Mexico I could have asked for.  Adelina and her crew made my stay extremely comfortable and enjoyable and I would recommend this gem to anyone who wants maximum leisure time in a beautiful town.  I booked 2 nights here and I ended up staying for 2 weeks.
50,"My family of four stayed at the Quinta Lili for three nights and had a fabulous time. We had driven from Oaxaca City and arrived hot and tired. We jumped into the beautiful pool and were immediately refreshed. The hostess, Adelina, is remarkably attentive and kind, with all sorts of advice for excursions and restaurants and such. When my son, Max, returned from a day at the beach with a sunburn, she whipped out a home remedy her abuelita used to administer, and we watched the pinkness fade from his skin.  Truly a gorgeous, fascinating place to stay. Gracias por todo!"
50,"We stayed here in the master suite for 6 nights and it was incredible.   Pacific ocean views, comfy bed, private rooftop patio w/shower and washroom, rooftop jacuzzi (actually we used it as a cold tub!), you're own gecko, everything!  The location is great too it's located steps away from Carrizalillo and a short walk to Bacocho or Puerto Angelito.  I hadn't been to Puerto for about 10 years and I was very glad to have stayed here en la Rinconada over Zicatela which is just a huge tourist strip now.  Of course ""La RinCanadá"" is a tourist strip also but it's walking distance to the real town and markets.   Adelina was an excellent and genuine hostess, always making sure we were well taken care of and full of great suggestions regarding any activity you cared to pursue.  Esta muy"
50,"The staff at this hotel are what make a great place unforgettable.  The food, the service, the cleanliness, and the hospitality are outstanding!  Adelina truly loves to introduce people to the best parts of the area, and amazed us with her ability to make the trip special for everyone no matter what their interests.  We can not wait to stay here again and walk from the beach to the pool, and a new restaurant every day!"
40,"Quinta Lili is not just a clean, well maintained place to stay, it is also a great place to meet interesting people from all over the world. The setting is relaxed, being located in a quiet neighborhood near the beach. The food is fantastic! The host, Adelina, is very welcoming and will assist you in any way to ensure a happy stay in Puerto Escondido. She arranged an all day kayak bird watching tour in a nearby lagoon for a group of us staying at the hotel, followed by a night boat ride and swim in the bioluminescent algae. What an experience! We also helped release bay turtles at a turtle preserve, and took a walking tour of Puerto Escondido. We will definitely stay at Quinta Lili during our next visit to Puerto Escondido."
50,"I stayed here twice in a month for a few days at a time and the place is fantastic!  Claire, Adelina and Louis were prefect hosts and a lot of fun.  The rooms were clean and the food was excellent, just wished I could of stayed longer.  The people really did go out of their way for me and my group as we were lucky enough to hire the whole hotel which was great.  I truly great place to stay and I would reccommend it to anyone.  Jason"
50,"This place really is heaven on earth. I am very careful not to be sucked into online reviews but I am finding it hard to say anything negative about this place. From the moment Adelina collects you from Puetro airport, the time with her at Quinta is close to perfection. The room is perfect in every way, the breakfast REALLY is enough to keep you going until dinner time!! There is Sky TV, a pool, clean towels, clean bedsheets and at the end of a hard day on the beach there is a welcoming face ready to tell you where to eat dinner!!  Adelina arranges trips to the turtle conservation project which is truly magical, she takes you to places you never dreamt of eating and if you get sunburnt and she offers you vinegar.... take it, it really does work!!  Everything about our stay here"
50,"We just returned from our third visit to Puerto Escondido. This trip was especially wonderful,because we chose to stay at Quinta Lili.   Adelina is such a charming and helpful host. From the moment she picks you up at the airport you feel welcome and at home. The hotel is spotless and the breakfasts are delicious, plus we met interesting people from all over the world. We were suprised and delighted to find a  terrific selection of great resturants within a short walk from the hotel.   Memorable moments included releasing newly hatched turtles into the sea and a boat ride where we encountered a mother whale and her baby.    We also had the opportunity to vist Adelina""s family's newest hotel venture, currently under construction and we look forward to staying there as well. It is"
50,"I love the people who work here. If I could live there I would and upon arriving home to the grind I missed this hotel the most. In our lives we go on holiday or explore so infrequently that we forget what is important. Being with Claire and Adelina is like being with family; they make you feel at home, pamper you and take you to see, hear and eat things that you haven’t before.  I truly reserve a place in my heart and my memory for the time I had in Quinta Lili. In this lovely hotel I got to know my Irish sister better and woke up late in a lovely environment with my wife to be.  Go here if you can and be sure to have the magnificent breakfast provided, which sorts out a mescal hangover perfectly!"
50,"Upon arrival Claire and Ade will make you feel at home from the moment you set foot on Oaxaca, picking you up at the airport and providing for a typical Oaxaca lunch and local refreshments. An exclusive retreat overlooking the sea, Quinta Lili is a stylish getaway , with five great guest rooms and an unusual open air kitchen with dinning room. Each room also has a balcony or outside seating area overlooking the pool. Ask for the master suite, you will find the open air bathroom and Jacuzzi delightful. Quinta Lili is perfect for relaxing and soaking up in the pool while making new friends. Make the most of the great Oaxacan climate or take a walk to the beach at sundown and visit  a baby turtle camp. You can also try one of the many water sports available along with Luis owner"
50,"Wow, what a place! Claire and staff go all out to make you feel welcome, pamper you and take you places - even shopping, or to the hairdresser or, in my case, to release some gorgeous black turtles on a beautiful beach. I cannot recommend this ""hostel"" (more like a boutique hotel, if you want my opinion) highly enough. Meticulously clean, wonderful breakfast, internet, water, and great company - all at a ridiculously low price. THANK YOU, it was the BEST of 20 hostels around the world I've been staying at. Gold Star material. Eugenia"
50,"A stay in Puerto Escondido will always be relaxing but a stay at Qunita Lili will make it even more enjoyable. A huge breakfast, gorgeous pool, freindly staff and great location make this a place I would reccomend"
50,"We spent a long weekend in Puerto Escondido with a group of friends and took over Quinta Lili, since there are only five rooms. Our group included all ages, from new born to retirees, and were all catered for. We were picked up at the Airport by Claire, one of our amiable hosts, who also took us SCUBA diving, which by the way is very cheap in Puerto, roughly $50 US for two tanks with all gear included! Adelina and Luis, the other two owners took good care of us, taking us out to dinner or manning the barbeque, and as others have mentioned, breakfasts were remarkable and varied; nothing like fresh squeezed juice and sopes! We also enjoyed the nearby beaches and the pool."
50,"What can I say had an amazing time. Spoilt rotten. Great food warm and very friendly people, nothing too much trouble. Very cool layout.Great rooms, super view.Go back again in a flash, just for the home made cocktails ,but not the squeezie butter!!!"
40,I enjoyed my stay here very much! Very relaxing and laid back. It was walking distance from some beautifully quiet and secluded beaches. Staff where very helpful. I'll be visiting again one day!
50,"We were sad that we only had two nights to stay here on our recent trip to Mexico. Quinta Lili is fantastic. The beach is a short 5 minute walk away (loads more if you want to walk a bit further). Restaurants and a shop also nearby. Breakfasts (fresh fruit and sopas!) were great.  The rooms and clean and have nice outdoor space. The atmosphere is very friendly and laid back. Far and away the best part was our host - warm, friendly and knowledgeable. With her help we were really able to make the best of the short time we had."
50,"I spent almost a month at Quinta Lili.  The entire time was total bliss.  The building is beautiful, the pool is excellent as is the jacuzzi, and the entire place is so clean that you could eat off the floor!  Luticia's breakfasts are amazing.  You are within easy walking distance of one of the best beaches in the world and there is also a strip of shops and restaurants locally that can meet any of your needs.  There is a min-mart that has everything including underwater disposable cameras, several coffee shops and good restaurants, a games shop, a library, etc.  You never have to leave the area.  I came for rest away from work and was entirely satisfied.  But, the entire experience would not have been so perfect without Claire and Adelina.  You arrive a stranger and leave"
50,"First, let us tell about Puerto Escondido. It is exotic from the moment you step from the plane. Palms are everywhere and you immediately see the ocean. Quinta Lili is nearby a small beach that is exactly as if from the tourist brochure. Sand is perfect, water is great (clean & warm), and you can have a grilled fish with a fresh cocoa (highly recommended).   If you can wake up before 7am, you can take a dolphin tour. A boat with 6 people will take you far into the open ocean looking for dolphins. In our case, we met a group of about 200 (yes, it’s not a typo, two hundred) spinner dolphins. We don’t know how to describe it – it’s a task you Hemingway, not simple tourists like us. It is a must; the whole trip lasts about 4 hours.   Next, you can (and should) go to lagoon. This is"
50,"Well, what could I say?! I was 2 times at Quinta Lili and every time it was so greeeeeaaaaat! First I was there with my boyfriend in September 08 and I liked it so much that I had to show this place my parents the second time in November. Actually I was in Queretaro for my internship. After this trip I told everybody that they have to visit this place because of the wonderful atmosphere, the great wheather, the great view, ... And of course: Claire and Luis, you are the best hostel owner ever :-) Muchos saludos y abrazos muy fuerte Carina (Philipp, Martina y Andreas de Alemania)"
50,"Well where do I begin and how much time do you have or need to make a no brainer decision.  I was a first time visitor to Puerto Escondido, along with my son and daughter( in their mid twenties) my wife and seester in law.  It was a remarkable experience upon first arriving, I thought perhaps we were visiting family, family that wanted to see us.   Luis and Claire, along with Adelina have created a marvelous experience for guests in this special home/hotel perched on a bluff overlooking the Pacific just outside of the city. ( Less than a ten minute walk to downtown)  From the location you  have any service you will need within a couple of minute walk( even ping pong).  You have your choice of distinct beaches too, within this time frame.  A local beach with local flavor, another"
50,"La Quinta Lili should be renamed ""Paradise"". My boyfriend and I found la quinta after reading the reviews and just emailing to book. Everything was simple so simple in fact that I called a few times to make sure Luis Chavez the owner would remember we were coming. He totally was expecting us and was nice enough to even pick us at the airport. Our room was truly paradise as we had the top room and slept under a palapa with jaquzzi and outdoor shower. I really didn't want to leave. Everything about the stay was beautiful and Adelina and Claire the hostess' with the mostest were really accomodating with wonderful breakfasts every morning. Making friends with other guests can be easy as well if you wish to. The beaches are beautiful and your time there will be a beautiful one. Book"
50,"A beautiful property.. We stayed in the master suite complete with roof top hot tub! Room and property in general - pretty, comfortable, luxury in a laid-back way. The two girls who run the place were so helpful and friendly. They supplied great breakfast, complimentary transport and their friendship! The Quinta Lili is in a good location within easy reach to the main strip of Puerto Escondido. They are also within a quick walk away to one of the prettiest beaches for relaxing and swimming I have seen. I would recommend this place to anyone from travellers wanting a bit of 'nice time out' ..to honeymooners. The prices are so affordable! Tip - definately take the Lagoon Tour starting at about 3.30 pm and watch the sunset. Heaven. Thanks again Quinta Lili!"
50,"Quinta Lili is a beautiful hostel just a few minutes walk from Playa Carizalillo, one of the most beautiful beaches we found in Puerto Escondido.  The staff is fun and friendly.  It felt like we were staying at a friend's fantastic beach house.  Breakfast was excellent every morning.  The rooms are clean and attractive.  We planned on staying for 4 days and ended up staying for eight.  I would highly reccomend Quinta Lili to anyone."
50,"It was like a small beautiful and peaceful paradise next to the ocean.  There are beautiful, clean and private rooms. It seems like a 5 stars hotel, but it`s more personal and not that commercial like the big hotels. It has a little pool to get a refreshing break from the heat and also a jacuzzi for a relaxing time. Claire and Luis were the best hosts I´ve ever met. Helpful and friendly in any situation. They really care about your perfect time there. We could always get a ride from them. And the breakfast from Claire was awesome. Fresh fruits, pancakes and different kinds of cereals. We felt perfectly prepared for a long surf-day after breakfast. Quinta Lili is just a 2 minutes walk away from the playa Carrizalillo, an amazing cove. Good place to learn surfing. I would warmly"
50,"The hostel is amazing, the owners are great. They really care for their guests, give rides and are so helpful. We felt like friends there. The rooms are beautiful and clean. the communal area as well. The nice beach is just a five minutes walk away. I especially liked that the hostel is small so you can easily make friends, It's a great place to stay, to hang out, to relax, to spend vacation. I'd definitely go back. And... breakfast is incredible good..."
50,"I was ready for a complete break.  Coming to Puerto Escondido was exactly the right idea, but staying at the Quinta Lili was even a better idea.  I loved every minute of my stay here--just the right atmosphere, low key--this is not the place for loud parties but for a relaxing and peaceful experience.  The owners are so helpful that after a few days, they felt like friends.  And it is clean and tidy.  I stayed in the most basic room and liked it very much.  Lots of light and space.  There is a kitchen for guest use and a filling breakfast.  The beach is a 5 minute walk--a fine beach for swimming and, at the end of the day, watching the sunset.  I so enjoyed myself, and my only regret is that I could not stay longer!!  Go there . . . you will love it."
50,After a horrible bus trip we arrived at Quinta Lili. What a small paradise. We had a really good time the days we spend in Puerto Escondido. Claire and Adelina were such a nice people and nothing was to much. We could always get a ride from them. The breakfast was awesome. Really good pancakes and daily fresh fruits. The rooms were very lovely and they got cleaned every day.  If I would go back to Puerto Escondido I would defenitly stay in Quinta Lili!!!
50,"I planned to stay for two days, stayed for two weeks. The hosts were AMAZING! Communal kitchen made for meeting people and eating incredible and copious amounts of food fun, easy and educational. Beautiful, clean and private rooms made for an easy get away after a long day in the sun on the sensational beach oh, so close by. So many things to do and see, such a fantastic place to stay and do NOTHING at. Quiet, social, out-of-the-way and close to everything...all in one."
50,"I booked this hostel on the strengths of the reviews in trip advisor.  I was not disappointed, Quinta Lili is an excellent place to stay in Puerto Escondido.  I chose to stay near Carrizalillo beach because i wanted to swim and spend time on a quiet beach.   This hostel fits the bill, it was conveniently located (5 mins away), sparking clean and provided yummy and filling breakfasts.  The hostel itself is a beautiful whitewashed house with an amazing swimming pool and jacuzzi.  I especially liked the communal areas, you eat breakfast around the spotless and unique kitchen which is in the open air. The hosts - Adelina, Luis and Claire were the most helpful and welcoming hosts ever.  They provided lifts to town and made sure they were there to drop you off/pick you up at the Bus"
50,"Adelina, the host for Quinta Lili, was superb.  She took us to unofficial tours that were A-Class. Playa Carrizalillo is five minutes from the beautiful hotel.  Laundromat is walking distance.  Hostel/Hotel seems like a 5-star hotel, with breakfast bar, hot shower, cold AC after long day at beach, and just pure enjoyment...but at very affordable price. Rooms are cleaned once a day, breakast will definitely fill you up. Highly recommend Quinta Lili."
50,"Travelling through Mexican Pacific, there is a place called ""Puerto Escondido"", this is an awesome place to get fun with friends, learn about amazing natural phenomenos like ""Bioluminescence"", practice extream sports like ""surf"" and a lot of other things but the most importat  to get relax from the daily life. If you gonna be overthere, there is a  piece of paradise called ""Quinta LILI"" where you can stay, this is not a common hotel, this is a place that will make you feel like if it were your own house, Adelina, the hostess, is an incredible person who really cares about your good stay, and the place is amazing, it is a big house with a lot of space in each of the 5 rooms that it counts, it also has a swimmin pool where you can swim to refresh yourself from the tropical heat,"
50,"Having spent a busy two weeks travelling throughout the Yucatan and Chiapas, my wife and I decided to unwind in the state of Oaxaca, where a brief 30 minute flight over the Sierra Madre mountains brought us to a surfer's hangout called Puerto Escondido. Most of the research I undertook suggested that the best places to hang out were along the the strip of bay called Zicatela. There was however, a place which had receievd rave reviews called ""Quinta Lili"" which was located about 2kms West of Zicatela. We decided to check this place out to see what all the fuss was about. After a short $3.00 taxi journey, We found ourselves standing in front of a grand whitewashed detached villa complete with an open palapa roof. We arrived without a confirmed reservation, and were immediately"
50,"Quinta Lili is the ideal place to stay in Puerto Escondido. It is set back from the hustle and bustle of the town in an ideal location for the beach. The hosts are out of this world. It is more like you are staying with really good friends. Every evening (only if you wish, by no means are your forced to) they have cool things for you to do. These include place to eat and drink, tours, we were even lucky enough to be taken on a day tour to a beach about an hour down the road...it was the best day out, they drive you around and you have no cares or worries in the world. If you wish to go to the local bars at night the hosts happily drive you to and from. The rooms are sooooo clean, towels are provided and so is breakfast...which is made for you!!! This is like staying in a"
50,"I lived in Mexico for a year and I can sincerely say that my experiences at Quinta Lili were one of the best parts of it. I had the opportunity to travel there a few times, sometimes with friends, and sometimes surfin solo. The owners and staff are good people and actually ACTUALLY care, you're not just a walking money bucket like how everyone else sees Tourists. The other reviews I've read are bang on, they really DO put in the extra mile. Security, local knowledge, fun, - this place is has it all. Food, rides, trips to markets/places, - its all true. This place speaks for itself, you will not be disappointed, prepare to make some good memories, and prepare to miss them long after."
50,Hi guys I was in Mexico for four weeks and Quinta Lili was far the best place I stayed at. It was clean friendly and had a nice swimming pool. It was in a great location and I really could not have asked for any more. Take my word for it stay at Quinta Lili you will not be dissapointed. ALL THE BEST HAVE A GREAT TRIP OLLY
50,"A wonderful place to rest and relax. Great location in a quiet neighbourhood, walking distance to a great surfing and swimming beach, and local shops and cafes. We booked for a few days, extended our stay to a week and then didn't want to leave. Claire and Luis are incredible hosts, where nothing is too much bother. They will take you to the markets, local attractions, and give you invaluable local advice.   This was by far the best place we stayed in Mexico and they yummiest breakfast.  Book in advance - otherwise you may be disappointed."
50,I Spent a week at Quinta Lili It is perfect for a relaxing break. Located less than 5mins walk from the best beaches in Puerto Escondido for swimming and learning to surf. The spotlessly clean property also has a swimming pool if you want a break from the beach. within walking distance of restaurants and shops. 5mins in a taxi to the center. I would definitely recommend Quinta Lili .. after all I came for 2days and stayed 6. Thanks Luis!!
50,"Quinta Lili is by far the best place to stay in Puerto Escondido (we looked at all of them). The place is beautiful, cozy, warm, comfortable and really nice. It is literally a 3-4 min walk to the nicest beach in town. Staying there feels like you have your own little private beach home. We had a private ocean view room with balcony and could watch the sunset from our balcony every day. The outside kitchen is incredibly inviting and we cooked there all the time. They also have an in house Italian chef that will prepare gourmet meals for you if you want him to. Our room was clean and nicely decorated and had cable tv and a private bathroom for a very very reasonable price. I would definitely visit again and stay at Quinta Lili and recommend it to all my friends or anyone visiting"
50,"I had an amazing time at Quinta Lili. The house is spotlessly clean and the rooms are modern and airy.  This is by far the nicest, friendliest place I stayed throughout my travels in Mexico. You can relax by the beautiful pool, or walk to the nearby swimming and surfing beach at Carrizalillo. If you would like a change from the delicious food served up at the hotel, there are some great restaurants within easy walking distance too. Breakfast is also included in the price. The owner, Luis is a wonderful host, always willing to go the extra mile for you. I'd recommend Quinta Lili to anybody looking for a relaxing, fun vacation in a beautiful location."
